Information: ["Pro tip: if you pride yourself on your selection of craft beer, don't hire staff who probably can't tell you how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and expect said staff to be able to tell your customers anything about the beers you offer. Ah, maybe that's too mean. As consumers, we've become accustomed to a huge selection of drink offerings in restaurants, and it's not necessarily a good thing. There comes a point where you either have to be committed to educating each member of your staff about every single beer you have, or you need to significantly reduce the number of beers you feature. After my first visit to Beer Revolution, I'm left with the impression that they'd be better off with my latter recommendation.\n\nAdmittedly, we went to Beer Revolution primarily for food, as we suspected their kitchen would still be open (and I couldn't sell everyone else on Denny's). But we're all fond of good beer, and we certainly would have appreciated some educated drink suggestions from our server. The food (nachos, wings, and pizza spring rolls) was solid pub fare, which is to say excellently greasy and gratifying. However, the interior is cavernous and made table conversation impossible. We snarfed our food and quaffed our beers in silence. \n\nI imagine I will return at some point in the future, but it will be for one purpose: eating tons of delicious bad-for-me food at the end of a long night.", "Met a friend in here for lunch as I'd never been before. I've been to Brewsters and didn't realize this was a sister company. When the waitress told us hat, I couldn't help compare the two. Beer Revolution specializes in pizza and beer but the food menu offerings other than pizza is the same as Brewsters. I just find it weird cos it's a stones throw away, yet they have them both in Oliver Square.  \n\nMy friend got the Caesar salad and I got the crab cakes. They were tasty and decent but I've had better crab cakes (in Brewsters lol). \n\nThe beer options however are really awesome and they display them on tv screens around the bar. I got a half pint of a peach ale and it was super tasty and came with a frozen peach slice inside. \nI'd come again but for the great service and fab beer options!", "Premium Beer?  Check!\nAddictive Pizza?  Check!\nRock & Roll?  Check\n\nYep, their catchphrase pretty much says it all!\n\nI came to Beer Revolution for the first time two weeks ago with three fellow Yelpers after a fabulous elite event at the Taste of Edmonton.\n\nWe arrived around 10pm at night.\n\nFirst, I was impressed with the layout and open feel - there were lots of people yet the atmosphere felt welcoming and conversation was easy - not overly loud.\n\nThe music was of rock genre - a nice reprieve this day and age ;-)\n\nThe booths were comfortable and the washrooms were clean and bright.\n\nThey boasted ( I think) 26 beers and local crafts on tap!  They were displayed on flat screen TV's throughout the bar making it easy to see the current selection as well as specials of the day.\n\nOur waitress, Melody G., was fabulous - I mean, so fabulous that I need to say it again!  Melody G was AWESOME possum!\n\nShe was friendly, informative, and refilled my water without asking - yes, I do say I was in love.\n\nBetween the 4 of us we shared: Armin Pizza, Spicy Wings, Curry Wings, Shishito Peppers, and BBQ Ribs.\n\nThe food was a bounty that filled us all and the price was just right.  Between all the appetizers and 4 beers, our total was under $80.\n\nI elected not to drink as we had just finsihed a whiskey/scotch sampling and needed to focus on food.  \n\nHighlights for me were the curried wings (think more of a peanut satay curry style) and the Armin Pizza (nice thin crust).\n\nThe BBQ ribs appy was also good and the spicy wings were spicy.  The Shishito Peppers are a curious choice - as only 1 out of 4 are spicy so it's kinda like a spicy Russian Roulette.  I was not lucky enough to have received a spicy one, so I think I will take my chances and play again next time!\n\nAll in all this place totally rocked my socks! Oh, AND they had glorious outdoor patios perfect for a summer's night!\n\nCan't wait to go back!  And hey, Beer Revolution is living proof that good things do come out of Calgary (their original location ;-)\n\nPS - I always upload pics - sneak a peek"]

Information: ['Upon walking in, Pazzo Pazzo makes a statement. A big gaudy statue of a butler greets you at the door. Sinatra and Pavarotti blaring from the speakers. The owner, who looks like a mustache-free version of Mario (sans Luigi), running around and greeting everyone jovially. Pazzo, in Italian, means "crazy." Kind of makes sense.\n\nUnderneath, Pazzo Pazzo is a quaint little restaurant tucked away with it\'s understated front entrance on a downtown sidestreet. The food is decent (I\'ve suffered through overcooked pasta a few times) but the menu is large and the serving sizes are enough to feed 2 people. The prices aren\'t too bad and they often have a large specials board featuring some interesting entrees.\n\nMy problem with this place, hence the three stars, is the insincerity in the service. The owner, who seems to be always there, seems to pick and choose who he schmoozes with and then completely turns it off at the drop of a hat. The servers come off as disinterested, unfriendly and impersonal. I\'ve come in more than a few times and stood there in the entrance, completely ignored for five minutes or more, while servers buzz around me, trying to figure out "whose turn it is to take a new table." Italian food, to me, is more than just about food, it\'s about heart, which I feel like Pazzo Pazzo is sincerely lacking.\n\nIf you\'re looking for some nice food for a decent price (and if you are super hungry or wanting to have a nice meal of leftovers tomorrow!) then definitely check out Pazzo Pazzo. Despite my lukewarm review, I continue to visit on a semi-regular basis. Food? Yes. Yum (most of the time). Hospitality? Not so much. Is the former worth the latter? I haven\'t quite figured that out yet.', 'I remember eating here on Halloween a few years ago. What I remembered was I left thinking "The pasta was amazing. Hidden gem for sure!"\n\nAfter a few years, I have returned with a much more improved palette. Boy was I ever naive.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, my pasticcio plate coming up at $17.00 was literally the largest I\'ve seen in awhile. This plate was more like a shield. The pasta filled the entire shield and I couldn\'t wait to dig in.\n\nFirst few bites were very satisfying. After about 5 minutes slaying away at this beast, I noticed that it wasn\'t the sauce that was standing out, it felt TOO salty. My friends felt the same as well. Some ordered the brusceta (spelling?) and the angel hair and all felt the same way.\n\nNo one at our table could finish their meals except for yours truly (I\'m even impressed). The problem was everyone felt horrible after. And I mean horrible in the #2 way. Maybe we caught them at a bad night but my friends frequently visited the washroom that night.\n\nService wasn\'t the best. I think they were understaffed for a Tuesday night; the owner took our order. He wasn\'t there most of the night so waters weren\'t refilled. His tableside manners need to improve (he\'s got that posh attitude like we\'re wasting his time).\n\nThe interior is best described as quaint. It had random decorations (a Teamwork motivational picture above the fireplace? what?). The mood\'s dim and mysterious so I could see people bringing their dates there.\n\nOverall, I\'d probably stick to a Scicillian (spelling? Damn you, Italy, I can\'t spell your language!) Pasta kitchen, Tasty Tomatoe, or the true king of pasta, Piccolinos.', 'Our family celebrated my mom\'s birthday at Pazzo Pazzo on a Saturday evening. We had 9 adults and 5 kids under 9 years old at this celebration. They did not have any booster seats or high chair so I am not sure if this means "children not encouraged?"\n\nI ordered one of their specials veal cannelloni and when it arrived, it looked fantastic. I was a little bummed that I was still in recovery mode from the flu and would not be able to taste anything but I was wrong. My dish was way too SALTY to say the least. My family had the same comment about their dishes as well. The portions are generous and more than enough for left overs.\n\nI did not appreciate one of the servers who came to our table with a bottle of wine that we ordered and then proceeded to scold us "who is the 4th one that wanted wine? You asked for 4 glasses!" She wanted to pour all of the wine out the bottle so she would not have to keep refilling our glasses throughout the evening. Finally I just said the 4th person isn\'t at the table and just to leave to glass there. I felt that the service was a little poor frankly due to fact that a gratuity of 18% was added for a party of 8 and more.\n\nAnother thing that I have never encountered before was a service charge of $2.00 per plate to serve the birthday cake we brought for my mom. Is this the usual practice now?\n\nMy sister in law just also notified me that she made many trips to the bathroom after her dinner from the carbonara.']
