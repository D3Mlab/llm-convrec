Information: ["I've been here multiple times with co-workers, and each time I go it's never a bad experience. All of the staff seem genuinely happy to meet you, and are eager to serve you and share their Japanese food knowledge with you if you require it. \nThe bento box on their menu is really great value if you're not 100% sure what you want - or, if you are like me and want a little bit of everything - the rice is filling with the meat, but you'll also get soup and salad and sashimi and sushi too for a decent price. Do yourself a favour and go with that, you won't regret it :)", "Still a long standing favorite. It's close to the husband's workplace so we've been here a few times. I RARELY have any problems here, but last time we came here my sashimi was room temperature. Gross.\n\nHaving said that, this is THE place to order Chirashi. It's a little different every time and it is a sashimi lovers wet dream. ALL THE PROTEINS!! You could have salmon, two kinds of tuna, mackeral, surf clam, scallop, octopus, whitefish,  marinated mushrooms, egg, and/or fish roe covering a bed of rice.\n\nYesterday was the first time I noticed that Chirashi isn't on the dinner menu. I'm usually all about the bento box, so I guess I just never looked until now. If you do want to go there for lunch, you might want to make a reservation. It fills up pretty fast.\n\nNow about those bento boxes...They're a little pricer than usual at $21.00. I'd say it's still worth it. You still get your standard miso soup, salad, and rice. You also get a choice of three proteins AND you get a serving of fresh fruit that isn't all cantaloupe. All the protein portions are generous. If you happen to choose the sashimi, you'll get 5 kinds.\n\nFour and a half stars.", "2 stars for poor service on a Friday early evening and for food that was subpar in my opinion. We ordered miso soup (which tasted watered down); an order of a new roll with salmon and seaweed salad in it (it was spicy! and underwhelming); an order of salmon sashimi which was decent; shrimp tempura (the shrimp were pretty small compared to other places we've had this at); and also ordered beef shogayaki (which they forgot about - but our server claimed it was on its way). Don't think I'll be back anytime soon."]

Question: Do they have a slide in the restaurant?
Information: ['I really like this place. They have great food.']
Answer: I do not know.

Question: 
Information: ['Last one from our 3 block challenge...also from May 2009!\n\nWe cheated.\n\n\n\nSort of.\n\n\nWe said to each other that we would try to focus on NEW places, places we have only driven by or some we haven\'t even heard of. Well, its only review #3 and we have cheated. We went to an old favorite. In our defence though, it fits EVERY other criteria: its within a 3 block radius and its not a big chain (there are two restaurants in Edmonton). \n\nKyoto is a place that we enjoyed often during our dating days when Heath would come to the city on the weekend hungry for something different and unavailable in Lloydminster. We would often wander into the Japanese restaurant for sushi and warm miso soup as well as delicious bento boxes full of goodies. It occured to us as we walked in today that we hadn\'t been there in a couple of years due to finding a place on Whyte Ave that we loved for a while, and then an unfortunate sushi "accident" that landed me (Jess) in the emergency room before a final exam. I have been slow to warm up to the idea of raw tuna since, but today I was feeling a bit impulsive, so decided to give it another go.\n\nWe wandered into the restaurant around 3 in the afternoon, thinking it would be pretty dead on a long weekend Sunday. We. Were. Wrong. Apparently Lupper is a new thing in Edmonton and we are the last to catch on! The place was packed! We were able to get a cozy booth on the far side of the restaurant though and were quickly seated amongst the new decor. \n\nThe server took a while to come over to our table, but in her defence she was the only server in the restaurant and must have had at least 15 tables. When she did come over, she took our order quickly for food and drinks and miraculously returned in lightning speed with two diet cokes. I honestly don\'t know how she managed to put the order in and pick them up and deliver them in that short of time! Soon afterwards, she was back with a smile on her face and a couple of bowls of soup and bean sprout salad that come complementary with every meal. The miso soup was the same as I remembered, warm but not scalding, and with a lighter form of miso that lended a savory and slighly salty taste. The bean sprout salad was doused in what tasted like miso and ponzu sauce and was deliciously peppery. We devoured both in minutes and were greeted by our mains just in time for the last bite.\n\nHeath ordered a beef rice bowl that consisted of cooked beef, silver noodles, rice, onions, zuccini, and more onions. He added some soy sauce and dug in with some chopstix and thankfully let me have a taste before it was all gone. The beef was simple but delicious and perfect with a bit of green onion in ever bite. I in turn shared my Rainbow Roll and offered him one of my two pieces of Toro (Tuna Belly) sushi, but he declined and told me to "enjoy it" as he knows it used to be my favorite sushi dish before "the incident", and he is a smart man who also knows that if I love it again we will probably be going for a lot more sushi! The Rainbow Roll was huge with 8 pieces of tempura wrapped in salmon, tuna, avocado and mackerel. I enjoy a fair amount of wasabi in my soy sauce and gingerly dipped whole pieces in before not-so-gingerly stuffing them in my mouth. I was only able to eat 4 pieces before starting to get full, so I decided I should probably move on to the Toro. It was just as I remembered it. Beautiful. The meat was so tender it fell apart and the little bit of wasabi rubbed underneath the meat as well as the green onion on top put it over the edge. The "incident" was soon forgotten (it didn\'t happen at this restaurant anyway) and I professed my love for all things Japanese again. \n\nHeath polished off the last of the rainbow rolls and we both sat back stuffed. Our server brought us our bill with a big smile and we paid and left the warm restaurant into the pouring rain to continue our afternoon. Total bill with tip: 34.76.', 'I had a dream.... a dream of a Saturday filled with a dinner of deliciously delectable delicacies. Delivered to me on demand to devour devilishly.  Instead... I got a disastrous day of despair.\n\nThis is part One of Two of that story: Kyoto\n\nThe plan was a simple one, Kyoto for an appetizer of Toro then off to Tres Carnales for tacos.  I was flying solo today since the gf had to work - she actually has the gal to believe saving lives is more important then dinner with me!!!!!! So I called up my cousin and off we went.  \n\nI must note that I love Kyoto - the old Kyoto.  I am a regular diner here and every I come recently I ask myself why im so loyal.  It breaks my heart to have to write this review, but I wont allow my feelings to interfere with the true experience of the day. \n\nWe arrived around 340, and as usual, the place is packed.  So after a bit of a wait (and two servers walking right by us standing at the door) someone finally asks:\n\n"have you been helped?" \n"no actually, table for two please" \n\nWe were seated and eventually someone noticed we were ready for a drink order.  We also ordered our Toro then as well since we knew thats what we wanted;  we also ordered a roll and a few other little things.  \n\nOne of the nice things about coming at this time is that they give you a bean sprout salad along with your miso soup.  Both great. \n\nAfter about 10 mins our server comes back and lets us know the news:  \n\n"Sorry we are out of Toro."\n\nTime for an aside:  I live in the north end,  I drive here because I have come to expect a level of quality and service.  The previous TWO times I have come here they have been "out of Toro." I\'ve only ever encountered this problem once before ANYWHERE else (and I eat ALOT of sushi); and even then it was late on a weeknight... not Early on a Saturday afternoon. \n\n"what do you mean your out of toro, do you guys not sell it anymore?"\n"hold on let me go check"\n\n----- waits-----\n\n"nope we sell it we are just out" \n"ok, thank you please just bring the other stuff"\n\nThe food came and i didnt see our server again.... here is the short version: The rolls were falling apart when you picked them up.  The other sushi we ordered was cut way more thin then is acceptable and generally the free soup was the highlight.  \n\nSince our server decided not to return to our table I got up and asked for our bill... Surprise they charged us for all that toro that doesn\'t exist. Which would be fine if the lady at the till would believe that they were out and we didnt receive it... Lucky that was easy enough to prove.  \n\n"Dont worry cousin Tres Carnales will be much better\n\nat this time you may notice that we didnt make it to Tres.... instead we found ourselves at "Louisiana Purchase."  Read the next exciting installment of Mystery Diners reviews to find out why!. \n\n---\nShort review:\n\nAtmosphere: 4/5- It a nice place; clean, modern, with a nice "vibe"\n\nService: 2/5 - Had to wait to be seated,  then was forgotten about, and to top it off our bill was wrong. \n\nFood: 3/5 - Not what it use to be.   Acceptable but no longer worth the drive to get here. \n\nDinning experience: 2/5 - Not having tuna is not acceptable once, let alone three times in a row. \n\nPrice: 3/5 -  Cost 36$ for two of us,that price was changed due to the non existent toro. \n\nOverall: 2.8 - Will i be back? Yes, but not because I should but for the same reason abused partners keep going back... im a sucker.', "I relented to eating here when my friend suggested it. But if anyone knows me well, they know my top and only choice for sushi would be Furusato on Whyte. Still, Kyoto isn't too bad in terms of generic sushi; they were actually a lot better than I had expected.\n\nThis location is fairly big, with small tables and private low-floor rooms. It's usually pretty busy, and my friend had to make reservations when we went for our group of four. I always like it when Japanese restaurants have the low-floor rooms; it makes it seem more authentic somehow. Although I'm always paranoid someone will steal my shoes!\n\nI wasn't really hungry that day, so I only ordered a few pieces of sushi. I think I ordered the hokkigai (surf clam) and tamago (egg) sushi, along with a california roll. Pretty basic, in terms of sushi. The food was fresh though, which is what you always want, especially for sushi.\n\nThe service was also pretty good, considering they were super-busy that day we went. We had to flag down our waitress a few times, but we got what we needed. In terms of cost, it's about average; it's not ridiculously overpriced that I would refuse to come back, if my friends suggest it again."]

Question: 
Information: ["Maybe it was the grey day - and the hot miso soup, but this tiny sushi shop, north of Jasper, won a small piece of my heart today. \n\nIt's cozy, eclectic - soft white light strands, fake flowers, wicker chairs, assorted pottery for dish wear, Hello Kitty?! and piano music lulling me through my menu read just after lunch hour.\n\nI order the miso, a green onion cake, tea and a plate of Dynamite Maki. The food comes almost instantly, and as I shift my laptop and books to make room for my meal, one of the Moo-Moo kimono-wearing servers comes and fusses over my table, to help me put it in order.\n\nThe food is fresh and good - not the best sushi I've ever had, but better than Wok Box down the street and the place has infinitely more character. \n\nCharacter's huge in my books - and this is a place for quick, stress-busting work lunches, lazy snowstorm afternoons and after-five sake crawls. \n\nHmmm.... sake crawls.", "You can't really go wrong at ILS.  The restaurant is a well maintained hole in the wall just off Jasper.   The prices are reasonable, the sushi is fresh and the service is pleasant.  It can be a challenge to get a larger group of people in a lunch time (i.e. more than two), but if you can it's worth it.  \n\nI'm not going to say ILS will rock your world.  I've never been distracted by a flaw or disappointing time, so I call it a safe bet.", "This is a typical little hole-in-the-wall place, run by a local family. It gets pretty busy during lunch, when hordes of business people flood in during their short break. The rest of the day, it is generally quiet, and every time I've gone, we've pretty much had the place to ourselves. That's a good thing, because there are only about ten tables in the whole place. \n\nDespite the name, I Love Sushi has far more on the menu that just sushi. Don't get me wrong, sushi is great, but there is far more to Japanese cuisine than just sushi. \n\nThe sushi here is average, but what I come back for over and over is the Oyako-don and Tonkatsu. Both are great dishes that will fill you up on a cold winter's day or fuel you up for a night on the town. \n\nCompared to other places nearby (Mikado & Kyoto), the prices are dirt cheap too. If you're looking to try other aspects of Japanese cuisine, drop in and sample a few different things - they won't cost as much as they do at other places in town, and taste just as good (if not better)."]

Question: Do they have a slide in the restaurant?
Information: ['I really like this place. They have great food.']
Answer: I do not know.

Question: Individual Questions: What time do they close?
Information: ['It is a small little Japanese place. Crowded at lunch because it is great food, great price for good sushi. If you do not like to wait for lunch rush hour, go there after 12:30pm or go for dinner.\n\nThe only bad thing about this place is they close down at 8PM, I can never go for dinner time because they close too early.\n\nI enjoyed many lunches and I would go back.', "Business lunch for two people. Arrived just before noon. Place was filling up fast. Server friendly. Friend ordered the food, had soup, rolls and various dishes. We were quite hungry so we got a broad selection. Food arrived fast and looked appetizing. Can't remember how many different varieties but it was all tasting well. Had to rush for a call after lunch and waiter got us our bill fast. Will definitely come back again.", "I have had good experiences at I Love Sushi so I was eager to go there for my birthday recently. It turned out to be my first and last less than impressive experience. I am not sure if the server just made a bad call or if this is their usual practice of giving away a reserved table an hour before the reservation is due. The couple who had our table was not finished when we came in at noon; they looked like old friends catching up not people grabbing lunch at work. We had to wait 15 mins for our table in this tiny restaurant where everyone is staring at us. Not cool. The server barely apologized and did nothing to assuage our disappointment at the experience. The other couple discovered we were waiting for the table and this, I imagine, marred their experience as they departed. So I Love Sushi may have very well lost two customers due to their short sightedness! \n\nI won't be back, not just because of this experience: having to wait for our table and the indifference of the server but also because the food was meh...bland and without much to separate it from Safeway's offerings (theirs may have been better actually). I had a sashimi bento box with tempura. I go to Kyoto a lot because it's closer to work and I see now the quality there is much better.\n\nThree strikes, you're out...which is such a pity because their location across from the park is so appealing :("]

Answer the question below. If you cannot answer the question based on the provided information then respond with I do not know. For example:

Question: Do they have a slide in the restaurant?
Information: ['I really like this place. They have great food.']
Answer: I do not know.

Question: 
Information: ['Last one from our 3 block challenge...also from May 2009!\n\nWe cheated.\n\n\n\nSort of.\n\n\nWe said to each other that we would try to focus on NEW places, places we have only driven by or some we haven\'t even heard of. Well, its only review #3 and we have cheated. We went to an old favorite. In our defence though, it fits EVERY other criteria: its within a 3 block radius and its not a big chain (there are two restaurants in Edmonton). \n\nKyoto is a place that we enjoyed often during our dating days when Heath would come to the city on the weekend hungry for something different and unavailable in Lloydminster. We would often wander into the Japanese restaurant for sushi and warm miso soup as well as delicious bento boxes full of goodies. It occured to us as we walked in today that we hadn\'t been there in a couple of years due to finding a place on Whyte Ave that we loved for a while, and then an unfortunate sushi "accident" that landed me (Jess) in the emergency room before a final exam. I have been slow to warm up to the idea of raw tuna since, but today I was feeling a bit impulsive, so decided to give it another go.\n\nWe wandered into the restaurant around 3 in the afternoon, thinking it would be pretty dead on a long weekend Sunday. We. Were. Wrong. Apparently Lupper is a new thing in Edmonton and we are the last to catch on! The place was packed! We were able to get a cozy booth on the far side of the restaurant though and were quickly seated amongst the new decor. \n\nThe server took a while to come over to our table, but in her defence she was the only server in the restaurant and must have had at least 15 tables. When she did come over, she took our order quickly for food and drinks and miraculously returned in lightning speed with two diet cokes. I honestly don\'t know how she managed to put the order in and pick them up and deliver them in that short of time! Soon afterwards, she was back with a smile on her face and a couple of bowls of soup and bean sprout salad that come complementary with every meal. The miso soup was the same as I remembered, warm but not scalding, and with a lighter form of miso that lended a savory and slighly salty taste. The bean sprout salad was doused in what tasted like miso and ponzu sauce and was deliciously peppery. We devoured both in minutes and were greeted by our mains just in time for the last bite.\n\nHeath ordered a beef rice bowl that consisted of cooked beef, silver noodles, rice, onions, zuccini, and more onions. He added some soy sauce and dug in with some chopstix and thankfully let me have a taste before it was all gone. The beef was simple but delicious and perfect with a bit of green onion in ever bite. I in turn shared my Rainbow Roll and offered him one of my two pieces of Toro (Tuna Belly) sushi, but he declined and told me to "enjoy it" as he knows it used to be my favorite sushi dish before "the incident", and he is a smart man who also knows that if I love it again we will probably be going for a lot more sushi! The Rainbow Roll was huge with 8 pieces of tempura wrapped in salmon, tuna, avocado and mackerel. I enjoy a fair amount of wasabi in my soy sauce and gingerly dipped whole pieces in before not-so-gingerly stuffing them in my mouth. I was only able to eat 4 pieces before starting to get full, so I decided I should probably move on to the Toro. It was just as I remembered it. Beautiful. The meat was so tender it fell apart and the little bit of wasabi rubbed underneath the meat as well as the green onion on top put it over the edge. The "incident" was soon forgotten (it didn\'t happen at this restaurant anyway) and I professed my love for all things Japanese again. \n\nHeath polished off the last of the rainbow rolls and we both sat back stuffed. Our server brought us our bill with a big smile and we paid and left the warm restaurant into the pouring rain to continue our afternoon. Total bill with tip: 34.76.', 'I had a dream.... a dream of a Saturday filled with a dinner of deliciously delectable delicacies. Delivered to me on demand to devour devilishly.  Instead... I got a disastrous day of despair.\n\nThis is part One of Two of that story: Kyoto\n\nThe plan was a simple one, Kyoto for an appetizer of Toro then off to Tres Carnales for tacos.  I was flying solo today since the gf had to work - she actually has the gal to believe saving lives is more important then dinner with me!!!!!! So I called up my cousin and off we went.  \n\nI must note that I love Kyoto - the old Kyoto.  I am a regular diner here and every I come recently I ask myself why im so loyal.  It breaks my heart to have to write this review, but I wont allow my feelings to interfere with the true experience of the day. \n\nWe arrived around 340, and as usual, the place is packed.  So after a bit of a wait (and two servers walking right by us standing at the door) someone finally asks:\n\n"have you been helped?" \n"no actually, table for two please" \n\nWe were seated and eventually someone noticed we were ready for a drink order.  We also ordered our Toro then as well since we knew thats what we wanted;  we also ordered a roll and a few other little things.  \n\nOne of the nice things about coming at this time is that they give you a bean sprout salad along with your miso soup.  Both great. \n\nAfter about 10 mins our server comes back and lets us know the news:  \n\n"Sorry we are out of Toro."\n\nTime for an aside:  I live in the north end,  I drive here because I have come to expect a level of quality and service.  The previous TWO times I have come here they have been "out of Toro." I\'ve only ever encountered this problem once before ANYWHERE else (and I eat ALOT of sushi); and even then it was late on a weeknight... not Early on a Saturday afternoon. \n\n"what do you mean your out of toro, do you guys not sell it anymore?"\n"hold on let me go check"\n\n----- waits-----\n\n"nope we sell it we are just out" \n"ok, thank you please just bring the other stuff"\n\nThe food came and i didnt see our server again.... here is the short version: The rolls were falling apart when you picked them up.  The other sushi we ordered was cut way more thin then is acceptable and generally the free soup was the highlight.  \n\nSince our server decided not to return to our table I got up and asked for our bill... Surprise they charged us for all that toro that doesn\'t exist. Which would be fine if the lady at the till would believe that they were out and we didnt receive it... Lucky that was easy enough to prove.  \n\n"Dont worry cousin Tres Carnales will be much better\n\nat this time you may notice that we didnt make it to Tres.... instead we found ourselves at "Louisiana Purchase."  Read the next exciting installment of Mystery Diners reviews to find out why!. \n\n---\nShort review:\n\nAtmosphere: 4/5- It a nice place; clean, modern, with a nice "vibe"\n\nService: 2/5 - Had to wait to be seated,  then was forgotten about, and to top it off our bill was wrong. \n\nFood: 3/5 - Not what it use to be.   Acceptable but no longer worth the drive to get here. \n\nDinning experience: 2/5 - Not having tuna is not acceptable once, let alone three times in a row. \n\nPrice: 3/5 -  Cost 36$ for two of us,that price was changed due to the non existent toro. \n\nOverall: 2.8 - Will i be back? Yes, but not because I should but for the same reason abused partners keep going back... im a sucker.', "I relented to eating here when my friend suggested it. But if anyone knows me well, they know my top and only choice for sushi would be Furusato on Whyte. Still, Kyoto isn't too bad in terms of generic sushi; they were actually a lot better than I had expected.\n\nThis location is fairly big, with small tables and private low-floor rooms. It's usually pretty busy, and my friend had to make reservations when we went for our group of four. I always like it when Japanese restaurants have the low-floor rooms; it makes it seem more authentic somehow. Although I'm always paranoid someone will steal my shoes!\n\nI wasn't really hungry that day, so I only ordered a few pieces of sushi. I think I ordered the hokkigai (surf clam) and tamago (egg) sushi, along with a california roll. Pretty basic, in terms of sushi. The food was fresh though, which is what you always want, especially for sushi.\n\nThe service was also pretty good, considering they were super-busy that day we went. We had to flag down our waitress a few times, but we got what we needed. In terms of cost, it's about average; it's not ridiculously overpriced that I would refuse to come back, if my friends suggest it again."]

Answer the question below. If you cannot answer the question based on the provided information then respond with I do not know. For example:

Question: Do they have a slide in the restaurant?
Information: ['I really like this place. They have great food.']
Answer: I do not know.

Question: 
Information: ["Maybe it was the grey day - and the hot miso soup, but this tiny sushi shop, north of Jasper, won a small piece of my heart today. \n\nIt's cozy, eclectic - soft white light strands, fake flowers, wicker chairs, assorted pottery for dish wear, Hello Kitty?! and piano music lulling me through my menu read just after lunch hour.\n\nI order the miso, a green onion cake, tea and a plate of Dynamite Maki. The food comes almost instantly, and as I shift my laptop and books to make room for my meal, one of the Moo-Moo kimono-wearing servers comes and fusses over my table, to help me put it in order.\n\nThe food is fresh and good - not the best sushi I've ever had, but better than Wok Box down the street and the place has infinitely more character. \n\nCharacter's huge in my books - and this is a place for quick, stress-busting work lunches, lazy snowstorm afternoons and after-five sake crawls. \n\nHmmm.... sake crawls.", "You can't really go wrong at ILS.  The restaurant is a well maintained hole in the wall just off Jasper.   The prices are reasonable, the sushi is fresh and the service is pleasant.  It can be a challenge to get a larger group of people in a lunch time (i.e. more than two), but if you can it's worth it.  \n\nI'm not going to say ILS will rock your world.  I've never been distracted by a flaw or disappointing time, so I call it a safe bet.", "This is a typical little hole-in-the-wall place, run by a local family. It gets pretty busy during lunch, when hordes of business people flood in during their short break. The rest of the day, it is generally quiet, and every time I've gone, we've pretty much had the place to ourselves. That's a good thing, because there are only about ten tables in the whole place. \n\nDespite the name, I Love Sushi has far more on the menu that just sushi. Don't get me wrong, sushi is great, but there is far more to Japanese cuisine than just sushi. \n\nThe sushi here is average, but what I come back for over and over is the Oyako-don and Tonkatsu. Both are great dishes that will fill you up on a cold winter's day or fuel you up for a night on the town. \n\nCompared to other places nearby (Mikado & Kyoto), the prices are dirt cheap too. If you're looking to try other aspects of Japanese cuisine, drop in and sample a few different things - they won't cost as much as they do at other places in town, and taste just as good (if not better)."]
