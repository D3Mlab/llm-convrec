She had a glass of white, myself it was red.  She ordered pasta with white sauce.  Myself, a true favourite with Bolognese.  Oh man, they do it right.  I will say though, I've had better.  I really enjoy the Bolognese sauce at Craft.  But overall nice night, good food, great company.", "As if the South End location didn't end up scaring me out of SPK for good. \n\nSunday night with grumbling stomachs led us downtown in need of some sustenance. First thought was to visit Jang again but they weren't open so our next closest spot was of course SPK Downtown. I mean being on Jasper for so long, it's hard not to know how iconic and familiar SPK is. Offering more of a sophisticated dining experience with some traditional well rounded Italian dishes. \n\nThe space is dated, with exposed brick paired with white leather back cushions, dark wooden tables and chairs layered with white linen tablecloths dressed with white paper on top. The space was trying to feel formal and sophisticated but the detailing didn't seem elevated. MUCH better compared to their south location though, so I'm fine. \n\nService was amazing, she knew her food and definitely knew her wine. She ended up suggesting the Murcatto wine, a white wine, ended up really enjoying how light this was. She was also diligent in coming by throughout the dinner for refills and clearing plates and dishes. diligent and friendly service. \n\nSalsiccia - ($15) - Italian sausages with bell peppers and mushrooms mixed in with tomato sauce. I mean this was okay, the tomato sauce wasn't as flavorful as I'd want it to be and the Italian sausages weren't at all spicy. \n\nBruschetta - ($10) - Felt like the crostini could have been toasted a little more for more of a crunch. \n\u200b\nInsalata Arugula - ($9) - Way waaaay too much dressing. Balsamic is already super strong and this was swimming in it. We probably had a few bites each and didn't end up taking any of it home. Maybe just get it on the side or something but man, this was like balsamic shallot vinaigrette soup. \n\nManzo - ($38) - We ended up sharing this as our main, the 10oz grilled tenderloin was actually two slabs of 5oz placed on top of each other. Which worked out well for us. We asked for medium rare and it came out perfectly. This was a really good piece of meat. The porcini mushroom glaze was an awesome accompaniment, thick enough to coat each bite. The truffle oil roasted potatoes are another thing completely! Boiled and then pan fried I suppose making the outer corners crispy and beautifully browned while the inside was moist and creamy. Not each piece was consistent in getting the same sear though. \n\nSo, clearly between the two of us we over ordered. Ended up taking a bunch of it home for left overs and they heated up well, still tasted good the next day! Portions were huge, definitely didn't expect that much food but it seems like their dishes are meant to be more family style dining. So i'd say pretty good value. As for, would I recommend? Maybe just for the mains and a bottle of wine. Even with the friendly service and how delicious the manzo was, wouldn't be enough for me to come back.", 'Just had a late lunch here with my husband. The restaurant was clean with a relaxed quiet atmosphere. Service was excellent with one waitress to about 6 tables. The menu is full on classic Italian dishes. I went with the crab and scallop with a cream sauce on fettuccine. It was light but filling. The plate was full enough for two for sure. \nWe left to full for dessert but will be back because they have the best tirramiso in Edmonton.']

Service was excellent with one waitress to about 6 tables. The menu is full on classic Italian dishes. I went with the crab and scallop with a cream sauce on fettuccine. It was light but filling. The plate was full enough for two for sure. \nWe left to full for dessert but will be back because they have the best tirramiso in Edmonton.', "I've been going to SPK for probably 10 years now and I, overall, really enjoy the food here. The menu has changed over the course of the 10 years but it's still one of my go to places. One of the best options on the SPK menu is probably their half and half, which allows you choose two different pastas on the menu. It's a nice way to get to try two different pastas, especially if you're having a hard time deciding. SPK's tiramisu dessert is also one on the best I've had - it's creamy and rich without being I really heavy and is perfect for sharing. Service is usually really great too and in the summer their patio is the perfect spot to have dinner and drinks."]

That being said you can still get your all meat, or hawaiian, they just may be a little more adventuresome that the regular \'order it to the front door\' variety.  \n\nI was there because a colleague won a business card draw from the last time we visited.  7 of us were treated to free appies, meals, desserts and non-alcoholic bevies.  Wonderful service, wonderful food and if you go you MUST MUST MUST try the Nutella Mocha.  Did I mention you MUST MUST MUST try the Nutella Mocha?  \n\nEnjoy this little slice of Italy!
