I really enjoy the Bolognese sauce at Craft.  But overall nice night, good food, great company.", "As if the South End location didn't end up scaring me out of SPK for good. \n\nSunday night with grumbling stomachs led us downtown in need of some sustenance. First thought was to visit Jang again but they weren't open so our next closest spot was of course SPK Downtown. I mean being on Jasper for so long, it's hard not to know how iconic and familiar SPK is. Offering more of a sophisticated dining experience with some traditional well rounded Italian dishes. \n\nThe space is dated, with exposed brick paired with white leather back cushions, dark wooden tables and chairs layered with white linen tablecloths dressed with white paper on top. The space was trying to feel formal and sophisticated but the detailing didn't seem elevated. MUCH better compared to their south location though, so I'm fine. \n\nService was amazing, she knew her food and definitely knew her wine. She ended up suggesting the Murcatto wine, a white wine, ended up really enjoying how light this was. She was also diligent in coming by throughout the dinner for refills and clearing plates and dishes. diligent and friendly service. \n\nSalsiccia - ($15) - Italian sausages with bell peppers and mushrooms mixed in with tomato sauce. I mean this was okay, the tomato sauce wasn't as flavorful as I'd want it to be and the Italian sausages weren't at all spicy. \n\nBruschetta - ($10) - Felt like the crostini could have been toasted a little more for more of a crunch. \n\u200b\nInsalata Arugula - ($9) - Way waaaay too much dressing. Balsamic is already super strong and this was swimming in it. We probably had a few bites each and didn't end up taking any of it home. Maybe just get it on the side or something but man, this was like balsamic shallot vinaigrette soup. \n\nManzo - ($38) - We ended up sharing this as our main, the 10oz grilled tenderloin was actually two slabs of 5oz placed on top of each other. Which worked out well for us. We asked for medium rare and it came out perfectly. This was a really good piece of meat. The porcini mushroom glaze was an awesome accompaniment, thick enough to coat each bite. The truffle oil roasted potatoes are another thing completely! Boiled and then pan fried I suppose making the outer corners crispy and beautifully browned while the inside was moist and creamy. Not each piece was consistent in getting the same sear though. \n\nSo, clearly between the two of us we over ordered. Ended up taking a bunch of it home for left overs and they heated up well, still tasted good the next day! Portions were huge, definitely didn't expect that much food but it seems like their dishes are meant to be more family style dining. So i'd say pretty good value. As for, would I recommend? Maybe just for the mains and a bottle of wine. Even with the friendly service and how delicious the manzo was, wouldn't be enough for me to come back.", "This is my least favourite restaurant in town. The food was just bad, its a typical Alberta restaurant they use nice ambiance to distract you from the slop you are about to eat. I really don't like this place. I love Italian food but it need to be fresh and free of what I can only describe as 'can taste'. There are so many better places in town that I would recommend before this place and sadly even Swiss Chalet is on that list."]
