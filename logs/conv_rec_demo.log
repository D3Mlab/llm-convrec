Famoso pizza is by far my favourite pizza by flavour and price in general however this is not my favourite location -- maybe I'm just too used to visiting the flagship location on Jasper Avenue? The last time I visited here my order was not delivered to me correctly and so staff had to remake my pizza which was dealt with nicely, but it would have been nice if this was dealt with properly the first time. The wait staff was super friendly and helpful however and so I can't fault that at all!\n\nI've been here with just a friend or two and I've been here with a larger group and it's a great restaurant to visit for folks who are vegan or vegetarian. It's also nice to visit a location that isn't always as busy as the Jasper Avenue one.", "My friend had her birthday dinner here, which was pretty much an excuse to finally get to try this place out, as my partner was always whiny and complainy about how soggy the pizzas are whenever I bring it up.\n\nNote to self: Never trust Sean's opinion ever again.\n\nI ordered the San Andreas Pizza and a peach-flavoured Italian Soda, both of which came quickly. The menu states that pizzas are only in the ovens for 90 seconds, so if you're starving and on Whyte or Jasper Avenue check this place out. My pizza was topped with juicy tomatoes, cilantro, bits of chicken, slices of avocado and drizzled in a light cream sauce. \n\nIt was a bit messy to eat, but who doesn't like to get messy from time to time? Let your inner barbarian out and enjoy the tastiness that lays before you. And who needs that strict diet? Certainly not you! Treat yourself to a nutella banana pizza and maybe some gelato afterwards. You've earned it...unless your name is Sean S. -_-"]

Information: ["I like this pizza shop, it is better than other pizza shop and also expensive than Domino's etc. The quality and taste of pizza is great. The price is acceptable and vegetables looks fresh. I guess because it locates at Jasper ave, the lunch time is not good time to enjoy the food.

Overall, it worth to give a try.", "Uh, love LovePizza? - Ya I do!! \n\nFirst off, when I walked into this chic black & white tiled resto, I was taken aback as to how large and airy it is. Because it's located in the business plaza on 109th and Jasper Ave that is full of tiny businesses, I assumed it would be quite small as well - more of a take-out place with 4 or 5 tables. Boy was I wrong! With a vaulted ceiling, huge windows, and seating for what looked like 40, this place is wide open and ready to rock! \n\nAfter going up to the counter to order, the staff assemble you made to order pizza and put it through an oven. It them comes out the other side and is topped with more ingredients. Pro Tip: no matter what 'za you order, get them to drizzle the balsamic reduction on it - it is delicious!! I went with the Old MacDonald pizza on whole wheat crust.... with locally farm sourced sausage, a free range egg on top, amazing cheeses, all I can say is that it was fantastic and I am really, really impressed. Also, I like that they have pizza boxes out for you to package up what you don't eat. Because even though this was 1:30pm, and I was famished from not eating breakfast, I only ate half of my $12 pizza, and took the rest for a midnight, merlot induced snack. \n\nOther highlights that make me love, love, love this place: A wonderful beet salad. Pinocchio ice cream. Local beers and decent wine & prosecco. Free parking. A chic environment and lovely restrooms.", "Love pizza kind of just popped up in the 109st and jasper ave square where save on is. Love pizza is set up like burger priest, in that it's designed to be a nicer and better quality version of fast food dining. The restaurant partners with local companies so they carry grizzly paw beverages and Pinocchio ice cream (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio). Oh and they have beer and wine!\n\nThere was a variety of pre-set pizzas on their menu but they also give you the choice of making your own. They also give you the choice of whole wheat or normal (?) crust and the pizzas are all thin crust to decrease cooking time. We got the Holy Shiitake and the Meatatarian, both were really good, and split the pistachio ice cream for dessert. The ice cream was delicious to.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try the other pizzas. Definitely be back."]

I don't like that you order at the cashier and they just bring you your food. no waiter service for food, just drinks.", "Since the food is what it's mostly about lets get everything else out of the way! Service? Stellar, friendly, helpful, and dare I say attractive? Price? Cheap, cheap, cheap! Wallet friendly from start to finish, so pony up kids! Decor? Who cares? It's clean, trendy, open and it smells delicious inside. The patio is a great escape as well and pairs nicely with a cocktail. Wink, wink. \n\nFood. Let's do this. (Bare in mind I'm doing this on a full stomach, in a particularly salty mood with a three year old jumping around like my living room is an olympic gymnastics practice room. My point? Im being only slightly biased and completely objective.) \n\nPizza is delicious, and I hate this word, with a passion. Nothing comes from a frozen state, its tradition thin crust with foldability and the cheese is to die for. Literally, I almost got hit by a car running to the front doors. I'd die for this cheese. I order it in every form available for purchase: Appetizers, pizza, salad, you name it! Do it! \n\nThe drinks are always delicious and the women working the counter are always prepared to offer suggestions, and they NEVER up-sale. They don't work on commission, folks! \n\nEverything else? You've got dry wines, lovely salads, beautifully arranged lunch pairings, spicy thai pizza, duck pizza, gelato, espresso, tiramisu, berry lemonade...I could go on. I won't. I think I just heard a lamp break...you get the point. Just go, already!", "Amazing! The staff is fantastic and friendly and always easy to find. The menu is fantastic, and since you order at the bar, they provide a well designed notepad for you, so you don't forget your order, especially for multiple people! Our wait time for pizza couldn't have been longer than ten minutes, it was fresh, piping hot and gourmet. \n\nI'm lactose intolerant, so at first I was glad for the Marinara pizza that doesn't include cheese. But then I saw that they offer free substitution of Daiya vegan mozzarella for any of their cheeses! I was euphoric, dining out can be hard when you're lactose intolerant and I was thrilled that Famoso offered an option that meant I could enjoy nearly their whole menu! \nThanks Famoso!!!!"]

Question: What kind of menu do they offer?
Information: ["If you love unique taste and supporting local businesses this place is perfect. Upon coming in the place is clean and bright. Staff were waiting to take your order. Some menu options but also a make your own with a list of the ingredients. They also have dessert pizza, ice cream and salad. We went with the menu and got the Ukrainian and old macdonald. Both were very good but for some reason I found missing something but I couldn't figure out what it was. I loved that all the ingredients are locally sourced. Makes it that much more yummy. The cute message on the wall about how the business came about was also adorable and made me love this place without even trying the food. Definitely want to go back and try some of the other options and settle on one that I love!", "Mango and coconut gelato???  To die for!!\n\nPizza is ok, not the best of its type,wouldn't be my first choice when the craving sets in.  The location is fun because its surrounded by a zillion other little places to eat, which may not be to its advantage.  However, love all the glass and high ceiling and chic decor.  They even make it easy to take home that last piece by putting take-out boxes within easy reach.", 'Fast efficient service. \nLoved choices!\nWhole wheat dough, spicy tomato sauce, great toppings. You make your own or order  off menu. \nLarge pizzas. Innovative combinations! \nDefinitely a return!!']
