Great cover up!  My wife loves it .,0206335962
"Very cute and the red ""stitch"" color was very vibrant!",160832222X
"This says 18-24 months, The baby wears 24 months to 2T but this was swimming on him",160832222X
"Used as Halloween costume for my large 10 week old. Held up well and he looked adorable. Wish the ""stitching"" was also on back.",160832222X
Nice looking and well made.  Looks cute for photos or to create a signature craft for a baby shower.,160832222X
Love it- super cute and fits my 13 month baby girl perfectly. Just wish it came in pink,160832222X
It is somewhat bid for a new born..will fit later..I choose this because the baby's father is a baseball player,160832222X
The onesie is really nice and exactly what I was looking for. I give 2 stars only for misleasing info on the size side. I followed the guidelines and bought the size that would fit my son based on height and weight - however it is very very large and I need to return it.,1608322254
"Love this! We're huge football fans, so this is perfect for our son. It does fit a little big, but he's below average in weight for a 3 month old. Since it's the start of football season, that gives us plenty of time for him to grow into the outfit. The outfit has been worn twice already, washes well and is goo quality.",1608322254
"great product, easily donned, looks so cute, conversation piece, my grandson is the center of attention. He gets passed around the family members just like a football.",1608322254
would like a more polished leather on the pants.,3999852739
"It's only a tiny little bit smaller then the regular size
So, don't go a size higher, I didn't need it
and exquisite leather
just a fantastic leather pants",3999861517
"Arrived today, I should have read the other  reviews on their page. I wear a Levi's 34, Bockle's 34 was too small.. bummer! Sending back for a 36 hopefully it'll work. I love the leather they use, it's great, very soft/pliable (not the hard like cardboard ones, that come from Pakistan you see on other sites) and they look to be well made. Once I get the sizing right, I'll be an even more happy camper!

Great fit and excellent quality of the leather.,3999852070
"As usual, these Bockle pants are first class--superior design, materials, and manufacture. I always get compliments when I wear them. They conform well to the wearer.",3999852070
"Simply amazing.
They are slim fit, so be honest with yourself when picking size. The cut is wonderful, and the leather quality is high. I've seriously considered buying a second pair.",3999852070
Slightly short in the inseam restricting movement to some extent,3999862548
"Nice quality leather, the waist size is smaller than a US size.",399986236X
When I tried them on they were  much too tight at the waist and were in fact smaller than a 33 in their cargo leather pants . I returned them to Germany requesting an exchange but unfortunately size 34 was not available and I am receiving a total refund of the cost . Have now sort sizing advice from Bockleder in Germany on a pair of Buffalo based on my actual waist measurement in cm which also matches my best fitting pants . Styles and the design cut means that you may not always wear the same . The quality and fit ( if you get the right size ) of their leather pants is outstanding.,399986236X
"my new favs!  These leather pants are extremely soft and mold quickly to your body!
I can't get over the quality of the leather for this price!",399986236X
"I really love the pants, but somewhat small. Very soft leather and like the detail stitching and design",399986236X
My new favorite joggers. I love the way they fit and feel. Very nice for the price.,3999862637
I'm 175cm 75kg. I ordered XL.  waist loose but  calf  tight.,3999862637
"Highly recommend.  Extremely comfortable, and great for just hanging around.  Also stylish enough to go out on the town!  These pants are a head turner, you will be a hit in these!!!",3999862637
"Definitely worth. The leather is great, comfortable and fully lined. Nice and warm for the winter.",3999862637
"Bockle products are uniformly good values on Amazon. One caveat. If have a shorter torso as I do, the length from shoulders to waist is very long, and you might want to take a pass.",3999862742
I love the Camouflage jumpsuit. The fabric is very soft and comfortable and I loved the idea that I could my black high heel fashion boots of my open toe black sandals.,5378837308
Fits large so he was unable to wear it for planned pictures.,5780122040
Fit a little sung. And a little long. Not to bad  But it will work my daughter wears a 2t and I bought a 3t will do the justice for our pregnancy announcement,5780122040
Runs very very small and tight material is kinda of like a spandex material,5780122040
I bought this for my daughter to announce that we're having another baby and it fits amazing! It's also a lot prettier than I expected.,5780122040
"Cheaply made. Plus, took almost 6 weeks to get here. By then I needed to buy a gift elsewhere.",5780122040
"Its a cute shirt but the sizing is way off. After reading the reviews I decided to order a 3T for my 19 mo old. It fit her perfect! .. I washed it in cold and DID NOT put it in dryer. If I did, it would never fit. This shirt def won't fit on a cpl months.",5780122040
"Bought as a set for my 2 grandsons and my granddaughter when the youngest brother was born. They love wearing them together, and my daughter-in-law likes them too.",5780122040
Such a cute shirt. The 3T is a little bigger than an average 3T shirt but not too much.,5780122040
The shirt is so cute but the siding is horrible. I ordered a 6 youth girls shirt and it fits my 12 month old niece.,5780122040
"Bought this for our pregnancy announcement, it was perfect and so cute.",5780122040
"This shirt is adorable! The material is better than expected, nice stretchy material. Fits my daughter perfectly.",5780122040
"This shirt is very cheaply made. The first time my son wore it the snap broke as I was changing his diaper. Super cheap, would not recommend.",5780122040
"Very cute, very soft. Fits a little big, but my daughter is tall so I'm glad for that. My only complaint is that it's dry clean only for a kid's shirt, which is ridiculous.",5780122040
"Bought a 5 for my 4 year old and it is way too small. Fits a 3 year old perfectly but If I washed it, it would fit a 2 year old",5780122040
Good quality and fits as expected,5780122199
The digital print on the shirt is super crappy!,5780122199
Cute and soft shirt for my daughter!!!,5780122199
"Helped us announce our news, comfortable shirt, fit as expected (based on reviews of fit). We're getting a LOT of wear out of this one because big sister is excited.",5780122199
"Excellent quality, very soft and better/prettier than expected!",5780122199
Very cute just runs really small.,5780122199
Looks as cute as the photo.  Perfect for the little sister.,5780122199
Terrible to get mail that is supposed to be so special and realize that quality control is not a priority. Design is not even centered. How can you screw up so much on something that is small?,5780122199
ordreed a perfect size for a gift and it fit more for a doll then the baby,5780122199
Very cute. Order up a size my small two year old is wearing the 4t size and she's only 28lbs. I ordered up two sizes hoping to extend how long she will be able to wear it but it fits perfect now.,5780122199
This bed jacket works well for my mother. It washes easily and doesn't shed.,6030555170
"Definitely too small for a bed jacket which is supposed to fit over PJ's or a night gown. I purchased for my Mother who is in a nursing home.
The company said that I could return the bed jacket, however they did not pay the return postage which I had to pay for.",6030555170
"Got this for my sister in cancer treatment, in and out of hospital. She loves it, like the color. Makes me happy.",6030555170
"Bought as Christmas gift for my mother--the ""Queen of Bed-Jackets."" Love it! Beautiful and well made, true to size.",6030555170
"Also a gift for someone else, she liked it too.",6030555170
Runs small order size larger. I did from other reviews and it fit.,6040115440
It came quickly and was just what I wanted. thank you,6040115440
The back is short so do not get if you need coverage below the top of your back.  Very cute item and great quality!,6040594926
"Very, very sheer. Much more sheer than the picture. Did not feel any more modest than going sleeveless. I did not wear it at the wedding.",6040595175
I was nervous to purchase this since it ships over seas.  but it arrived earlier than it said it would.  It's a little more white than ivory but it fits like it should.  The seam running up the arm is a little more visible than I would have liked it to be but hopefully I can tug it out of sight the day of the wedding.,6040595175
"I say it fit as expected because I followed the advice of the reviews and ordered up a size.  I'm a 10/12 normally a large, but I ordered an extra large and it fit great.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It took a few weeks to get, so make sure you have enough time for it to come in.  But the color matched my dress exactly and it stayed in place throughout the entire wedding and reception.",6040595175
I'm usually a large but I ordered an extra large. I think I could've fit in the large though since the back is stretchy. Overall good material and arrived fast.,6040972467
"This was too big for me in the bust area (and I think the waist too). I'm small though. I'm about 100 lbs. and 5'3"". I would have to take it in to wear it. This might be a normal ""larger small"" size that I run into a lot when looking for clothes. The dress didn't look like anything really special, though I might would have thought differently if it fit me right (but it might have also been the material). I felt like I had wasted money, but I kept in it hopes of adjusting it.",6040972467
cute. good summer dress. its flowy and flattering.,6040972467
"the dress is so cute, it fits a bit large and there is a lot of extra fabric from waist down. I wish it was less 'full'",6040972467
"This dress fit fairly well, except that I'm pretty well endowed, so to pull this dress off would require a tank or something so I'm not showing off to the world.  The skirt is a fuller a-line.  Not bad, but not appropriate for where I wanted to where it.",6040972467
"The dress was pretty but there were two huge drawbacks.  It smelled horrible when it arrived.  Cigarette smoke and something else I couldn't identify, but it was potent.  Also, the navy band around the waist is embroidered with a pretty flower design, but the embroidery is completely crooked.",6040972467
LOVE it! Hubby does too - can wear with or without a petticoat if you're going for a vintage look,6040972467
"The fit on this is awesome, and I love the design. However, a few things prevent me from rating it higher than three stars. First, even with the adjustable straps (which are nice), the chest area is way too low. I'm nursing (one main reason I purchased this dress - it works well for that purpose) and am guessing my bra size to be a 36D, and there is no way I would wear this without something underneath. I wear a nursing bra that looks like a v-neck undershirt under it and it covers better that way. Then I pair it with a shrug and it looks nice.

The other issue I have with this design is that it's advertised as being red and white. It is so far from being red. It's pink, almost hot pink. I love the floral pattern and birds and everything else about the design, but I was seriously disappointed with the color and never would have bought it had I known it was pink. I just wear a red shrug over it and that makes the pink stand out less without clashing too much.

Essentially, it's a really nice dress if you know what to expect and work with it a bit. Not sheer (I tried a black bra under it and it did not show through), and very flattering. I actually bought another pattern of this dress a few weeks after buying this one because I liked the fit and design so much.",6040972467
"I am very pleased with this dress! I wasn't sure what size to get when I ordered it, so I got an XL (I'm about 5'7"" and weigh 210lbs). I was pleased to see that this has smocking in the back which gives it a bit of stretch. It is very comfortable, and is exactly the look I was going for. I will probably buy a couple more dresses from this brand, although I may go down a size as I am in the process of losing weight and would like to be able to keep wearing them.
I added a picture of the back of the dress, one without a petticoat, and the last picture is the dress with a petticoat. I bought ""Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt Petticoat White(L)"" on Amazon to go with this dress. Please note that as this dress is cut to have a big circle skirt it tends to be much more flattering if you do decide to add a petticoat underneath it.",6040972467
"This dress was a little bit big when I received it, however once I washed it
the dress did shrink somewhat . I'm a 10/12 & ordered a large, I think I'd go with a medium next time as it has a stretchy panel in the back. I did get lots of compliments on it.",6040972467
Pretty dress. The size was right on.,6040972467
Nice summer dress. Elastic gathered back makes is an easy fitting dress. Not tight. Adjustable straps are a bonus. The waist area is embroidered and looks beautiful. The pleats are flattering and no too poofy. I'm a 16/18 and the XL fits perfectly. Nice length. Easy to dress up or down.,6040972467
"I returned this dress as it had a little too much pattern for me, and was a little too full.  But it just didn't fit my style.",6040972467
I had to add a lining because it was to shear for my liking but otherwise the dress is beautiful,6040972467
"Cute dress, but they way it was cut, one couldn't wear a bra, so I sent it back.  It would be cute for someone who doesn't need to wear a bra, because the fabric covers well.",6040972467
The dress is completely see through. There is an odd stretching panel in the back that makes other parts of the dress look bulky. I was very disappointed due to the many glowing reviews.,6040972467
It's a super cute dress & very colorful. My only issue is that the top portion does not cover up any cleavage. I have to wear a sports bra or camisole underneath.,6040972467
Looks great on my wife love the fit and makes her look sexy.  Would buy again.  Has to be hand washed is the only thing.,6040972467
"It's a pretty dress, but runs very large.  I normally wear a size 16 and ordered the 16, but it is too baggy in the chest and waist, making me look frumpy.",6040972467
"This dress fit perfect!!  It's more of a hot pink in person than it appears online.  I did not mind, however.",6040972467

 Pistachio Women's Sun Flower Flowing Knee Length Summer Dress Medium (Us 8-10) Pink    from Deborah A Fonce on May 18, 2016

Beautiful dress

Beautifully made dress. Can't wait for warmer weather so I can wear it. Fits perfect.",6040972467
Very nice bought and the best experience,6040972467
"The pattern on the dress is as vibrant as the picture. The material is extremely comfortable. I really love the back of the dress, as I hate having to constantly zip up dresses. This is a simple pull over. It does a very nice job of highlighting your chest and flowing out enough to cover anything that you don't want to show. It was interesting to me that you order in numeric sizes, however, the dress itself comes in the standard S,M,L formats. I have purchased additional dresses from Pistachio of this style because of how flattering and comfortable this dress is.",6040972467
The sizes are confusing. I wear a medium and this was huge!,6040972467
Very cute. A little more clevage is revealed than I would like but I simply wear a tank top under it.,6040972467
"VERY CUTE DRESS, GOOD QUALITY, WORTH THE MONEY",6040972467
nice dress but didn't fit me well,6040972467
"I like the design more than I thought I would. I was afraid it would be too busy, but it's not.",6040972467
Very cute but one of the straps broke the first time I wore it!,6040972467
Love the dress!! It's looks really nice and perfect for a summer day! Will order the other colors!,6040972467
"I love this dress, it's beautiful and fits as expected.",6040972467
it cool but you better get a size larger than what you usually wear,6040597410
"My wife is pleased with the Bolero.  It is a bit plain, but that is why we purchased it, so she could dress it up with her own accessories.",6040597410
Cheap looks too cheap do not buy. I return it and didn't receive anything back,6040596368
"This was such a beautiful piece. I've worn it on several occasions to dressy events over the last few weeks. I have had numerous, numerous complements.
You asked about the fit. It was a perfect fit for me.  I would have normally bought a size large  in USA I am a 1214. But, I bought an extra large in the UK size and it fit like the USA large. The only negative thing I can say about this piece, were the sleeves were a little long, but I was able to hem them. The jacket fits like a glove.",6040596368
Very pretty!! True to size.  Jacket isn't real heavy but it will be good for over my wedding dress!,6040596368
Beautiful and nicely made jacket was perfect for my daughter's winter wedding.  Really quite lovely.,6040596368
"I bought this to wear with my wedding dress and it looked elegant.  I think I will be able to wear it with other outfits, as well.",6040596368
"If fit, came in a timely manor but it didn't have the lines/stripes on it like the picture showed but still it worked and suited its purpose",6040596368
"I just receive this in the mail, very disappointed with the product.....it's was to go with my wedding dress but I have to return it . Definitely not mink looking... what a joke !!! Please don't buy ,not the product in the picture .",6040596368
Was an okay but...no front clasp and material a bit cheap looking.  Wore over a Christmas dress with red and looked cute but shed all over husbands black suit!  Not fancy enough for a wedding.  Did come on a hanger with a bag in excellent condition.  Material looks more lush or real in pic than in real life,6040596368
"Perfect coat for my winter wedding!! Can't wait to wear it next month. It fits true to size, it's warm and it looks great.",6040596368
"Fits very well.  I like that the arms are long enough for someone that is 5'10""",6040596368
"I was surprised as after I ordered this jacket I realized that their 3 x was considered a US size 14...I ordered it in June, and it arrived on August 8th..It FIT and I'm not a size 14..More like an 18...",6040596368
"I purchased this item to go with my formal strapless gown for an event that will be outside first weekend of September just in case I get cold in the evening. It fits well the sleeves are a tad long but, not enough to to bother me. It feels good. It also came with a hanger. Over all a great purchase.",6040596368
"Shorts seen good, fit the waist fine. Guys with muscular thighs like mine order order larger size.",6342506256
Tyt as set of jeans if Baggy is your estilo definitely get yourself a pair of these definitely worth the +$40 n the fabric is comfortable aswell so it's a win win.,6342509379
Pants are comfy & look nice.  Front pockets are made of fabric so thin your keys will tear right through.,6342509379
Way too small and no side pocket...the entire reason I ordered these,6342520577
Let me first say I really don't have a butt to be wearing these. They fall right off. I did read the reviews so I ordered accordingly. Not a big deal. I guess Value Village gets them.,6342520577
Doesn't stay up..way to big in waist!,6342520577
Not good for running.  Falls off,6342520577
It's made for a tall female with breast smaller than ddd,6342522545
"Its really cute but doesn't have the peach color on it like it shows in the photo. But other then that its really cute , just a bit confusing trying to put it on.",6342522545
Nothing like the picture! It's just plain black! But it fit me perfect!,6342522545
"I was told they run small, so I ordered a larger size. Perfect!",6342522545
Does not look like the product and doesn't fit too well,6342522545
"Too big, passed it on as a gift with great review!!!",6342522898
"its not purple its a hot pink, but i like it! was long so i cut it shorter and i cut the top string so i can tighten it on my little boobies haha",6342522898
Does what its supposed to. Too short though.,6342523002
"Its a complete joke. Do not even consider buying this dress. Its crazy long.. and I mean really really long and the top part is not even constructed like in the picture. Your boobs are completely exposed because the front pieces are sewn too close together and no way of coverage. The fabric is extremely stiff and scratchy because the glitter is glued on. Oh boy.. junk junk junk. To top things off, there is no return option unless you pay for it yourself. Sooo... yeah.",6319781610
If you live in a cold winter zone these are perfect. My husband loves them. He works in construction and was warm all day. I ordered more for him.,6342502943
"My husband says that they very comfortable and warm.  The only thing that do not work properly are the zippers.  The zippers are hard to move up and down and the buttonholes are very tight, but I will buy them again.  They look very nice.",6342502943
Fits right but the craftsmanship is very laking  They started to fall apart within a month of wearing them very sad because they were super comfy.,6342502943
The fabric is soft and would be very comfortable if they fit.  I usually wear size 38 jeans. I ordered size 40 and they are still very snug.,6342502943
Love it all worked out real good.,6342502943
"Beautiful outfit! I was super sized to get it in the mail. Good quality. I have a long waist, so unfortunately it didn't fit me length wise, but it was beautiful!",6342522723
Horrible! I hate when these companies TAKE pictures or designs from high quality lingerie and give you quick cheap ugly knock off,6342522723
I LOVE IT!!! Super sexy and it arrived quicker than expected!!!,6342522723
Love this product and fits very well suitable.,6318962387
"Midwestern's dream. Pant's feel nice & heavy,LOT'S of pocket's to loose your item's in & warm!",6342503508
Kind a small to be a (M) size. Colors and quality are great!!,6665559742
Quality shirt and screen print. I wear XL most of the time but some XL tee shirts are a little snug so I got the 2X just to be safe and it isn't any too big. Logo is not quite centered on shirt is my only complaint but not enough for people to notice plus I have run into that issue quite often on screen print shirts its seems difficult for companies to get the print centered.,6665559939
"Sweet shirt, fits great, excellent quality!",6665559939
Very nice graphics on a durable material. Loved it more in person.,6665559939
Ordered an xl but usually wear a large. great fit.  nice graphics.,6665559939
Purchased as a birthday gift...he really liked it.,6665559769
"Way too small, not able to wear it. Really bummed",6665559769
Bought it for my husband he loves it!,6665559769
Great product. Gilddan shirt is awesome. Doesn't shrink,6665559769
You couldn't even tell what was on shirt! Waste of money!,6665562328
Shirt material seems very durable and is extremely comfortable. Imprint is very sharp and clear.,6665562328
You couldn't even tell what was on shirt! Waste of money!,666556231X
Shirt material seems very durable and is extremely comfortable. Imprint is very sharp and clear.,666556231X
"Good quality, however a bit expensive and small.",6665559734
Perfect shirt. Love it. Fits really nice. Thank you!,6665559750
The shirt fits well and is of good quality material and stitching. I personally think it runs a little small for the size 2xl i ordered so plan accordingly for this shirt. Dan and Amy take pride in what they sell and I am sure they would accommodate any issues you have with your order from Honcho SFX,6665559777
This is such a fun t shirt. It fits just a tad small.,6665559777
I truly appreciate JDress she was able to rush the item to me as promised. It was unfortunate that the dress just did not work out for me. However The seller took care of refunding my purchase very quickly. I definitely recommend this seller to anyone looking to purchase beautiful gowns. Theyre honest and go that extra mile to help in anyway they can. Thank you again.,7304678828
Item seems to be pretty good quality but did take some time to get here.,7709260446
Ordered a 7-8 but a larger size was sent with a note and pencil eraser. I ordered the size my child needed.  He'll have to grow into it...maybe in a year because it's very long in the sleeves and torso.,7709260446
Size not coresponding with my request. Too large (11-12) or I need for 9-10.,7709260446
"It has a good led light quality, but not t-shirt, I bought Medium size, but it is too small. :/",7563925643
This product came and fit as advertised.  My son likes it so I am happy with the purchase.,7709260373
The leather is really soft and pliable- perfect for an active toddler!! I want one in this leather for me!!,7709260373
Size not coresponding with my request. Too large (11-12) or I need for 9-10.,7709260373
"This is so cute!  My daughter loves wearing it, and has already recieved many compliments.  The fabric is soft and comfy and has a nice look to it, def not cheap.  Saw some reviews about similar coats with a weird smell, this did not have it.  This is a 3t-4t which is too large but we rollled the sleeves and she will grow into it.",7709260373
"Purchased as a low budget costume for school play, son fell in love and will not take it off! Other Reviews concerned me, but as of yet it's faired well and no disappointments. Nicer than expected.",7709260373
"My son is obsessed with Terminator (6 y/o), so he asked for a leather jacket just like the Terminators. This jacket is the most affordable kid leather jacket I could find, so I was worried about its quality especially ordering online. But I was pleasantly surprised when it came, the quality is great, the fit is just right I think ( my son is a smaller 6y/o,  so I ordered a size down), and it keeps him warm!",7709260373
Arrived just as described! Just what we needed!,7709260373
Great faux leather coat at good price!! Thanks!,7709260373
Nice jacket but the arm lengths are small.,7709260373
Loved the jacket!  We got the 4-5T and the 5-6T. Fits well and feels like leather.,7709260373
I have a tall 10 year old and the 14 fits him just right. I will be too small by next season but it is still really nice. He loves the fur lining too!,7709260373
"Great for the price.  Not real leather but looks like it.  Needed to be ironed first, used towel over top to ensure it didn't burn.  Great product for the price.",7709260373
Really nice jacket however it runs a size smaller so need to purchase the next size up,7709260373
Based on other reviews I ordered a size bigger. This jacket is so soft! My 11 year old daughter loves it. Not very warm but the jacket is thin enough to be worn under a thick winter coat.,7709260373
Zipper broke off jacket after 2 days wearing.  Can we send it back?,7709260373
For the price... this is awesome!,7709260373
"Good quality, fit well, grandson loved it!",7709260373
Got it for my grandson.  It fits well and he loves it!  Can't believe it's even washable.,7709260373
"Bought this for a greaser costume. Was slightly smaller than you would expect for a 11-12yr size. My son is small for 12 and the sleeves just reached in wrists. This worked great for the costume style but not great for every day wear if that's what you are buying it for. Decent quality material and the inside is lined with a soft fur like, off-white material. My son loves it.",7709260373
"I absolutely love this jacket!! My son gets compliments every time he wears it, and his friends are actually jealous of this jacket. I've bought other faux leather products, and they are generally crap. Not this. And the sherpa really adds to the quality. Great coat !!",7709260373
My 4 year old looks so freaking cute in this. We live in So cal so it's just been sitting in his closet but still I love it.,7709260373
This was a nice javket. My son loves it. He wanted on just like my leather jacket.,7709260373
Is a very good item. My son was very happy.,7709260373
"This jacket is Awesome! Picked it up for my grandson and he loves it so much, he never wants to take it off. I read the reviews and saw that people said it ran a little small so, we got a size bigger. That was super helpful. It is is great looking, wonderful quality",7709260373
My grand son don't want to take the jacket off he likes it thanks,7709260373
"Perfect fit and style needed to complete my son's costume for his Jazz dance competition team set.  They are doing a tap routine to the Hand Jive song and he is dressing like a ""greaser"" from the 50's!",7709260373
Okay this is the most darling jacket ever! My son wanted to look like the cool guy on 'Just Add Magic.' He looks so handsome in it. The material is soft and comfortable. It is not a warm jacket however. We pair it with a hoodie as needed for warmth. I would absolutely purchase again.,7709260373
My son loves it can't get him to stop wearing it as it is getting warmer.,7709260373
"This jacket is really cute and my son really likes it. The only problem is that the zipper gets stuck on him almost everytime he wears it, so I can't let him wear it to school which is the whole reason he asked for it for Christmas. There is also nothing to fasten the top silver snaps, so the top just kind of flops around.",7709260373
Cool for a little kid. My daughter loves it. I'm not trying to buy her a real leather jacket!!,7709260373
"Got this for an 8 year old, he absolutely loves it and wears it every day. It looks nice and is holding up to typical 3rd grade boy abuse. It's very lightweight and not warm at all, but looks great over a hoodie.",7709260373
Great quality.  My son has no idea it isn't a genuine leather jacket. Really soft. We both love it!,7709260373
"The jacket I received is not a same as on a picture.
It misses one button on a collar. I'm returning.",7709260373
My grandson really like the jacket.,7709260373
Good quality jacket for the price!,7709260373
Cheap material zipper came off just in one.  Not happy with purchase,7709260373
I loved the quality sizing was off,7709260373
"Bought this for my 10 year old son for christmas. HE wanted to look ""cool"" lol. He is absolutely satisfied with it. He wears it everyday. It is made very well, has a wool like interior, and outside is leather material. So it keeps him super warm too.",7709260373
"Wonderful, well made, sharp jacket. My son loves it and he gets complimented every tume he wears it.
He is 5, but tall for hus age so I bought the 6/7. I have to roll the sleeves once at the cuff, but it is no problem and will fit perfectly next year and probably the year after that too.
Great buy.",7709260373
It was exactly what I was looking for! It's held up very well too.,7709260373
Bought it for 50s day at my sons school. It was a little larger than we thought but it was totally adorable!,7709260373
"Bought it for a Halloween costume
Fits large but worked for my use.
Decent jacket food leather but thin.",7709260373
"This is a great jacket, especially for my new member of a rock band. I was expecting it to be more of a costume but he will definitely be wearing this around town. We ordered the size 5/6 for a very slim 7 yr old and it fits perfectly with a hoodie underneath. He especially likes the fuzzy lining on the inside.",7709260373
My son loves his jacket it's true to size and keeps him warm,7709260373
"Very cute. All manmade materials, but oddly labeled as 100% cotton.",7709260373
The size was too big for my grandson.,7709260373
"Good quality and grandson just loves it!. I ordered a little larger for grow room based on their chart.  It fit perfectly so no grow room. So does run a little small. Overall though, .we are pleased.",7709260373
Great quality and my daughter LOVES it,7709260373
I bought these coats for my little girls because they wanted a coat just like mine.  It was hard finding everywhere else.  When I received it I was impressed at the quality and best of all my girls loved their coats.,7709260373
"My son loves his jacket!!!! Ordered a 9-10 because they run small, he is normally a 7. We got the one with the sherpa lining and glad we did, it is a lot warmer. Be gentle with the zippers, they are not heavy duty. Very nice jacket for the price, my kid never wants to take it off. They do run narrow so order a size up for sure.",7709260373
"Decent quality for the price. A spring or fall cost for the northeast. Zipper is ""orientated"" as if for female.  11 year old son was slightly upset but was eventually okay with it once he realized others did not notice.",7709260373
Just what my son  has been dreaming of! He LOVES it!,7709260373
"Order bigger then your size, they run small. It fits my son just won't be for to long. Kind of a bummer. Lot of money for just a few months of use. Great coat tho he loves it. Looks great",7709260373
My son loves the jacket.  It seems to be of good quality.  The pleather is soft.  I like it a lot.,7709260373
nice little jacket for the money.,7709260373
Bought this to use as a costume for my 9  year old son. Fit perfectly and he looked awesome in it.,7709260373
"My son loves this jacket. He ended a jacket that screamed the 50's. This jacket totally works. The best is great for the quality. I'm not sure how long it will last because it's oviously not real leather, but my son loves it. I went with a bigger size due to other reviews. I'm glad we did.",7709260373
"Looks awesome, was great for what I needed it for, but it's not for long term use.  Spots of the outside rub off easily.  The upper snaps are just for looks.",7709260373
These faux leather jackets are adorable for what we wanted.  Have 5 little boys all under 8 and they all ride dirt bikes and ATV's.  I think they are going to all be excited.  I would order almost 1-2 sizes larger than normal.  Sleeves are what are short and needing larger size.,7709260373
"It was cute while it lasted, but the zipper broke after 2 months. Poor quality.",7709260373
This jacket is awesome! Great price and my son loved it! It also fit as expected.,7709260373
Somewhat large and had to return,7709260373
"Its very nicely made, I got it for my sons costume, and he for sure will be wear it more than ones.",7709260373
My Grandson loves the jacket and wears it often.,7709260373
Worked great for my sons Halloween costume!,7709260373
Item seems to be pretty good quality but did take some time to get here.,7709260373
"My 8yo son is over the moon in love with this jacket.  He won't take it off!
The ""pleather"" is very soft and has the same feel as a genuine lamb skin jacket I own.
It is stylish and well-made.
I got the 7/8 (130) for my son.  He's slim and this fits perfectly.  He can still get a sweater under it for added warmth this season.  It might still fit him next autumn, but I'm pretty sure he won't be able to get a sweater under it at that point.
But for the price, who cares!?!  I'll just buy the next size up when the time comes.
Very happy with this purchase.",7709260373
It's a Christmas present so we don't know yet really.,7709260373
Nothing like the picture. The arms are extremely wide and the zipper doesn't move down. It's extremely thin as well. Ugly.,7709260373
"Beautifully made, great quality however; I found the body to arm proportion was off. The body fit was great but the arm length was a little short for the jacket to be a 14/16. I initially brought it for my 13yr old little brother but ended up having to give it to my 8yr nephew. With that said I cant give it 5 stars due to the shortness of the arms, but other than it was an awesome purchase.",7709260373
"Awesome, it fits as expected and is really comfortable, only problem is that when I touched it, it had a bad smell",7709260373
We got this for my sons birthday as he was longing for a cool black leather jacket. The price is great and the quality also pretty good. The zipper sticks sometimes and seems as though it might not last but so far so good and my son absolutely adores the jacket. He wears it everywhere and gets lots of compliments! Id definitely buy it again.,7709260373
My son loved it and was perfect for his Negan Halloween costume!,7709260373
It is well made.neat sewing and the fitting is ok.,7709260373
Great quality and fits true to size.,7709260373
"My 7 year old loves this jacket and won't take it off.  It is a bit tight in the waist, which makes it difficult for him to zip, but the ""cool"" factor for a kid is all there!",7709260373
Love this Jacket! My son wore it for Halloween as Negan and he is wearing it after and getting lots of compliments!,7709260373
I liked the material and is pretty comfy for my boy but the sleeves were a lil too long.,7709260373
I can't say enough good things about this jacket! We purchased for a Halloween Costume for our son  (the terminator) but this jacket is so well made.  I would suggest ordering up one size. Very very pleased with the quality.,7709260373
Bought for Halloween costume. Sleeve length short for size ordered. Jacket is not roomy but my son is slim. Nice liner. Would by a size up from your child's size. We bought 13-14 which is biggest size they had. Can't beat price but runs small.,7709260373
Good Jacket for my niece. Sleeves were a little long but good buy! would recommend!,7709260373
Grandson is 7 purchased 10 /12 still fits small,7709260373
Was pretty much what I expected for the price but to not have the collar snaps an the snaps to keep it open is not cool. Massively dissatisfied to only see half a snap.,7709260373
"We bought this for my daughter as part of a costume and I was expecting it to be pretty poor-quality because it was quite inexpensive. I was so surprised! This is really fantastic!! We BOTH loved it! It's soft and hip! It seems quite well-made. She looked fabulous in it! It sort of broke my heart to turn it into a costume. We will be buying a second one for regular use because it was such a nice product. We had a little trouble with the zipper, but not enough to change my rating. I thought this was a great buy!",7709260373
Disappointed received a larger size than requested.  I order 9-10 and received a size 11-12.,7709260373
"I bought this for my son for 50s day at school.  He had so much fun.  After school he said -- with a big grin on his face -- ""Everyone kept calling me Elvis!"" I think he might just wear it every day until it gets too cold.  It fits as expected.",7709260373
"It was just what we were looking for..its a thin jacket, no really durable. We were looking for something for my grandsons costume. So it fit our needs.. the fit was perfect. Its not something for real cool weather. Regardless we were happy with it..",7709260373
"Cute jacket, especially for the price! It was said to come by November 4th and I received it on October 24th. Very happy it was early since I needed it for a Halloween costume (Sandy from Grease). My daughter is 3 and fits in most 4T clothes. This jacket was a little big on her for a 3/4T so I think it may run a tad big. Only thing I didn't like about this was that the snaps at the top don't snap to anything. For the price I would definitely recommend this jacket.",7709260373
"My son loves his jacket! Nice looking and fits, but i did get a 10-12 and my boy is 9. The zipper is alittle hard to get up and down sometimes but other than that its pretty nice for the price!",7709260373
We loved it. Fut well great quality,7709260373
"Wrong size was sent, kept it for my daughter to grow into, otherwise it's super cute and incredibly soft and plush on the inside",7709260373
"My 10 yr old loves this jacket! He had it in a smaller size last year but just grew out of it, so asked if I would buy more another one a size bigger! It looks cool and is soft and made to mimic real leather.",7709260373
"Very nice for the price! I had read reviews before I purchased and knew to order a size bigger, so it fits perfect!",7709260373
"Great jacket for the money, my son loves it!!",7709260373
The jacket is of great quality. I was very satisfied with that. They just run a little big.,7709260373
"My son has been asking for a jacket like this since the start of summer, but in Texas? I found this on amazon and decided to take a chance. It is a light weight jacket, but again, well suited to fall and spring in Texas. My son loves it and I don't think Ill be able to get it off him until the weather warms up again. Followed the sizing guide and it fits him well. The zippers slide well, and none of the seems have any loose threads hanging off, so the jacket has a feel of quality.",7709260373
"I am tempted to give this 5 stars. It looks great and even smells like leather. How it holds up over time is the only question but, for the price, I am more than satisfied.",7709260373
It looks amazing. Very cool jacket! My son loves it! Great price for a great jacket!,7709260373
This jacket is so adorable. It fits just the way it should. I was first worried that the sleeves would be too short but nope! Just right. Very reasonably priced. Very thin so don't buy for warmth. I bought a size big so my 6yr old boy could wear a down jacket underneath.,7709260373
fits my son perfectly and he actually likes wearing this,7709260373
5/6 is small for 5/6 YEARS OLD BUT IS CUTE,7709260373
Very good quality. Exactly what we expected.,7709260373
My son loves it. Great value for the price.,7709260373
This jacket is adorable! I got a 7/8 and it fits my 6 year old perfectly.,7709260373
"Very nice children's jacket. Bought it for a girl. Parents really loved it. However, you should know that there are no snaps to keep the corner folds down. My friends opted to buy cute little skull pins to hold it in place. W/o pins, they will just flap.",7709260373
My granddaughter LOVE this jacket!,7709260373
My son is going to be Negan for halloween and this is so perfect! Great quality.,7709260373
Really cute jacket.  Fit my 5 year old perfect,7709260373
"My 9yr old daughter wanted a leather.  No sense of spending the money on a real one at this age so, honestly, this jacket was the next best thing.  She loves the fit and style of it!  Both the stitching and fit are good.  It does not have any kind of weird smell to it either, which I thought I read.  I believe I bought a size up (L), just because I want her to try and use it for 2 years.",7709260373
Looked great for my son's Ghost Rider Cosplay!! He loves it!,7709260373
Love it! Super soft and looks just like our (mom and dad) motorcycle jackets!,7709260373
"I ordered it a little bigger and it fit perfectly. Great jacket, made very well and so smooth, my grandson loves it!",7709260373
Pretty nice jacket but it has no liner so it is just a layer of leather. Not sure how warm it'll actually be but a sweatshirt under it should do the trick. Kid loves it so I'm a happy customer.,7709260373
Very cool jacket. Buy two sizes up if you want your kid to be able to wear it. Appears to be pleather.,7709260373
Looks nice but not as well made as I had hoped for .. my son only worn it a few times before the lining started coming apart.,7709260373
"Completely false description! This jacket is not leather, in fact it isn't the only thing fake, the snaps are faux too, why put fake snaps on a jacket? My son tried it on, asked ""what the snaps did"", and after noticing they did nothing, I replied, ""gave you a false sense of trust..."" Return started with an unhappy dad and 5 year old.",7709260373
My grandchild loved the jacket.  It is light weight so he can wear it during the fall and cool summer days.  An excellent product.,7709260373
Adorable! Better than expected! Soft and beautifully made.,7709260373
Fits my son but a little small..definitely will not be able to wear a hoodie with it. Quality was ok. Could have been a little heavier but for the price it was ok.,7709260373
"Got this for my daughter to wear for daddy/daughter dance performance. Even though it is technically made for boys, it looked so cute on her and fit her nicely. She loves it and wears it all the time!",7709260373
Excellent qyaluty of leather. It is a little bit small for my 10 years old son.,7709260373
could not be any better! got it as a gift for a nephew that loves johnny from sing. looks amazing on him and fits well. went a size up so he could wear it in the future. quality is top notch for the price and will keep him warm in the winter. thank you!! it was is favorite gift,7709260373
Great jacket! It fit my average size 7 year old perfect and he loves it. Insists on wearing it everyday!,7709260373
"My son has been wearing this jacket even though it's 85+ degrees outside because he loves it so much. He is a tall, long-armed, solid 10 year old and the T13-14 size just barely fits.  I doubt that he will be able to wear it for more than a few of months.  The leather is soft and the jacket is lightweight.",7709260373
"Son loves his jacket. Fits well, very stylish and well made for the price.",7709260373
"It says ""Children's Collar Motorcycle Leather Coat""... I guess the operative word here would be 'leather'. It's not.",7709260373
"I ordered this for a boy's 7th birthday. The fit was absolutely perfect! It was just large enough to grow a little bit, or to layer warm clothes underneath. The jacket looks great, and when he got it, he refused to take it off, even on a summer day in a warm movie theater. I was concerned after reading some of the reviews, but could not have been happier with both the fit and the look, feel, even the smell (there was none) of the jacket.",7709260373
Super cute and quality looks good!,7709260373
"Nice style and fit. My son likes the jacket. But your listing says twice that it is made of leather, and it is clearly NOT. It is fraud--or at least bait and switch--to misrepresent an item in this way. Then, the tag inside gives washing instructions that I cannot believe because it says that the jacket is 100% COTTON.",7709260373
"Grandson Loved it! Perfect for the play he was in! Had a slight smell, but after airing out it was ok!",7709260373
Loved this...fast shipment and fit perfect,7709260373
My grandson lives Rock music. He loved this jacket,7709260373
"Seriously?! I can not believe how amazing this jacket is! And if this is faux leather well then they certainly fooled me because it feels and smells very real! Perfect fit, fully lined, amazing and my son absolutely loves it!",7709260373
"My son and I love the jacket and are pleased with the purchase.  My son is a size 8 and based on the reviews we read before ordering about it running small, we ordered a 9/10.  It is a little big which is what I wanted since it will be 3 or 4 months before he really starts wearing it but it's not too big for him to wear now and he is wearing it proudly.

Thank you for a great value!",7709260373
"Perfect sizing. Came as expected. Nice fur lining on the back. Even though it's not real leather, it looks like it.",7709260373
My nephew loved the jacket and he looked great in it,7709260373
I like the material but it's somewhat small,7709260373
"This jacket is perfect and my 9 year old son adores it. The material is soft but has held up to his rambunctious ways so far. He wears it every chance he gets. The color is true and size was spot on.

The only negative I can say about this at all is that the outer flap at the top doesn't secure to anything so it just kind of flops there. It is certainly not an issue for him though.",7709260373
Cheap material. Very thin and too big for the size they said to go up to.,7709260373
too small and got lost in mail on return- no refund either.,7709260373
"perfect fit for 8 year old, who normally wears 6/7. bought a 7/8. so soft.",7709260373
"My son is very picky and didn't end up liking it but as far as quality and accuracy- 5 stars!! The leather feels very nice, the size was perfect, and it looks exactly like it does in the picture.",7709260373
This little jacket is true to size so cute! And I love the little fur on the inside! I even added my own fur around the collar ,7709260373
My son really loves leather jackets. I found this one on Amazon and decided to purchase for him. It arrived and I'm pleased with the product especially for the price.,7709260373
My son is 10 in a 8/10 but they are getting snug so I ordered up. It fit perfect and he loved it. It looked great for 50's day at school.,7709260373
"We sent our 6 year old great-nephew this jacket for his birthday last month. He has, reportedly, shown it off to everyone he meets. Clearly it makes this little guy feel pretty cool! It's so well made it should last long enough for his little brother to have a turn strutting his stuff in it after another year or two. Very good looking and worth the price.",7709260373
"I didn't know the leather jacket had fur in the inside, (which I dislike). But that didn't stop me from designing it to be a bad ass race car jacket for my sons 3rd birthday!",7709260373
Good quality for man made leather. Order size up.,7709260373
Very nice. Arrived fast and fit great!,7709260373
I like this jacket is a gift for my broter I love this jacket ,7709260373
I love this jacket and so does my 4 year old son! It is very soft and he has plenty of room to grow!,7709260373
"Received early. haven't worn yet, don't know how will up after extended wear; but appears in shape soft to touch and flexible, easy to move in. So far is good product.",7709260373
grandson wore it to his class sock-hop,7709260373
It runs a little small but nice overall,7709260373
"Love it! But the closures for the buttons were not on the jacket. Using it for a dance costume and had to buy velcro yo hold the collars down. Otherwise, love the feel of it and my son loves the style!!",7709260373
"Very nice, son loves it. As parent I wish it had been a bit thicker specially the sleeves. The pockets has zippers which is not only practical and nice look but opening very small!",7709260373
"Looks great, tough as nails. Note that the front of it has a lot of material; at least four thick layers without the lining on, so it isn't a fashiony moto jacket, but it does look badass cinched in with a pair of black Dingo boots and skinny jeans. There is literally enough room in the inner pockets for two heavy pistols.",7709260373
I ordered a 10 for my son. Way to small. Looks like toddler size. Sent back.,7709260373
"fabric feels a bit cheeper then expected, but my daughter loves it and it fits just right.",7709260373
Great quality.  Looks good.  Purchased for my 8 year old son. I followed previous reviews & ordered one size larger & it fits well with a bit of room to grow.,7709260373
"The quality of this jacket is wonderful for the price. I was worried it would be too small for my five year old son, who isn't chunky but definitely has a little belly. A lot of reviews said they got sent the next biggest size, but that was not the case for me. Luckily it fit him just fine, probably will grow out of it pretty quickly but it'll last through jacket weather this year. There's enough room to wear a hoodie underneath, with the jacket unzipped. He loves it, and was prancing around looking in the mirror at how cool he is wearing it, lol! I will definitely buy this again when he needs a bigger one!",7709260373
It's a thin leather but flexible.  He loves it.  Perfect fit for him but he is tall and thin. Still room for a heave sweater.,7709260373
"It fit him a little large, but that is the issue I have with all of his clothes ... that jacket looks real nice",7709260373
Fun for my 9 year old grandson.,7709260373
My 13 year old grandson loved this!!! The leather was soft and fit was right on!  I got the 14.....thank you.,7709260373
"8 year old grandson loves this jacket. It was purchased to accompany his motor bike, helmet & goggles. He looked super cool and insisted on riding it in Houston's 78 degree weather. Just needed that biker look!!!!",7709260373
Jacket fit perfect and looks great!! My son is a small 10 year old and I ordered him a 9-10. The seller sent a nice email letting me know the jacket was on the way.,7709260373
Ordered a 7-8 but a larger size was sent with a note and pencil eraser. I ordered the size my child needed.  He'll have to grow into it...maybe in a year because it's very long in the sleeves and torso.,7709260373
Not as heavy as an adult leather but still super cute,7709260373
"Fit was good for my 10 year old son. Very thin. If your buying for warmth, I would not suggest this coat. Very nice product though.",7709260373
This is  perfect for a child... my little man is going to love it .... I added Harley patches on like his Granddad...,7709260373
"Inexpensive, but very cheaply made plasticy jacket",7709260373
Awesome product. High quality at a phenomenal price.,7709260373
"The jacket arrived within two weeks and that was a pleasant surprise as it wasn't expected for six weeks. Soft leather, great fit. Only thing I didn't like is the snaps for the collar/lapel had nowhere to snap to, so it just kinda hangs. I will have to sew some snap ins in myself.",7709260373
"The tag on the jacket is Zara Kids. My son bought it for a Halloween costume, but he wears it every day. It actually looks really great.",7709260373
Great kid's jacket for the price. I used some metallic silver paint and made a Quicksilver (X Men) Halloween costume for my son.,7709260373
Item arrived in about 2 weeks. Soft leather. Nice quality. My son loves it. Ordered a size up and it fits perfectly.,7709260373
"Like everyone here has said, it runs small.  I went up a size, and still needed to make a return for a larger one.  That being said, the exchange was super easy, and that jacket itself is absolutely fabulous!!  Love it, and I am excited to give it to my son for Christmas!  :-)",7709260373
My son was baby Negan for halloween.  This jacket is great for the price!,7709260373
This is a really nice jacket!  I don't know if it is real leather but it is really soft!,7709260373
"Poor - very Bad quality. I cant believe my 7 year old can actually ""hate"" a jacket (he LOVES clothes)... Whatever this material is - it is anything but leather. I also ordered a size larger as it was suggested it runs ""small'. Well, they sent it a size even larger than the larger one I ordered. If I went one more up - I could have worn it myself instead of my kid",7709260373
Great fit. Grandson over joyed.,7709260373
"Awesome jacket, I got it for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. She gets tons of compliments.",7709260373
This is an amazing jacket it looks great on my son. Received it in 2 days. Absolutely love it definitely will buy some seller again,7709260373
Did not even expect it to be to small as I ordered too sizes bigger,7709260373
"Love this jacket!! Exceeded my expectations. Soft, lightweight and modern fit. What I like most is that the fit is sleek and not boxy yet still have room to grow or pair with a sweater. Ordered a 5/6 and received a size 5/6. My son is slim, age 5 and a half and wears Carters size 4 and Old Navy size 5 tops and bottoms.",7709260373
Looks good. Leather is really soft and nice.,7709260373
"This product is a great quality product. Nice soft leather, and silk lining. If you purchase according to the size chart, the sizes are true to those measurements. But they run small if you are buying just based on the size. I purchased a 12-14 which is the largest size available, and it was too small for my average size 10 year old son. The length of the sleeves and body are ok but it is too narrow around the chest",7709260373
"Very nice jacket, I bought it for my 5 yo son, he is an avid ATV rider and he wanted a leather jacket like daddy's! He so cool now lol",7709260373
My daughter loves this for going on the motorcycle with her dad!  It is very soft and thin but it's a nice jacket.  Great for the price!,7709260373
This jacket is so soft. It fits perfect on my son. I read the sizings were off... But I got his size and it's perfect!,7709260373
It's a nice quality stitching.  Soft and looks adorable on my son :)!  I ordered a 7/8 according to the measurements and I should have ordered a 5/6.  But still nice and will last a while.,7709260373
Exactly what I expected. Very pleased with jacket,7709260373
"Ordered a 7/8 as per the sizing guide. They sent a 9/10, which is the perfect fit. Niece is 6 yrs old and is just starting to wear a 7/8 in clothes.",7709260373
My son loves this jacket. So glad I purchased.,7709260373
I bought size 3t4t for a 2 year old and he's tiny and it fits fine,7709260373
"I purchased this for my 9 yr old son for his 50's school musical. He loved the jacket and looks quite dashing! Great fit, great price!",7709260373
Fits great on my 9 year old. Wears it all the time.,7709260373
"Was not happy with the quality, very thin. My grandson wore it and the jacket was snagged on a branch and  ripped the jacket on the very first wear. Not durable at all.",7709260373
"This is great quality but the sizing is way off. I have a scrawny 8 yr old boy and I ordered the size 9/10, thinking itd be a little big and hed grow into it. Thats not the case. The size 9/10 is equal to a size 6/7. Go two sizes up if you buy this item.",7709260373
"Love the style and my son looks dapper :). He is very happy. Doesnt feel warm but thats not what we were after. Glad we found a summer jacket for him (he likes to have a jacket all year round, its a sensory thing).",7709260373
I ordered 1 size bigger for my 8 year old and its perfect. Its not smelly like a lot of cheap pleather. Its just right for a kid who wants to look cool. Great quality for the price.,7709260373
Got this for our son to wear as Negan in our TWD pregnancy announcement. It was spot on. And he loves to wear it now.,7709260373
"Bought this leather jacket for my 8 year old for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. Its a light jacket, best for Spring/Falll, but he wore it a lot even during our nasty New York winter with a t-shirt and hoodie under it. Its held up well over the last 4 months of use and he gets compliments on it constantly. I read that some had issues with the size being accurate, but my son is small for his age, so we didn't have any problems.",7709260373
"Its very well made and exactly like the picture
Goes great for my metro cosplay im working on",8196608373
"Don't waste your money, this XL size will fit a 5 years old girl, china people need to know that American women are robust and not flat like oriental woman.",819809055X
"I'm 5'4"" and hover around 112 lbs, and ordered an XXS - it fits perfectly! I like my clothes to be form fitting and this almost feels like it was made for me. The material is wonderful and it's exactly what I was looking for!",819807905X
I love this blazer. It is made very well and it fit as expected.,819807905X
Super cute! I wasn't sure what to expected. But this is really adorable.,819807905X
This blazer is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! The material is a beautiful soft velvet that conforms to the body. And the price is very reasonable! Ill buy from this seller again and highly recommend them.,819807905X
Great material . Fit is awkward. I had it talored which cost 5x what I paid..,819807905X
Item arrived today8-21-17. So way quicker than expected date. It fits good. It is a fitted style jacket. It's comfortable. I like it.,819807905X
NICE BUT BOUGHT XTRA LARGR AND IS WAY TO SMALL I AM 5-11 195,8198126856
Size is a huge challenge with anything that comes from China. It was way too tight. It is also very heavy. I can't return it to China so will have to donate.,8198768831
The body is larger than expected. The arms are the only part that are tight on me.,8198157220
I give this 4 stars.  Had to return because it was too small even after ordering a size up.  Now that I ordered yet another size up I'm quite pleased with it.  Haven't washed it yet though,8198157220
"shown as described, stretchable, soft",819882684X
"Very warm and cute ! I love how it looks ,but fits a little too small unfortunately ...I bought 5xl and fits like 2xl. The seller is great and very easy to work with ! Very sattisfied with the transactin.",8198936181
From the picture I got the feeling it was more like a sweater but the man body of it is jersey material.  It's nice though -  sleeves are very cool.  Good price,8199928794
Top quality material!!! Its now one of my fave fave jacket! Very good material and color looks great! Very fancy and for the price I paid its awesome! Looks better than i thought. Will but again,8200716899
Very good quality but very narrow fitted.,8196764057
"Not sure what to say about this dress since I normally wear a Medium and when I got it, it fit like an XL. When it arrived I was swimming in it. The quality of the fabric seems ok. It is a bit see through but that's a given with white. Stick with your true size on this dress.",8201057988
My niece loves it and ended up taking it; but I bought it for myself. I wish they made XXL of this trench coat,8200813800
"Horrible-- the Yukata seams started to come apart after the 1st washing.  In addition, the fabric is rather course. I have had many Yukatas over the years and have enjoyed them all. Don't buy this one.",9622084168
Fit and material is absolutely perfect.. I love it !!,9622084168

"I ordered this hoodie, and the hoodie that arrived said Im not yelling, Im Italian. Enough said.",9887068187
"I bought this game with high expectations.  I love a good shoot 'em up, but most of these kinds of games take themselves so seriously.  So this one  had such promise.  I especially looked forward to melting the enemy with  the flamethrower (and being melted a time or two myself...).
But this  game quickly grew extremely frustrating.  To start with, the graphics were  flat, with no depth perception at all.  It's very tough to see enemies off  on the horizon, and even tougher to be sure what/where you're aiming.  The  controls are next to impossible to use.  After what I thought was a more  than reasonable several hours of play, by which time I've usually got the  'feel' of a game down, I was still cursing at the screen and tossing the  controller down.  Moving is a challenge - it seemed like I was always  tumbling into a minefield or into the path of machine gun fire that I knew,  from experience, was coming, but I *still* couldn't get the game to let me  move where I wanted to.
I eventually finished (never let a machine beat  you.....), but grudgingly, and by the end I couldn't believe that so many  sequels to this thing have come out.  I certainly won't be buying any of  them.",B00000INRB
"This game has a one player and a two player option. I like the two player mode best. I will describe it first. There are 5 different battle grounds to fight over and the graphics are great, the format is capture the flag, along the way you will find weapons such as bazooka, mortar, grenades,  automatic rife, flamethrower, tanks, .50 caliber machine gun and mines. You  will also get men to assign for defence or attack. If you have a buddy at  the same skill level the game is so addictive that it's hard to stop  playing. The are super sound effects (check out the death scream!) and you  can turn off the music to make it more realistic. The one player game is  fun and challenging it be sure but nothing like laying an ambush for your  co-player in the two player mode. Chase him into a mine field and stand  back. The one player mode has several different missions that reqiure  different tasks to be completed (such as blowing up a bridge and a radio  tower) as well as having to mow down hordes of plastic commies. At this price you  cannot go wrong, this is a good game, easy controls and quick load times.",B00000INRB
"Disk's in perfect shape thought the case is... screwed, but I really don't care about that. I'm sure the item was in ""Very Good"" condition anyway, so it doesn't matter. Love the fact that the disk's in perfect shape though, thank you!",B00000INRB
"After playing Sarge's Heroes on the N64, at a friend's birthday party, that is the game I wanted for Christmas.  When Christmas came, I recieved this game.  Intially, I was disappointed, but I soon fell in love.

What I love about the game was the grittiness to it.  It has a bit more reality to it.  It doesn't hold up well 12 years later, but my nostalgia goggles are in full force.

I recently booted the game up and I found it as frustratingly hard as it ever was.  Its almost borderline broken in spots, in all honesty.  But I still love it.  You can pick it up for cheap, so you have nothing to lose.",B00000INRB
"i love the army men series and this on is the best great graphics great story and great gameplay single player is great and never gets old multie player is the best in multie player mode its capture the flag one player plays as the green and the other plays as the tan both players place troops to guard the flag while the players try to take the flag and bring it back to their base

get this game its a clasic and a blast to play",B00000INRB
"This is the first army men game i played and it is still really fun. The controls do not take that long to get used to so therefore you don't have to go to boot camp if you have played one of these before but i would still reccomend it. The missions are really fun to do because some can be challenging but some are not that hard but it takes some time to beat so there you have a challenge. After you beat the missions it is very fun to play multiplayer because there are many places to go to and you get to set your guys wherever you want on your territory. They cannot move but they protect your opponent from getting your flag on capture the flag. Thats what the object is to get your opponents flag and bring it back to your base without dying and if you do, the flag goes back to the other base and you start over, whoever brings the flag back first wins. Pretty simple and fun as you dominate your friends and their guards that don't move haha... There are many places to battle at, but of corse they are not very real because it is plastic army men in like rooms with blocks or in backyards. The graphics are good for the ps1 and for plastic army men. I still love to play it and like every other old classic game, it brings back memories....This is an awesome game.",B00000INRB
"I ordered this game just because it was cheap a few days ago.  Well when it arrived, i didn't think much of it and just layed it aside to do later.  When i finally got around to it, i thought it was horrible.  I cursed at the horrible controls, single-stick setup, and simplistic play.  Who'd have thought that 10 minutes later i'd be loving it.  At first it seems that the duck, roll, and aim features were just slapped on features added becasue every other game has them.  But after i died once on the first level i realized how sophisticated this game really is.  You have to learn how to use these things.  The levels have cover spread out at perfect spots, near enemy soldiers.  The typical way of atttack is run up to the cover, duck behind it, roll out, shoot, roll back in.  Still, you can put these in any order that you want, or just forget the cover and do fancy rolling to dodge bullets while charging the enemy.  But be warned: this game can get HARD! especially on any other setting besides easy.  Overall, this game is worth buying.  Even if the story is too simple and you don't really understand why you are doing the objectives (why do i have to get to the west end of town??), this is a great game to play in your spare time (its not the kind of game you'll really get into.  But its still fun).  BUY IT!!",B00000INRB
I ordered it as a filler gift to be honest because it was 9.99 at the time.  My mother was getting him some army man stuff and so I thought this would go along with that.  It ended up being one of his favorite gifts lol... I spent over 100 for an air hockey table and he likes this 10.00 playstation game more.. lol.,B00000INRB
"This will be short, the game is fun but I think personally if you don't have any cheats codes or a game shark the game would be extremly hard and frustrating.",B00000INRB
"This game is a get game if you like army games with guns and action. The fun goes on and on, I personaly prefer muti-player prefence but 1 player is still awesome. It is a good game for kids and a fun one too as i have said before. It is action pack and full of adventers.",B00000INRB
"This game is a total BLAST!! Shoot some Tan's, lay some mines, squish 'em with your tank, chuck a few gernades, play sevaral differnt terrains, and just have fun. Army Men 3D has great animation. You have a awesome 3rd person view with great grahics and lot of weapons. Mutiplayer is so much fun. I don't think that there is a downside to any part of the game. If you have Playsation this sould be the first game you buy!! Have fun.",B00000INRB
"Works perfectly and as expected. Since I've recently bought another psx game hoping on building my collection, here's a PSA. Buy used. If you want the case and everything included, buy them separately or look for someone selling it complete. I wouldn't be writing this on another games review if I didn't think it wouldn't be necessary. If you buy a game off Amazon from the ps1 era and its a good price new, chances are you might get a pirated copy. It happened to me and I want everyone else to make sure they don't get screwed over. Check the reviews before buying and make sure the seller is reputable. Though I'm not saying it will happen every time, just be on the look out. Make sure the back of disc is the right color and make sure the front of the disc has the right logos, pictures and etc. That is all. Happy shopping.",B00000INRB
"item shows it coming with cover and artwork and it did not. poor description, buyer beware",B00000INRB
"Simple, yet challenging gameplay. This one makes for entertainment without compare!",B00000INRB
Game was broken when it arrived. Very disappointing.,B00000INRB
okay for a short person but it needs to be larger to be really good.,B00002N7X0
It looks great in the picture but once we received it we realized it would fit a 5 year old perfectly but not an adult.,B00002N7X0
Baby size and it ain't very good cotton.,B00002N7X0
"I am of medium height, but this apron perches on the upper half of my chest like a tiny clown bib, leaving the rest of my clothes at the mercy of whatever I'm working on.

As bibs go, however, it's nice and sturdy and the pockets are handy.  This would be absolutely perfect as a child's apron.",B00002N7X0
"I love these things. We use them in our factory everyday. they are light and easy on the neck. just right for screws, bits and small tools etc... highly recommended. last for over a year with normal use.",B00002N7X0
I like the pockets. Shrinks a lot. Needs ironing every time  you wash. Runs really small for men .. ..,B00002N7X0
"I thought I was buying a full-sized apron, and could not find dimensions for the item on the website.  The aprons are very short, so not very effective as aprons.  I suppose I was supposed to know that ""utility"" meant something other than ""kitchen.""  My bad.  The apron otherwise is of good quality.",B00002N7X0
"The other reviewers are right, these aprons are on the small side... I took that into consideration when I bought a couple for my kids when they're helping me tool around in the shop.  Had to tie a knot in the neck strap for my 6 year old, but they worked great for them.  So, they work for what I bought them for.",B00002N7X0
The apron bibb ordered was ridiculously small.  Sized for a 3 year old.  The description did not include the size.  I assumed being listed with tools for adults that the apron would be sized for adults.  Customers...don't assume anything!,B00002N7X0
"This summary of Africa's music obviously has to include a huge variety of music from the continent, and it does. It's mostly because African music is not my favorite that the rating is not higher. There are styles to be expected, like Senegalian pop from Youssou N'Dour, Congolese soukous, (which on this album sunds sad rather than happy), and a great track from Nigeria, Abami, which is a fusion of ""Afro-pop, Afro-beat and Afro-jazz,"" and rolls along in an adictive way. But this album also includes a lot of side trips to other African styles you don't usually hear, including Arabic tracks from Morocco and Algeria; Arabesque from Aisha Kandisha's Jarring Effects, and Bellemou, who contributes a catchy song in the Algerian rai style. There's also great Latin-sounding Portuguese music from Cape Verde, a French-language song from Madagascar, and soulful South African reggae (Lucky Dube's Prisoner, with its powerful lyrics). There's also some traditional music, as well as a very westernized jazz track. There's a very beautiful song from Guinea, and a slow, sad song about Aids. Much of this album is really made for dancing. Some of the songs I like very much, and others I don't appreciate as much. Some of the proceeds go to helping Oxfam and its wonderful work worldwide, which is great.",B00005NBV6
"It's not bad. I'm new to African music, but I was hoping to find some stuff from Mali, Kenya, Ethiopia or Tanzania here - and there's nothing from there. There's a lot from southern Africa; two tracks from Mozambique, two from South Africa, and stuff from Madagascar, Zimbabwe and the Congo. Interesting tracks from Morocco (electronic Arabesque) and Algeria (Spanish inflected rai).

In general, though, there's a definite pop or modern sound to ALL of the music here. I was hoping to get more traditional African music in what's supposed to be an overview of African music. The unauthentic jazz track from Ibrahim Abdullah (South Africa) really irritated me, and the English language reggae track from Lucky Dube didn't really sound African. Tito Paris track from Cape Verde almost sounded like an excuse to slip Latin music into an African compilation. Though it sounds like cliche, I had hoped to get the feel of the elephants, Maasai, rhinos and national parks that is really Africa.

The enhanced portion of the CD was very enlightening, showing how Oxfam helps in Africa. Perhaps I'm being too harsh to a release whose sale goes to charity. But it was a short CD in length, and they could have replaced the jazz track with some music from Mali.

Some people will love this CD I'm sure, but I liked only half or more of it. Still, it's not too bad",B00005NBV6
"I bought this CD before hearing a note of it first.  I rarely do that but I have no regrets in this case. From Cristina Branco's opening plucky tune right through this CD is a masterful trip through Europe, leaving no corner of the continent unturned.  From the Baltic to the Balkans, Ireland to Russia this CD covers it all.  I would love to pick out some highlights to talk about specifically, but each tune is a gem.  Randomly I'll choose a few.  Dilele by Angelite/Fanfare Ciocarlia is an uptempo blend of folk music from two very different Balkan countries.  The blend of Romanian and Bulgarian styles is astoundingly beautiful. Eliza McCarthy's 10,000 miles is an uplifting contemporary folk song from Britain that'll make you hum along after the first couple listens.  Arapiko Louloudi by Eleftheria Arvanitaki will make you feel like you're sitting in a Mediterranian cafe sipping retzina.  Besides being packed with great tunes, this CD helps support Amensty International with each purchase.  A great cause and great tunes in one!  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!  Buy this CD!",B00005NBV6
"Throughout Russia, the Balkans, Iberia, Scandanavia, the Central Powers and the Celtic and English isles, innumerable artists are rediscovering or reinventing the acoustic music traditions of Europe.  This collection is an acoustic folkie's wet dream, with kooky tunes galore, sung in all those funny languages they have over there.  Features plenty of heavy hitters such as Christina Branco, one of the up-and-coming stars of Portuguese fado, Hungarian folklorists Marta Sebestyen and Muzsikas, Gabriel Yacoub of France, Celt/Brit stars Eliza Carthy and Altan, along with several bands affiliated with the innovative Northside label.  A strong sampler that may send you off on many rewarding musical journeys!",B00005NBV6
I purchased this as a key chain; but instead it came at 3x the size I was expecting,B000066CMC
"This is not a keychain. Its like 3 inches long 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches thick, way bigger than i expected. Its plastic and has a button on the front that when pressed plays sounds and lights up. I wanted a keychain but i got something i can put in my display case instead.",B000066CMC
"I love this Keychain!!! I had one back when I was a little kid but it got lost somewhere and never saw it again. So when I found this one, I couldn't pass up buying another one. I have collected Star Wars toys since I was little and Star Wars is my life. This keychain brings back such amazing memories from when I was a kid and I love the light and sound features on it. Now, I just need to find another Obi-Wan Kenobi Jedi Starfighter to go with the Slave 1. This keychain was released back when Episode 2 was in theaters and this was the last year of the Star Wars toys being cool. Once Revenge Of The Sith came out and further on, the toys aren't good at all. If you are looking for an additional Star Wars keychain for the collection, definitely consider adding this one to the collection. You will not regret it.",B000066CMC
"When I first saw these, I wanted one. I was thrown aback by the price a little, though, plus I wasn't certain if the two sounds it made were worth it - no matter how ""correct"" they sounded. After looking and looking, someone finally felt I need them and purchased one for me. Not only is a little Slave-1 roaming around with me interesting, but I was also impressed with how well the keychains interact with one another. Its an interesting thing to have my keychains clash after I hang them by the door, making me laugh a little even after the most annoying days.",B000066CMC
"I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security.",B000074RL3
"Finally. I've tried so many sports bras since my chest bloomed cantaloupes, I've lost count. This is the one. I will never, ever buy another brand / model of sports bra.

Be advised, getting into it the first time will be a struggle. Do the bottom-most hook and eye first, then position the breasts into the cups, then continue. There's no other way to do it. This is a TIGHT bra. It has to be, to immobilize comfortably.

If this bra had been available when I was in High School, I might have actually learned to enjoy sports--and I might have ended up a lot less klutzy.

And I'm wearing it to work as a minimizer today.",B000074RL3
There isn't another one out there that compares...if you don't want bounce than get this one.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think there should be rows of closures so when it stretches out..you can make it smaller.,B000074RL3
"This bra is so suportive and comfortable that, once accustomed to it, you won't want to ever wear a regular bra again.  It really lifts things where they should be and improves the fit of clothing.  My blouses no long gap at the buttons.  Also is nice and smooth under tees and sweaters.  The hooks do not stick out as often happens in front hook bras and are totally unnoticeable even under snug clothing.  I'll never buy another bra again.",B000074RL3
I am a top heavy girl and this sports bra is wonderful. No movement at all/,B000074RL3
"I bought my Enell about 4 months ago and it's been fantastic! I can't say enough good things about it. I used to have to wear 2 sports bras and even then I bounced and it HURT!

They do run very tight, but that's good because they get looser as you're exercising. At first I thought mine didn't fit because I was so squeezed in, but that just means that it fits perfectly. I can't say enough good about this bra.

One down side? Mine has no wear, but I need a new one. It's made it so much easier for me to exercise I've lost enough weight to need the next size down.",B000074RL3
"Finally! A sports bra for larger busted women that WORKS! I've been searching and searching for a sports bra to keep the bounce to a minimum. I'm a 36DD and this is the first sports bra that I can run in without pain. Be warned...it's a squeezer, but once you are in it they don't move much.

Check around for the best price. I got mine on e-bay.",B000074RL3
"This is my GO TO, never leave the house if I plan on doing any physical activity (e.g. biking, working out, running, fast walking). I am 34DDD. I have never in my life found a better bra. I searched 30 years to find this. Oprah talked about it on one of her shows, years ago.",B000074RL3
"In the last ten years, I have bought five of these bras.  They are the only ones I exercise in.  I don't even have to think about the bounce.  My normal bra size range is 34/36 around the rib cage and cup size G/H.  With this bra, I am a size 3.  This bra is well made.  Though I no longer wear the 10 year old bra for exercising, I do wear it otherwise.  This is after extensive exercising and washing wear-and-tear.  With careful washing and air-drying (do not put dryer!!), this bra is constructed to last a long, long time.  The only downfall is that it is not pretty. Not one bit.  I am ordering a pink one, but still.....",B000074RL3
"As an F cup I have been through MANY sports bras to find one that compresses, encapsulates and minimizes any bounce. I'm pleased to say that this more than meets my expectations. I have tried a few different ones since getting my first Enell but I keep coming back to this. If you want something designed for *high* impact then this should be your go to. This will take care of you while you do everything from burpees to jumping jacks to high knees. A lot of people do not like that the band can run tight but its designed to compress and support the breasts. I will grant you that they aren't the cutest design but if it worries you that much then throw a cute top on over it. You're there to work and this bra is there to support and protect you every step of the way while you do. Breast tissue is very delicate so don't risk injury or discomfort for the sake of looking good. You'll look and feel better being lean and fit without injuries. It is on the expensive end but consider it an investment that you won't regret. With proper care mine have lasted several years. Enell uses high quality material and its designed to last. From one woman to another, for the sake of your breasts invest in one of these.",B000074RL3
"So, after hearing my daughter rave about this exercise bra I decided to buy one. I had been looking for something that would keep me motionless up top as I run and jump rope. I might add that I've never spent what amounts to the annual salary of a worker in an underdeveloped nation for one exercise bra. It's quite ridiculous especially when considering what I'm about to say...

Oh, don't get me wrong. It looks quite formidable--just like the pics, but au contraire. I was excited as I put her on for a test drive this morning. It looked pretty inconspicuous under my clothes-- a good sign I told myself. I walked a couple laps around the track then picked up my jump rope and proceeded to jump & JIGGGLLLLEE-- yes ladies-- jiggle. I'm reeeeaally disappointed because I'm rather shy and needed something that would allow me to jump rope sort of unnoticed while out in public. It looks like it'd probably serve well as a bust minimizer, but it's not my idea of a truly supportive exercise bra.
And, it's certainly not worth the $64 I paid.

To be even more candid, I get more support from my 12+ year old ""champion"" exercise bra! (I'm soo glad I've not disposed of it yet.)",B000074RL3
"I've been looking for a good sports bra for a long time.  I ride horses, and wear a 36DDD bra, so I need really good support when running/riding/doing anything more energetic than walking.  I've spent a fortune on sports bras looking for the right one, and I've found a lot of good ones.  This one is GREAT.  Really.  It's fantastic.

The Pros:
- Once you're in, you're in, and you're not going anywhere.
- The band isn't restrictive - it didn't impact my breathing like some bras do, and it is definitely more comfortable than wearing two (or three) sports bras at once.
- Having a front closure (versus just trying to shimmy your way into a sewn top with no closures) is essential in a sports bra for well-endowed women, and this one doesn't disappoint.
- It has a very high neckline, so the girls don't spill out of the top or sides.
- Super, supreme, amazing bounce control.  I don't feel like I'm being pornographic while exercising anymore.
- It MINIMIZES.  So for those of you who ride horses and are looking for a bra to help you fit into your show coat better, this is the bra for you.  No more gaps between my show coat or show shirt buttons!!!

The Cons:
- It's UGLY.  I don't mean cute little bulldog ugly.  I mean embarassing uncle you avoid at family reunions ugly.  You will not go running in a pair of capris and just this bra.  You will hide it with layers.  Ideally thick layers, because the seams are hideous.
- It takes an act of God and a willing partner to get into.  I was actively sweating by the time I got the thing on the first time.  I can usually get my husband to help now - A third arm is useful.
- The fabric looks and feels cheap, and I'm concerned it won't hold up over time.  I guess I shouldn't really list this as a con because it hasn't fallen apart or anything yet...I guess I just expect more quality for the price.

Overall, I highly recommend this bra.  It's the best I've found so far for the type of exercising I do, and the pros significantly outweigh the cons!",B000074RL3
"I tried this bra after the recommendation of a friend, and seeing it mentioned on a television program.  I don't like the underwire bras.  They have never fit me well, and usually, the wires work their way out,  But, I have rheumatoid arthritis, and I can't manage bras that clasp in the back.  I don't have the flexibility to reach back, or the strength to twist the bra to put the clasp in the back.

It fits more like the upper half of a tank top, and in the summer, it can be very warm.  It is heavy.  It is not a lightweight, thin fabric garment.  So, it isn't the bra I'd choose in July, on a 100 degree day, to go to an amusement park or outdoor activity, even though I know the back support would be wonderful.  But, inside, and the rest of the year... it is so comfortable....  and it provides support for my back.  I was astonished at the effect on my back.  Also, as other women have said, you DO NOT move.  At all.  It is wonderful support.  I was reluctant to spend the money when I could not try it on first.  I asked at area shops (the real undergarment ones), and oddly, no one had heard of them.  But, a friend was so adamant that I tried it.  As long as you take accurate measurements, you will be fine.  The charts are accurate.  They aren't frilly and fancy, but the frilly and fancy ones don't provide support to the front, or to my back, and who sees it under clothing?  Comfort is the goal.  I generally pay $50 for a bra, but, these last much longer than the front closure mastectomy bras I buy.  My only complaint is that they are heavy, but, without the construction, I'd have no back or chest support.",B000074RL3
"I used to double up on regular sports bras just to stop my boobs from giving me black eyes while running. I mean, it didn't work that well and not only would there be plenty of jiggle, it was also waaaay too hot. I'm a 34DD, and these changed my life. I'm not even exaggerating here -- this bra made exercising enjoyable and made it possible for me to do a lot of things that were once painful. Now, whenever I see another large breasted comrade run by, I wince at the sinusoidal motion of their boobs and I hope to myself that they are running to the store to get an Enell bra.

These hold your boobs in TIGHT. I can jump and there is zero movement. The material has very little give, so it's really important to get the right fit. I've pretty much always been a 34DD, even through weight loss and weight gain. I went with a size 1. At my heaviest, the size 1 felt a little constricting at the ribcage. As I lost some weight, it was very very comfortable, without sacrificing any of the hold. It will be really strange to put this on at first, but you'll get used to it. Sometimes, when I get back from the gym, I'll forget I have it on.

When I first got this, I was really concerned about breathability. At face value, the material and the AMOUNT of material makes it really daunting. However, I can assure you that these are absolutely breathable and you won't feel like you're drowning in your own sweat. I usually wear them for runs (3-5 miles), but I also used them a lot for hikes. I have gone on hikes over 20 miles with no issues. I even wore these guys when I climbed Kilimanjaro.

I don't really have anything negative to say about these, but I do have some advice. Be careful when you are washing these, as the hooks can get caught on things and it can also ruin the hooks themselves. I have four of these bras and I've had most of them for over two years now; only two of them have a few hooks on them that are a bit wonky because I wasn't careful when it comes to washing. ALSO, when I first started using these, I got two of them (they are rather expensive), but I would use them almost every day, and sometimes twice a day. I would just thoroughly hand wash these in my sink after a workout and hang them up to dry and they would be ready the very next day. This will save money and honestly, I think it helped my bras last longer by not putting them through the washing machine all the time. Lastly, I've noticed in the bras that I've bought, the sizes are not 100% consistent. I have a purple, a black, a pink, and a white bra. Out of all of them, the purple and black are the most comfortable. The pink one feels a lot smaller than the other ones. However, if you wear them enough, they do eventually stretch a bit and conform to your body.",B000074RL3
"I love this bra. I am a competitive, thin, fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is a lot of potential for jiggling to outright flopping. In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement. It is a compression bra, so you are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing. And when I am working out hard I'm a make-up-less, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?

Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into it, so I figured I would tell you the easiest way:
1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.
2. Leave your boobs where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.
3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit height.
4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.
5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra and scoop up your left boob and pull it into the bra. Do the same with your left hand, right boob.
6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing the same general direction, then easily hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.
Ta-Da!

I will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C or smaller this may not be the bra for you. If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not need a bra this sturdy. For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking. However, if you are an older lady who maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of gravity for as long as possible.",B000074RL3
the best sports bra that I know of.,B000074RL3
"This is the best sport bra!!!
I've been using this product for about 7 years already!
Love it!
I have tried different brands but nothing like Enell.
Just make sure you order the right size.",B000074RL3
I am a 44h and Wear a 6.  This is the BEST bra ever for workouts!  Is it attractive?  No!  Easy to get into?  No!  Make my boobs look great?  No!  Does it keep my boobs from flapping all over?  YES!  Is it comfortable?  Yes- once I get buckled in to it!  Can I run in it?  Yes- without black eyes!  Awesome back and shoulder support!  The price is totally worth it!!!!!!  They also wear well!  My first one is almost 10 years old!,B000074RL3
"This sports bra is the one if your a C cup or above. I am a DDD and never have I found a sports bra that can hold in the girls during cross fit and running. It is a bit uncomfortable to get on but, once one it is great! I have bought quite a few online and had to return them all because they just didn't hold up to anything more than walking.",B000074RL3
"Until I found the enell bra, there was just no way I could run. If I tried I hated it -- 32DD, it was uncomfortable and I could sense the damage running or jogging did to my breasts.

As soon as I put this bra on, I felt amazing. Suddenly 4+ lbs of weight was taken off my chest. I stood taller, and it immediately improved my posture. But most excitingly, I can run!! And I love it!! I can sprint in this bra and my breasts barely move at all. When I see other runners in the park, bouncing around all over the place I want to tell them ""YOU NEED THIS BRA!!"" but of course, I don't want to look like a madwoman, haha.

To get the best effect of the bra, you do need to go pretty tight, which for me is too tight to wear if I'm not running. I take it off straight after or it can feel restrictive. But not so restrictive that it effects my breathing while exercising.

I started on a size 0 (When I was probably more of a 34DD). I've now gone down to a 00 (I'm now 32DD-E -- yes, my breasts grew, eek). I like to wear the 0 still for low-impact exercise like pilates or using the cross-trainer at the gym. It's still effective. But for running I wear 00 to really feel locked in.

Honestly, I don't know where I'd be without this bra. I wouldn't have discovered my love of running and I wouldn't be anywhere near as active as I am today.",B000074RL3
"Tractors don't have suspensions so things get ridiculously bumpy. I drive a tractor 10 hours a day, 4 days a week so I give this thing a run for the money! People stare just because I'm a woman, no need to add bouncing boobs to the show! The first week I wore this was pretty rough. The lower elastic band hurt & my twisting to the right while driving 10k times per day caused chafing. I put a bandage over the chafing & continued wearing it. I wash it & hang it to dry at night so it's ready to go at 5am the next morning. I highly recommend visiting the manufacturer's website & measuring to make sure you order the correct size. The price is pretty high for a bra, but I have found that to get a good bra I have to spend about that much anyway. In order to get a good fit, I usually go to the high-end stores and endure a fitting that makes me feel as the fitter should've at least bought me dinner first. So it was nice to get a good fit without that experience. My triple Ds make me look larger than I am so I enjoy the lift & minimizing effect the bra gives. There is, however one MAJOR drawback. You can see in the picture a distinctive line on the bra where a standard bra would typically end. THIS IS VISIBLE THROUGH A SHIRT! That gives the look that I'm wearing some sort of fancy bustier or something. I've caught more than one guy staring. Remove that line & I'd give it 5 stars any day.",B000074RL3
"Best sports bra on market to keep boobs from moving during any type of exercise. Does the job everytime. My method of donning is put on like vest, lay down on back on bed, hook each clasp one at a time starting from bottom. Success!",B000074RL3
"I'm a 32F and I'm always on the hunt for a bra that can help my chest stay in place. I exercise 5-6 times a week and have an ever changing line up of bra's to support my bust.

This bra had amazing reviews so I thought that I would give it a shot. I found that the rib cage portion fit tightly as expected, but the cups are a bit roomy at the top. I used the Enell measurement system from their site and actually ordered a bit on the small side for my measurements.

I was hoping that this bra would out perform two staples in my line-up (Anita Extreme Control Sports Bra and Shock Absorber Women's Ultimate-Run Sports Bra). Sadly, I feel that my chest moves more in the this bra than in either of my other staples. Also I find that the stitching on the rib cage underneath my arms rubs and creates irritation. That combination has me leaving this bra in my drawer instead of on my body.

I'm not sure if I have the wrong size (though I don't think I could get the rib cage portion to close if I ordered any smaller) or not, but this bra has been a disappointment. I wanted so much for this to be my new staple bra. On to the next...

That said, I think that this bra could work well with a body shape different than mine.",B000074RL3
"After reading massive reviews about this sports bra, I decided to take the financial plunge.  Plus, the other sports bras I use, my size was ALWAYS sold out at the store (Lane Bryant), and I've even had my online orders canceled because they were sold out.  I'm a pretty active (5-6 days a week) plus sized woman.  I do cardio at the gym, as well as a yoga sculpt class that is more HIIT type of workout.  With my other sports bras, there is a lot of bounce, even doing the elliptical machine.  When I have this sports bra armor on, there is nothing.  Maybe if I jump really fast I get a small amount of bounce, but nothing noticable!

So, getting into this thing is a feat, but its worth it.  All I could suggest is making sure you have it fitted properly on the arms and side before you start hooking it up because its not going to be moveable afterward.

**Edit/Update**
I just wanted to update this review, I've now accumulated 3 of these sports bras and have had them for the last 3 years.  Still look and perform NEW.  No loose threads, no rips, tears, nothing.  I wash them in the machine, then hang dry.  They are worth the money!!!!  I have a Livi by Lane Bryant sports bra that I've had for 2 years and it's stretched out and I barely use it because it hurts my shoulders.  The Livi bra is my ""oh F I forgot to wash my good sports bras"" sports bra.  So, it maybe gets 2 wears a month.  These get used 4-5 days a week, and washed weekly.  They fit as if I bought them yesterday.  LOVE ENELL!!",B000074RL3
"I have been looking for a sports bra that would keep the girls in place.  I searched through reviews and finally decided on this brand.  I love it.  It's more compression and gives you the uni-boob look... but, I'm working out so I don't care what I look like.  It fits *very* snuggly which I had to get used to.  I wear it during exercise and when I'm pretty active (deep cleaning the house, yardwork, etc).  I highly recommend this product for those of us that need the support!",B000074RL3
"Just ordered my fifth and sixth Enell bras and I will never, ever buy another sports bra.  I have tried hundreds (formerly a size 46DDD and currently a 36DDD) and not a single one has fit as comfortably or held the girls as firmly as my Enells.  Here's my two cents:

- Yep, they're ugly.  They peek out from some of my v-neck gym shirts.  The seams show through.  But, guess what?  I think everyone at the gym knows I'm wearing a bra and that it's probably a sports bra meant to support the girls.  So, I don't worry about it.  I buy the black and if it peeks out, so what?

- Enells are hilariously challenging to get into.  This is not a normal bra.  There's a lot of lifting and shifting to get the girls situated.  Definitely start hooking up from the bottom, reach in there and move those girls around until you're comfortable (my tip:  move them up and out to the sides).  It will give you a giggle but there won't be any wiggle.

- In my experience, buy for the band size.  My first Enell was bought for the breast size and it was uncomfortably snug, although it did loosen up during workouts as other reviewers have said.  I bought subsequent bras for the band size and was much happier.  Because the fabric has NO STRETCH, I find that even a slightly larger size still keeps the girls from bouncing and is extremely comfortable.  Again, this is not a normal bra.  DO NOT BUY IT BASED ON YOUR NORMAL BRA SIZE - FOLLOW THE FIT CHART ON THE ENELL.COM PAGE!  The bra definitely feels weird and even uncomfortable when you first try it on, but you will get used to the snugness and come to appreciate the total support this bra offers.

- Embrace the uni-boob.  My friends and I joke about the compression of this bra, but did I mention I will never, ever wear another sports bra?  I will happily sport the uni-boob during my runs if it means no pain!

Although I have worn Enells for years for all my workouts, I recently started running.  I wouldn't have even attempted to run in any other bra.  I cannot emphasize how comfortable the Enell is while exercising, how secure I feel in it, and how much it reduces movement of any kind in the boob area.  Totally worth the money and the only sports bra I will ever buy again!",B000074RL3
"I ADORE this bra! And if I had more cash, I'd purchase enough to put a fresh one every day of the week, working out or not! I'm a SAHM, regular bra size 46DD and prefer sports bras while chasing around my three boys ages 5 and under. I need lots of support due to bust size and back problems and this bra delivers, along with comfort and breathability, which surprised me. And I like the color choices, given the ""Iron Maiden"" type bra that it is, LOL
It's sturdy, the hook and eye closures hold up well, a bit challenging to get on (TIP: try leaning forward and adjusting yourself into it as you go, hooking a couple hooks at a time), but well worth the money!",B000074RL3
"I am a 36f & this is really the only bra I found works for me with all the impact involved in running. It does fit tight, but that's what I need. I like so well I own 2 & have for years.",B000074RL3
"If you like breasts that are cube-shaped, this is the one for you! As much as I loved the back of this bra, I positively gasped at how it made my chest look. It got rid of any roundness, and just flattened the front...not a flattering look. Returning tomorrow...and the search continues.",B000074RL3
"I really like the way this bra fits.  It has a very cute shape and is comfortable and secure.  If I jump up and down I do still have quite a bit of bounce, but less than I've ever had before.  I like the shape, it doesn't give me uniboob, it looks good under clothes.  It does have a seam that you can see through clothes, so that is kind of irritating.  But overall it looks so good I don't mind it.  I'll buy a couple more of these.  I wish I could find a daily bra that was shaped as cute as this one is.",B000074RL3
"My title says it all.
I've always been pretty sporty and I developed early, so I've been searching for the perfect sports bra for a while now.  Oh, and FYI, perfect = no movement whatsoever.  I'm a D/DD so that was historically impossible to find so I just wore two sports bras simultaneously and just dealt with it until I found the Enell (aka Title Nine's ""Last Resort"" bra)

This bra revolutionized my workouts.  I rarely ran due to jiggle, now I can. An hour on a trampoline in Cardiolates class? No problem!  Granted this bra is not even remotely pretty, my sisters call it a ""straight jacket"", it's strictly for us utilitarians. (It works so well though, you won't care what it looks like.)

I can't sing this brassiere's praises enough but to say: I do not waste time buying other sports bras anymore, I simply keep replacing my Enells (I currently have two I rotate)",B000074RL3
"I am a 38 F and I train for half marathons and marathons every now and then.  This bra works so much better than any other bra I have found.  The bounce factor is practically eliminated and somehow, it is snug, but not tight and manages to NOT pull on my shoulders (you know how you get those deep crease lines from where the elastic digs into your shoulder because it's trying to hold up too much weight?) or dig in.  I LOVE IT!",B000074RL3
"First off with this review I want to give you my measurements. I am a 40D - small DD depending on the bra. My true rib cage size is actually 39. Based on Enell's sizing, I am a size 3 or at least comfortable in a size 3. Anyway on to the juice!!
I bought this bra because I wanted to do a couch to 5k type of program. I'm on the heavier side (I wear an XL) and experience the dreaded boob bounce. I HATE boob bounce. I just can't deal with it and it has gotten so painful with non-supportive Walmart sports bras in the past that I have literally duct taped my boobs down. This bra? It straight jackets your boobs down. There are 11 hook and loop eyelets in the front that seal you into this bad girl. If spending that much time strapping/stuffing your boobs in may annoy you, you may want to look elsewhere. A tip I want to give to all ladies out there is when you first try out this bra, stand up, bend at your waist like you would touch your toes, and shake your boobs into the cups. You will feel more comfortable and notice a difference in the fit versus just strapping yourself in and running out the door. Expect it to be a tight, not painfully tight or bothersomely tight but you will always know your boobs are there and not moving because of this awesome bra. Also I haven't had a single hotspot develop. The bra is higher riding under your arms versus a regular bra but is very smooth in my opinion so there isn't anything to annoy you. Keep in mind that the cups aren't padded so if you are running outside and things get chilly you may want a hoodie to coverup with. This is such an amazing high quality bra and I can't recommend it enough.

So rejoice fellow big boobied girls - you can do jumping jacks without flopping or bouncing!",B000074RL3
"I'm not sure how anyone can complain about this bra.  I have tried EVERY bra for running/high impact sports and this is the ONLY bra that stops bouncing.  Is it pretty?  No.  Is it comfortable? No.  Do I wear it when I'm not running? NO!  It smashes your boobs so flat that they cannot bounce when running, and it is a horror to put on, but it WORKS!  I am a 32DDD, no kids or plastic surgery, and finding a bra that allows me to run outside without being embarrassed about the ""show"" I'm giving every car that drives by....PRICELESS.  I put it on right before I run and take it off right after I return (otherwise it chafes me in the front).  I wash it in the machine on gentle and hang it dry; it's worth every penny and I am buying another today.",B000074RL3
"Like everyone here, I had high hopes of FINALLY finding the ""Holy Grail"" of sports bras! No more wearing 2 sports bras to work out! No more uni-boob (from the ""lift and separate"" look of the picture). I followed the instructions that came with it...everything lined up where it was supposed to before hooking, hooking from the bottom up, adjusting your breasts from the top to get them into place.  The first thing I noticed was that the center seam cut into my breast so it looks like they're split in half horizontally. Not attractive but oh well...I bought it not to bounce! And...unfortunately it didn't do that either. I, too, did the ""bounce test"" and sure enough...the girls were bouncing up and down too. Now I have a fairly large chest (40DD) but compared to some of the reviewers who had amazing results, that's child's play! THOSE are the reason why I bought this one! So not only do I still bounce just as much as the 2-bra method, I have the uni-boob AND the weird seam bisecting them. Three strikes...you're out. I'm not even going to attempt to do my typical workouts (P90x, Insanity, Running).",B000074RL3
I too bought this bra because of the stellar reviews.  HATE IT!  Sizing is ridiculous!  Squishes you too flat for comfort.  I felt like I was potentially damaging my boobs.  Would not recmmend this product to anyone with DDDs.,B000074RL3
"I've been wearing two bras every time I run:  the Lululemon Tata Tamer and the Anita Sports Bra because it's the only way to keep my boobs from bouncing around.  Then my friend told me about the Enell Sports Bra and I ordered it from Amazon.  Well, I did a test run today (4 miles) and it is awesome.  This bra firmly holds everything in place!  It's a relief not to have to wear two bras anymore.  The only drawbacks (aside from the appearance) is: (1) it's very tight around the rib cage, so I had to wear it with the first/bottom hook unhooked and (2) it feels like you are wearing a breastplate - so, it looks a bit awkward underneath thin, workout shirts.  Also, because this bra is very form fitting and restrictive, it's not one of those sports bras where you can wear all day.  Overall, It is the best running bra available for bigger chested women.  I'm 5'0, weigh 120lbs, 34D and the size 00 was perfect for me.",B000074RL3
"I really am pleased with this bra so far. I do have a large bust so it has always been a struggle to find something that will hold me in and keep my breasts from bouncing about when I workout. I just had my second baby so I needed something more heavy duty. I did the bounce test of jumping jacks and jogging in place and am amazed how well everything stayed put.

I did a lot of research for a sports bra and read the reviews for this one. Yes it does give you a Uni boob, but so do a lot of other sports bra. Not to mention I wouldn't wear this bra around if I weren't working out.

Not crazy about the color I got, but I plan on buying more once the baby weight starts to come off.",B000074RL3
"I recently had a baby and needed to get some sports bras for ""large-breasted"" women.  After doing some research and asking friends, I wound up purchasing one Anita Momentum in 34G, 3 Panache Sport in 34F (UK sizing is slightly different, 34F UK = 34G USA), and one Enell in size 1.

Initially I liked the Panache bras the best (that's why I ended up with 3).  While the Enell provides the very best support (your girls are not going ANYWHERE in an Enell), it's fugly.  The Panache and the Anita provide similar support to one another, and are both more attractive than the Enell.  I found the support of the Panache bras slightly better than the Anita bra.  The Panache bras are also somewhat padded, which gives a nice smooth look (no nipple outlines when you're cold).

Over time, though, as my milk supply evened out, my breasts dropped several sizes, and the Panache and Anita bras no longer fit, while the Enell did.  The Enell has so much compression that it can accommodate fluctuating breast sizes.  That means it ended up being the only bra that I am still using.

In summary - I consider the Enell to be the best bra of the bunch.  Too bad it's so unattractive.  :/

P.S.  All 3 bras are roughly the same price, unless you can find one of them on sale.",B000074RL3
It fits perfectly and it really works. I am so happy after I spent my money in a few bras that they were supposed to work. It is expensive but it is so worth it.,B000074RL3
"Yes, this bra is very tight, yes, it smooshes you as flat as possible giving you the uniboob look -- I call it the Boob Masher 5000, or ""Chinese foot binding for boobs"".  But that's WHY it works, because it binds the breasts snugly to the ribs... if you are large breasted (I'm 38DDD) you will not find a bra that keeps the breasts prettily separated AND keeps them from bouncing.  There's just too much mass.  I wear this for hiking, jogging, horseback riding (from short 5-10 mile rides through 25 and 50 mile endurance rides), and when I am on the tractor which bounces me to death over our bumpy ground.  The breasts still jiggle a little but they do not painfully bounce.  I need to order a size 3 because I am still squeezing into my old size 2, leftover from when I was 36DD.  Since there is no sizing info for this particular bra on amazon, go to the Enell website's sizing guide.  If the stock bras do not fit, you can also custom order from them to have shorter straps or a smaller band with larger cup size, etc.  You can even custom order an asymmetrical color combo with different colors on different parts of the bra.

For those who have trouble getting into this bra, you are supposed to start hooking from the bottom and work your way up, redistributing the breast tissue as needed.

For those who are complaining about how the bra looks, decide whether you want to actually work out comfortably, or look cute but be in pain.  Why are you worried about the bra top showing above a low-necked shirt, or the seams showing under a tight shirt, when you are (theoretically) sweating like a horse in Zumba class or on the elliptical anyway?  Wear a higher-necked or looser shirt, for Pete's sake.  The fabric is very shiny as some complain about, but it is wicking; and there are a good number of color choices.",B000074RL3
"I cannot say enough good things about this product. I got my first enell bra just over 3 years ago. I am a 36D, formerly 36B. This bra holds me up even better than any of the bras I wore prior to my ""enhancement.""
  I have a VERY physically demanding Job as a commercial military diver and I must admit that these bras are tough as nails and second to none. I have ran 5K's, 10K's, Obstacle courses, Mud runs, and mini triathalons in this bra. I swim, dive and Skydive in this bra. I even have a couple (2) that after torturing it beyond it's bottom 3 hooks (rusted through From the salt water) STILL HOLD ME UP DURING MY RUNNING AND CROSSFOT WORKOUTS!!! This bra is pretty much a bad a** >:D",B000074RL3
"Absolutely love Enells sports bra, especially for larger chested woman. I am a 42HH and I wear a size 8 and it give the perfect amount of support I do not feel like I am going to fall out when I am running. Great product for anyone who is in search of a sports bra that really holds you in.",B000074RL3
"i bought this bra bc i am newly pregnant and my boobs are KILLING me. i know, its not a maternity bra per say but strapping them down is all i was really looking for and since oprah recommended it, it must me amazing...i ordered a 1 (bust between 36-39 & rib cage between 31-33) i'm actually bust 34D & ribs 28 but i thought i'll get bigger. upon wearing it, yes like other reviews say it does make you flat but that is a welcomed change for me :  ) however i couldn't hook the bottom 3 hooks bc it was SO tight on my ribs it was painful to breath...and thats at a size up of what i actually am. bc of the price i will wear it like that to bed until it falls apart.",B000074RL3
"I am so excited to see that Amazon sells this sports bra.  I had been getting mine from the Title 9 website.  I am in the military and we work out a lot.  My breast are 32F.  I will tell you they just don't make many sports bras that are small enough for my frame but compensate for my larger breast size.  This isn't a sexy sports bra but it works.  You will see the ridges through your shirt but you are at the gym to work out no look sexy.  I have started to get the black ones as they are less likely to get dingy over time.  They last longer if you wash in a lingerie bag and hang dry. If you don't the wire hooks will get all bent up and the paint will peel.  The dryer is no place for any bras as it will shrink some parts, melt others.  Really at this price you want it to last.  I have had mine for years.  I would give 10 Stars if I could.  I used to wear two sports bras before The Last resort came around.",B000074RL3
"This is the only sports bra that I have ever worn that can also be used as a minimizer as well. It worked very good at flattening my big chest making it impossible for the big huge sacks I call breast to even budge one centimeter.

The downfalls of this bra is that it is hard to put on the first time and really does not break in and feel comfortable and natural until you have worn the thing many times. Also it took time to put the bra on as it has over 10 hooks to fasten painstakingly one at a time.

However, the positive is that I had this same model bra for over 2 years and has survived constant wear, tear, and abuse.

To sum up this review it is worth the money if you are up to enduring some discomfort until the bra breaks in and is looking for an excellent minimizer.

AS for an actual sports bra for activities where you will be doing alot of moving and flexing of the upper body I do not recommend this bra. You might want to try the Moving Comfort line as they have excellent support for big chests.",B000074RL3
"I bought this bra for $79. I do think it gives decent bounce control (42D) but the band is too tight if the cup size is correct and is giving appropriate bounce control. In addition, the straps are far to short for anyone that is taller or has a long torso causing the bra to either slide up or cut into the shoulder. I actually took a pair of scissors to mine lengthening the band by two inches, adding a 2-3 inch strap extension with extra soft padding on top of the shoulder. The final sewing adjustment was to trim the top 3 hooks and create a bra that is not similar to wearing a straight jacket. Waste of a lot of cash.",B000074RL3
"To all you women out there with more than the average bust - listen to me.  I am 44DD and take a cardio class with lots of running, jumping, and other boob-unfriendly activities.  I was in pain from things bouncing around and nearly gave myself a black eye during each class.  Stop laughing!  It's true.  I found info on this bra on some runner's forum and I think to myself huzzah! this is what I need.  I looked online for local retailers (sorry Amazon, my next one will come from you!) and went to get one.  My god! the difference this bra makes.  I wore it today to my cardio class and came home with no pain in the bust!  I love this bra.  Yes, it fits snug, so if you're used to the way your regular bra fits, then this will be a little different.  Nothing moves in this bra - not during jumping jacks, not running in place, not doing kickboxing.  BUY THIS BRA - YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",B000074RL3
"I love this Bra and it makes me want to exercise more! I am a size 38DD and I was having a hard time even power walking, I am now jogging and excited to be able to do more atletic things! I didn't get my Enell online, I went to a local store because I wanted to try it on first. ( the price is too high to play the guessing game) According to the chart I should have been a size 3, but because I am rapidly losing weight, I went with the size 2. (I was on the border of a 3-2). I am very satisfied with this bra and would recommend it to anyone. You can play around with cheaper bra's and go for ones that you think look cuter (whoever said a sports bra should be cute!!!) but you are risking stretching the ligaments in your breast which means SAGGING!! No thanks! I would rather be a little uncomforable and protect my breasts from sagging. So, I am one happy girl with the Enell!",B000074RL3
"Even though i didn't get it straight through amazon, i did buy this specific Bra. I have very large brests, and my biggest issue was what if i get the wrong size, its so expensive. Well i finally got it. I do Zumba EVERY day and its working perfectly. i wear a pink ""Sports bra"" the kind that are only for apperence over it so that i can at least feel sexy while i work out in it. But all in all, there's NO bounce, and its very sturdy. im sure it will work for many months to come. (im only saying months because im losing weight, and ill have to order a smaller size after that!)",B000074RL3
"I have been graced with the natural *gift* of large hooters.  I'd always sort of seen it as a curse, especially when trying to work out.  Running and high impact activities have always been embarrasing for me.  And forget working with a trainer in the gym when he has you running stairs or jumping over things...oh the stares.  I was never been able to run before I got this bra. I will admit that it's tight, but after searching for years for the right solution, I'll take it.  Sometimes I even undo the bottom one or too hooks and that provides a little relief when I am on the heavier side.  Another plus is that I have always had terrible posture...I'm sure out of being self-conscious. My size appears drastically reduced when I wear this bra, and I have found that I stand up straighter and taller with confidence during my workouts.  I love this bra and highly recommend.  Two thumbs up!  I cannot thank Enell enough for developing this product!",B000074RL3
"I am a 42H who runs and does lots of high-impact exercise.  I have been layering 3 different sports bras (1 underwire for support and 2 compression) to keep the girls in control, but even that doesn't work so well.  I heard about this ""miracle sports bra"" for larger chested women, so I decided to give it a try.  My measurements put me on the border between size 5 and size 6.  I decided tighter is better, so I ordered the size 5.  It just arrived, and I immediately put it on.  I did a few jumping jacks and still felt like I was being smacked in the face.  While it is more comfortable than 3 bras, it offers very little bounce control for my girls.  The fit is still a little loose in the size 5, so maybe a smaller size would help, although that's way off from the sizing chart.  Unfortunately, I bought it through a 3rd party on an auction website, and I can't return it.  Thankfully, though, I paid half the retail price, so at least I'm not out the extremely high regular price for this bra.  Not sure whether it's the inaccurate fit guide or the bra itself, but I wouldn't recommend buying this without trying it on if you have very large breasts.",B000074RL3
"I first bought an Enell sports bra after the birth of my son while I was nursing and wanted to start getting back into shape.  I have always been blessed with a full figure but the blessing was greatly amplified by choosing to breast feed!  All the sports bras I found in the stores were useless to keep me from bouncing all around when I ran or played soccer. I have always been active in sports since high school and am now in my early 30's and this is the first sports bra I've found that truly does a great job of giving full busted women the support they need while being active.  Make sure to size by your actual measurements off the Enell sizing chart, not just what size bra you think you normally wear.  While nursing I bought two size 2 bras that fit great (yes, they are tight but it's supposed to be secure) and now that my son is weaned they are a touch large but still offer good support.  For reference, I was around a 38 D or DD while nursing and am now close to a 36D.",B000074RL3
"I am a 38 DD and I absolutely LOVE this sports bra! FINALLY a REAL sports bra with REAL support. I have never had my ""girls"" stay put when I'm exercising and to be frank I've avoided exercise for years because of it, sounds vain I know but I didn't want to break my breast tissue down or get stretch marks. I have no more worries about either issue because Enell keeps them fixed in place. I'm SO thrilled this bra came out, it sure beats all the other worthless so-called ""sports"" bras on the market that are more like leisure bras if you ask me.",B000074RL3
"I ordered this based on reviews and it holds up to what everyone says. I am currently a 38DD and the ""girls"" are supported. I didn't have problem with them hurting bit was embarassed when they bounced all over the place.  The sizing chart did say for me to get a size 3 but i ordered a 2 and it holds good!! Happy girl!!",B000074RL3
"I've been using this sports bra for years. Everytime I see a woman running and it looks like she could use more support. I yell out "" E-N-E-L-L!"" Hopefully they look it up and take note. It's worth the price and can last for years if properly cared for.",B000074RL3
"Best sports bra for running, step aerobics, jumping rope, etc.  (And if you didn't know, it's designed for all manner of busty women--not like some bras for busty women when what they really mean is plus-sized women.)
If you never liked running, etc because of bouncing around too much, Enell will solve the problem.
It's sort of expensive, but definitely worth it--especially considering you can spend $20 at Target for a flimsy, worthless 'high-impact' sports bra.
I've had mine for about 2 years and it's still got tight elastic/fabric, no loose stitches, and probably has at least 2 more years left in it.  As they say, you've tried the rest, now try the best.  And measure yourself and go by their size chart, not your regular cup size.",B000074RL3
"ok- I'm sure some people are thinking $66 for a sports bra?! well I am a believer! I'm a 38D (I wear a size 2) and I've never found a sports bra that eliminated bounce before this one. I can actually run and not worry about my chest bouncing about! If you don't have a problem with that then you won't fully appreciate how rare it is to find a bra that's comfortable, easy to get in and out of and actually lives up to the claim of eliminating bounce. I only wish I had found this sooner! I've already ordered a second one. I'll never use another brand of sports bra again. It does take some getting used to since it doesn't feel like any bra I've ever had before. My only complaint is I wish there wasn't a seam at the top of the cup- but I guess that can't be helped. The seam is not uncomfortable- just unsightly under tee-shirts.",B000074RL3
"Yes, when I first got this bra I was not thrilled about the look of it.  I am usually a complete bra snob, buying all the top brands, Chantelle, Harlequin, etc.  Lace, silk, satin...sugar and spice and all that.  But, when I signed up for a marathon I figured I'd need a really good sport bra that is no joke.  I had been using some other brands that offer true-to-size sports bras.  I'm a 32G...and once I find a great bra I usually stick with it.  It was hard for me to even try this bra.  But, after reading a review in Runner's world, I decided to try Enell.  Now this is the only bra I ever want to wear!!  I never get backaches in it.  Awesome bonus!!!  I wear a size 1 to run in.  I wear a size 2 for every day and everywhere else.  Sometimes when I wear a size 2 to work, I go straight to the gym after work and can still wear the size 2 to run in.  So I'm probably in between sizes and I can really go with either one.  The straps never dig.  Everything stays in place.  I never have to adjust.  I never have any chaffing.  The hooks never bother me or dig at all.  I readjust the breasts (split and tuck them) after I have the first two bottom hooks clasped.  I read the directions that came with this, and that is what they suggest you do.  I also viewed the tutorial video on the website.  So, I've never had a problem with it.  All in all, this is a relatively simple bra.  I wish it was cheaper...since there's really no fancy material, lace, etc.  Plus it's my every day bra and I hate that it costs so much.  I also own this in the lighter version, the Enell LITE.  It's perfect for every day, or for basic workouts.  I have run it in before, but prefer the original Enell.  The Enell LITE could easily be an every day bra and sport bra.  Still has better support during high impact exercises than any other sport bra I've ever tried.  You'll never feel fancy in this bra, but it will keep your tissues from the devastating effects of gravity...and give you comfort.  What is better than that?  Oh...this bra gives you the uniboob thing everyone dreads.  I don't really care about that too much.  Give me a uniboob over saggy boobs any day of the week!  For runners this bra is a must.  Where else can a 32G find a bra that fits and supports?",B000074RL3
"i love this bra absolutely NO bounce! i'm a size 36 ddd and run 3-5 miles a day, i swear no bounce. it's the best ever",B000074RL3
"I'm full figured and have tried for years to find a comfortable and supportive bra.  I saw the Enell sports bra and read some of the reviews and even though the price made me swallow hard, I decided to try it.  I was hoping to find something that was supportive and comfortable.  I was so disappointed when I tried it on.  If you call being mashed flat, it's supportive.  Comfortable...not after you hook it up.  I loved the fabric and the way it fits across the back, but there just isn't enough room in the front.  Pass on this if you wear a DD or bigger like I do.",B000074RL3
"This sports bra is by far the best ever. At first I was a litte upset about the price,but I decided to go ahead and try it any way,and it's worth every penny. Thanks Enell for creating something so wonderful.",B000074RL3
"The second I received the Enell sports bra in the mail I rushed to put it on.  I was glad I read the instructions first because they warned me that it would seem tight and how to put it on, which I immediately did.  I then proceeded to jump...and it was wonderful!  Whereas before jumping was painful, and embarrassingly bouncy, now there is minimal movement and I could join a double dutch team if I wanted to!  For all the women out there who put on 2-3 sports bras when they want to work out, stop torturing yourselves!  The Enell bra is extremely comfortable and it works!  Sure it's a nice chunk of change, but it's an investment, and one you won't soon regret!  The only downside is that now I have no excuse for not running!",B000074RL3
"This is one of the best sports bra's I have owned. For the first time I have been able to wear 1 bra and feel secure (figuratively and literally). In the past I have had to wear 2 bra's. The only thing that I would change is to have more separation between the breasts but otherwise this is a winner!!! Make sure you size yourself correctly as that is one of the reasons I think this bra works so well.
Go forth and enjoy minimal movement :)",B000074RL3
"This is the most durable, reliable, comfortable bra I have ever worn. Other manufacturers simply do not make bras that account for the need for women with larger cup sizes. While Enell may not recommend this bra for daily wear or for those larger than DD, I have found it to be the only one I trust to get me through a long day at work and flexible enough to accommodate the slight changes in weight up or down that I experience every month. You WILL NOT BOUNCE or fall out of this bra; your back will thank you every morning you wear it.",B000074RL3
"I was so thrilled when I got this bra and discovered that the other reviews were right!  I love/love it.  I am currently nursing my 7 month old, but really wanted to get back into running.  I didn't think it would be possible with my, shall we say, mega super enhanced breasts.  This bra made it possible.  It is a bit constricting in the ribcage as others indicated, and as the site indicated.  But, it works and is easy to adjust to.  I highly recommend it.",B000074RL3
"This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned.  I have been using them for over 6 years (well before Oprah endorsed them) - tossing out the ""normal"" bras in favor of these ""sports"" bras.  They are long lasting - I have some that are still in great shape after 4 years.  They were a god send for the hormonal changes following child birth.  It is my opinion that they are well worth the high price tag because of how comfortable, practical, and durable they are.

I recommend them to anyone who prefers to be supported.

the only downside - shoulder straps are a little wide - can show a little under wide necked shirts.  And they wouldn't work real well with a prom gown.  :)

A truly quality product.",B000074RL3
"I struggled for years with being a large chested runner.  I had to buy a new running bra every 6 months and pay $30 every time.  I saw this in the Title Nine Sports catalogue and they gave it  their first ever 5-barbell support rating.  I paid $60 and it was worth every penny.  I've been using the same one for 8 years and it is still more supportive than any other bra I tried.  It's amazingly durable.

I must admit that it takes some getting used to and takes a couple months to break in.  if you aren't large chested you won't like it or need it.

If I were a sports star and could endorse only one product, this would be it.",B000074RL3
"Look no further for a no-movement sports bra.  I don't care what activity you do..if you don't want bounce, you want this bra!!",B000074RL3
"I'm a 36DD; they are all natural and very heavy. Its difficult to find a sports bra that eliminates the bounce. This is a fantastic bra! Better than the Jogbra. I will never purchase another kind of sports bra again. Only downside is, it's not a ""cute"" sports bra. But if support is more important than looks, this is the bra for you.",B000074RL3
"Having a larger chest, its a challenge to find a regular bra that fits right let alone a sports bra. Many of the sports bras out there don't offer the necessary support to accomodate large breasted woman and the options that are available are limited. The Enell sports bra encases the breast and holds them in resulting in little to no bounce (it's almost like wearing a girdle for your chest). I recommend this bra for high impact activities such as running or cardio workouts.
As far as sizing, in a regular bra I wear a 32F or 34E. I ordered the Enell in a size ""0"" and maybe should have ordered it in a size ""1"" because its a little too tight around the rib cage.",B000074RL3
"I wear a large bra size (46 DDD), and have found that it's nearly impossible to find a good sports bra in my size. Thank goodness I finally discovered Enell. Not only do Enell's bras come in my size, but the bra actually does what Enell says it will do. I experience minimal bounce, and most importantly, my breasts do not spill out of the top of the bra. I got so sick of adjusting my boobs between reps at the gym! Enell put an end to that embarrassment. My Enell bra is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned--sports bra or otherwise. In addition, I've had it for more than a year now, and it is only experiencing minimal wear (some mild pilling, but it still supports me just as well as it did when it was new). Good fit, wears well, and it's comfortable too! You just can't go wrong with this bra. :)",B000074RL3
"Okay sure his bra is not gorgeous and isn't the type of sports bra you like running around in with no t-shirt over it, but this bra really is perfect for larger chested girls that love to run! I run marathons and have always had issues with bras cutting into my skin after the really long runs, because I need good firm support. Not with this one. The only complaint I have is that, it's not the most comfortable when it's really hot and humid out, but for Fall-Winter running, it's excellent.

I can't recommend Enell enough for very active large busted women! Definitely worth the price.",B000074RL3
"I've been an athlete my whole life and used to wear two sports bras PLUS an ace bandage to keep my ""girls"" in check but this ugly bra does a better job than that system ever did. I also coach and recommend it to my athletes who need the extra support. This bra is well worth the expense. TRIATHELETES: I leave the bottom 2-3 hooks unclasped under my suit during the swim so I can breathe and reach better. I button back up before hopping on the bike and all's good.",B000074RL3
"I am a 48F and I have tried many sports bras in my day.  This is the best one on the market for large breasts.  No bounce.  It can feel a little restrictive at first, but once you are used to the bra it is great.  Best for sports that involve running, walking, or any kind of bounce.  Not very good for sports that require intricate upper body movements like yoga.",B000074RL3
"I'm a very large cup size. Normal band size though. This works enough for me to engage in physical activities without injuring myself. The fit would be better if I wasn't so big, but if you're a normal size I image this would be fantastic. It wicks away sweat really well, and I don't feel restricted in my movements.",B000074RL3
"Love this bra. It is a bit larger and more encompassing than anything else I've tried, but for my 32Es, (I bought a 0 in this bra) it holds them in place extremely well.",B000074RL3
"I am a 40K (US Sizing) and have been looking into sports bras in my cup size. I decided to try the Enell Sport, and the first time I wore it, just went on a walk around the neighborhood with my son and husband. I did not realize how much effort I had to put into compensating for chest movement until I didn't have to.
For the first time ever, I can do jumping jacks and run without pain. There was still bounce, but it wasn't uncontrolled (which has been the case previously even with wearing multiple sports bras) and wasn't painful or jarring.
I can't actually describe in words how freeing it is to be able to exercise without pain from my breasts, shoulders, and back.
And the band is glorious. It fits like a dream and there is no chafing under or below the band because of the compression.
The only thing that will take some getting used to is that if I wear it for a couple hours and then take it off, there is a bit of pain due to the removal of the compression. (That is not a negative, just something for other buyers to be aware of as it feels VERY odd the first time it happens.)
If I could just wear this bra all day every day I would.",B000074RL3
"I have two of these bras and, while not perfect, they are the best sports bra for me. I have a very large natural bust and relatively small rib cage (32GG). I love this bra because it does not let my boobs move. I first purchased a size 2 and that worked well but I decided to get a size 1 for an even more secure fit. There is nothing, nothing, nothing sexy about this bra. It's ugly AF (shiny material) and it has visible seams but man does it do the job. It sucks that it's ugly because it shows in all of my work out tanks but I'll take an ugly bra and uniboob over being hesitant to do jumping jacks. I ran a 10 miler in this bra and I do all sorts of HIIT classes. Again, the material on this bra should really be improved. It is not moisture wicking or quick drying so you'll definitely want to get out of it as soon as you're done working out.",B000074RL3
"I was advised to wear a wire-free, front-close sports bra for a week after breast surgery.  I tried a variety:  Velcro closure, hook-and-eye closure, zipper closure.  For me, as a full-figured woman, the zipper closure worked best.  I really did not want to do up all these hooks after my morning shower, and I did not like the ""shimmering"" fabric.",B000074RL3
I love this bra. I've never before found a sports bra that offered enough support to prevent bounce and pain during running. Washes well.,B000074RL3
"I was so excited to buy this based on the reviews and I'm so disappointed.  I'm a 40H, and fit smack into the size 5 according to the website which is where I bought it and paid a pretty penny too.  It fits well, but it doesn't control the bounce at all.  I wore it to kickboxing and found myself gripping the girls with my elbows to try and hold them down.

I don't know how I could have been so stupid as to buy a sports bra with straps that are not adjustable at all, I know better than that.  Even after just 2 or 3 wearings it is becoming even less supportive and no way to adjust it.  Very disappointed.",B000074RL3
"I can't say enough about these bras.  I've been big breasted since my early teens and I was always athletic.  I ran track, played ball, did long distance running, etc and always had to wear two bras (back then, they didn't have quality sports bras for women like me).  After many years, I found Enell Sports bra and purchased ten (10) of them.  Believe it or not, that was over 20 years ago and I still have them.  I work out twice a day and although they are a little worn, they are going strong.  I wash them and hang them out to dry.  I've gotten my money's worth and much more.  Although I still don't need to replace them, I'm thinking about buying new ones -- just because it's been over 20 years since I've had new sports bras.",B000074RL3
"Ladies, you know the drill.  You are an active woman.  You go to the sports section/store and see all the cute little strappy bras designed for runway models for their Pilates classes.  The size XL have bands that are too stretchy and offer no support.  You can't get them off after your sweaty cardio workout.  None of the molded cups even by bra size provided shoulder support for breasts weighing in at 10 pounds and up. We needed wider and supportive shoulder straps! Front  zippers are unreliable...;-/ !  And forget about that two hook adjustment in the back band under the cross straps.  I can't reach behind to make the adjustment...can't pull it on after I have adjusted it.

I competed in silky uniforms that betrayed every bounce.  When I was surfing, paddle boarding, boogie boarding, or water skiing,  active water sport suits provided zero support unless you fell in and had the buoyancy support of the water.  Running, with the most compressive of sports bras,  yielded chafing and heat rashes as well as red marks where the straps cut in.

Thank the universe that volleyball playing Renelle and her mom designed the ""sports corset for the C cup and above"".  Where have you been all my life? This is the one and only sports bra that I will own.  Thank you for all the features, including the wide straps, cross back support, front opening, simplified sizing, and design to keep the girls where they should be without damaging bounces.  I have just ordered the Lite version for everyday use.  Oh, and I have reached a stage in my life when I no longer worry about uniboob...in the Enell, my breasts are where they were when I was in my 20s.

What works for me when putting the bra on:  I connect the first five or so hooks from the bottom and adjust myself in.  Then I finished hooking the rest of the bra.  I couldn't see over the girls to the the first few hooks started. <wink>.

Finally, please get out the fiberglass/plastic tape measure and measure your current band size and the fullest part of your bust to get the correct sizing. Don't guess by your current clothing size.  If you can't find your size, contact Enell.",B000074RL3
"I am a full chested woman who rides horses and runs. There is no bra -let me repeat that -no bra that minimizes bounce like the Enell high impact. Now, if I wear it alone I get uniboob, so I wear a shaped bra underneath it. It's my only judgement -I wish they could make a bra with boob shape that holds as well. But until then this is what I swear by.",B000074RL3
"I have been looking for this product for decades.  Seriously.  I didn't think they made them any more.  I am so awesomely stoked to find this on Amazon.  No more sagging socks for the properly dressed gentleman.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that the clip rubs on the front of my shin, leaving a sore after a few days.  It maybe should have a little more padding on the back.  That may be why this garment went out of fashion.  Nevertheless, Im glad to have found them.",B00007JU0D
I found the men's sock garters to be well constructed and designed. The problem I encountered is the uncomfortable restriction caused by the strong elastic and the painful pressure point caused by the adjustment buckle. I have worn them one time and am not soliciting a refund.,B00007JU0D
"They are very confortable-no rolling. However, have a little problem with hooking them together. I'm using them for heavy socks so having a problem getting to hook to socks but once on they are great. Would be great for light weight socks-not so great for heavy socks.",B00007JU0D
The product is fine.  It is exactly what I expected.  What else can one say about a pair of garters?,B00007JU0D
"Af first, I was skeptical but, then it occurred to me I wouldn't be wasting a lot of money if I didn't like it, so I decided to try them anyway.

Good move. If I knew it, I'd have bought them earlier. Socks stay in place the whole day. For some (unexplained) reason, some days, the metal clip hurts a little (little, I repeat). It's not like ""hurting"", ""hurting"", it's more like there's a 'pressing sensation' on your legs. Maybe it's because, yes, you do have something on your calves...

That shouldn't deter you in any case. The benefit of not having soggy socks on your ankles will compensate the minimum discomfort.",B00007JU0D
"Some things in the past were the best,and if you wanted to keep your socks up you put on your garters and it still hold true to day.",B00007JU0D
"This is a great product, I wear it every day, as a mater of fact I have it on right at this moment, and its been holding up my socks very good, thank you very much, and keep up the good work.  ALOHA1111",B00007JU0D
I bought theses mens socks supports for my father and he loves them,B00007JU0D
"The Mens Sock Garters are fabulous.  I purchased them for my 'senior' father.  He wears them daily, not just for a special occasion. He prefers his socks to be 'completely' up and not sliding down all of the time. He likes the fit around the calf of his leg (adjustable). The garter hook also holds the sock firmly in place. He is very happy with the Sock Garters.",B00007JU0D
Fantastic! It's comfortable and still keeps your socks up.,B00007JU0D
I has been four years since I purchased this garter. I still wear it! Very comfortable and durable. Highly recommend it.,B00007JU0D
My socks no longer sag or slide down my legs and they are comfortable when I use them. The price was very reasonable. These men sock garters were what I needed.,B00007JU0D
"I have never liked how dress socks would fall down to your ankles. Glad these are still made today,

Pros: work as expected, adjustable, comfortable, durable.

Cons: none.",B00007JU0D
"These garters are very adjustable, and easy to use.  They hold the sock up, so I don't have to keep pulling them up.  The fasteners hold socks from thin to medium thicknesses.  These are very nicely made, and will probably last for years to come.
I can't imagine having to go back to life without sock garters!",B00007JU0D
"These are my first pair of sock garters, and I have to say they worked perfectly. I have no issues with them. They are comfortable.",B00007JU0D
"the sock garters work well.

There is one clip on these to grab the sock.

. . . . .",B00007JU0D
"The men's sock garters worked perfectly. No more sagging socks!
color was not an issue so black was perfect for me.",B00007JU0D
"The bra was very hard to put on.  It had to be fastened in the front but then it was too difficult to turn to the back.  Once I got it around, it felt small.  The 3/4 length ended up being too short.  I'm short waisted and thought this would be better than the longer style but it didn't.  The cup size was not as expected.  I normally wear a C cup but this B cup was too big.  I also prefer a slightly padded bra so that the seams don't show through.  Definitely need a front closure so this has to go back.",B0000861QJ
Is the only bra I wear. I have been wearing this bra for more than 20 years. It is comfortable gives me support and good shape.  Is the only 3/4 bra availabe for short people.,B0000861QJ
"The bra is okay and fits fine.  I read in reviews how with longline bras you need to go up a band size and down a cup size in order to get a proper fit.  I picked 40C because I'm normally a 38DD in regular bras.  That gave me the right fit.

The problem with the bra is that with the 3/4 length it rolls up all the time.  It is really annoying to have to keep pulling it back down.  I think it could have been designed better so that it won't roll up.",B0000861QJ
"Poor quality, too big, no support. Would not recommend to anyone. I am not adding additional comments. Additiional words will not be pleasant.",B0000861QJ
I failed to take proper measurements before ordering the produuct. I must reorder.  The BRA was and is exactly the type I need.,B0000861QJ
"I'm Rather disappointed with this product. The cup size is not a regular40.
The bodice is fine but the bra portion of it is a let down.",B0000861QJ
I usually have such a problem getting a bra.  So I tried this 3/4 bra as a gamble.  It was terrific so I ordered another one.,B0000861QJ
"First of all, I want to say that the picture used for this product doesn't do the model or the bra justice.  The picture almost scared me off, but I really really really wanted to find a 3/4 long line bra to wear, so I took a chance and ordered this one.  I am large chested, and my shoulders are started to get grooves from my traditional bras.  I wanted to find a everyday bra that provides a lot of support.  I tried the goddess long line bra, but it is more of a special occasion bra.

The sizing is very strange for this bra.  I normally wear a 36DD, but ordered a 38D, since no larger cup sizes are offered.  Was I ever shocked to find in this bra I would be considered a C cup.  I returned the 38D and believe the 38C will fit me great (I'm still waiting for it to arrive). When I tried on the 38D I couldn't believe how comfortable it was.  Definitely comfortable enough to be an everyday bra.

So all you ladies that normally wear a larger cup size can fit into this bra!  I would suggest ordering a band size larger, and maybe two cup sizes smaller than you normally wear.  I will update when my new one arrives.",B0000861QJ
"I think I may want to wear nothing but long lines from now on! I'm crazy about this bra, but it was too big in both the cup and band. I will return and reorder.",B0000861QJ
I LOVE this bra so much-I'm very short waisted and this hits right at my natural waist. This is the most comfortable longline bra I've ever worn.  I love this for creating a true vintage shape under 30's and 40's clothes.  I bought in white and now I need to get the black and the tan colors as well.  This bra does wonders to create my perfect silhouette comfortably.,B0000861QJ
"Comfortable fit, maybe next order I will drop the size to ""36"".

Thanks,",B0000861QJ
I'm only 5 feet and very short waisted.  The 3/4 length was the perfect length for me.,B0000861QJ
Carabel item .  Sizes are totally incorrect .,B0000861QJ
"Although ordered my size is too small, there is no way for me to stay well",B0000861QJ
"I'm taking it to a cousin in Chile, so I hope it fits!",B0000861QJ
Perfect longline bra for the shortwaisted woman.  Very comfortable with good support.,B0000861QJ
"Good bra for those who are short waisted. Good elastic straps; however, the straps could be slightly larger.",B0000861QJ
"This is good!  Still, can we get three instead of two closing adjusters in the back? Thank you! Love it!!!!",B0000861QJ
"For a full figured bra, it did not fit the midsection at all.  I returned this bra.",B0000861QJ
"It fit around the waist perfectly.  The B cup was about 1/2 inch too big, and I had to sew them 1/2 inch smaller for a better fit.",B0000861QJ
Looks nice but smaller than expected,B0000861QJ
"I bought a band size up and a cup size down as suggested.  Had I bought my usual size it would *definitely* have been too small around.  The cups are a tiny bit small, but not too bad.  They are, however, just as pointy as other reviews suggest.  For wear with vintage clothing ('30's-50's), this is close to ideal for the short and/or short-waisted, but would probably look funny under any but the baggiest of t-shirts. For average height or taller people, this might be too short in the waist to give the right look for close-fitting vintage styles.

If you are about 5' this will probably come all the way down to your waist.  If you are under 5', or under 5'1"" and short-waisted, this will actually be too long.  I'm 5'2"" and short waisted.  With the straps shortened all the way, I can just get away with wearing this.  Halfway through the day, I had to pull it up in the back, because the boning in the back/sides started to rub on my backside and sides.",B0000861QJ
"Sizing way off and not comfortable rolls up a lot  - Having said that, I recommend the Carnival Womens Full Figured Wide Strap Longline Bra - the only issues with this particular bra is that you will have to do a little sewing because the straps don't tighten up enough and order a band size up and a cup or two sizes down.  They size these bra's unusually - but once you find the right fit they are the Full Figured Wide Strap Longline bra is very comfortable.",B0000861QJ
"Fits great, I normally wear a 38D, ordered a 40C and it fits very nicely.  Very vintage look and feel and I love that and so does he,",B0000861QJ
"I love this, but I had to return 2 to get the right size (fit a bit differently than non-longline bras)...will reorder the correct size today - really minimizes ""muffin top!""",B0000861QJ
"36c  cup much too large. had previously worn this size and it was fine. 36b just a little large in cup
the long line should be at least an inch shorter.",B0000861QJ
"Bring a petite woman, the length is prefect.  The only negative is to the department who changed  the price  to be higher than the original typed price on the ticket.",B0000861QJ
She loves them. Even the price was better than expected. She wanted full support and got it.  She said to me awesome.,B0000861QJ
"This bra is great for the bosom endowed with back problems.  I would suggest that you order up one bra size and down a cup size.  I usually wear a 38D but found that a 40C fits me great in this bra.  It gives marvelous support for the back and the ""girls"".  It is comfortable to wear for an entire day and your back will thank you for the purchase. Putting on the bra is done easily. It would have had 5 stars if it was a tad longer.",B0000861QJ
"Sorry it has taken me so long to write this review. They are for my mum who is 82 as she was not well she couldn't wear any bras. Now back on track, mum loves theses, very comfortable and excellent fit.",B0000861QJ
I thought my review was going here. But didn't  see it but I love this 5 star bra. Just wish it hooked in front. Especially if one has shoulder problems.,B0000861QJ
"I have been wearing this particular bra design for many years, and so far have never had any problems.  For the past 10/15 years I have been purchasing them on line as it's impossible to find these, or similar bras in any of the department stores.",B0000861QJ
"The bra was good quality and put together well. The cups were a little bit to large.
I would buy more.
Thank you
Deborah",B0000861QJ
Quite comfortable. Smooths few gyre under stretch fabrics.,B0000861QJ
I was disappointed with the size. It was a bit  small.,B0000861QJ
"This is an extremely well constructed bra, and as I have a short torso, the 3/4 length is absolutely perfect for me. It was a bit small, however, and I just didn't fancy the soft cups. If this had different cups, I would have returned for a better size, as the rest of it was perfect. If you are looking for a longline bra, that is shorter, and don't mind soft cups, this is definitely a bra to try out!",B0000861QJ
This bra is very comfortable and easy to put on.  I like it.  The fabric is soft and it has fairly good support.,B0000862R1
"This bra fits well and is very comfortable.  It is a go-to bra when you want fit and comfort, and aren't concerned with additional ""lift."" It is a great post-surgery bra, with front hooks and eyes. I give it 4 stars because the hooks do come undone while wearing it.",B0000862R1
Had to have breast cancer surgery and the doctors suggested an all cotton front closing bra. This one is ideal. Soft and doesn't rub except where the bandages are to be expected. Since  you have to wear a bra 24 hours a day for two weeks you need something comfortable to sleep in and this one works. Ordered regular bra size.,B0000862R1
"Nice quality fabric , easy hook and eye closure is softer than some of the Velcro options . Runs small, otherwise would have rated 4 or 5.",B0000862R1
"(Size Large c/d) I bought this to use as a sleep bra.  The bra is well made and I like the cotton fabric.  I do not need the pockets, but they serve a useful purpose as a smooth lining which covers the dart seam in the bottom of the cup.  I measured using the instructions and sizing chart at amoena.com, which led me to purchase a larger size than I normally wear/measure.  In this larger size, the bra does not fit as well as I would like.  The band is slightly loose, while the cups are slightly tight, and the bra's overall length is a bit short.  It's OK to sleep in, but I would not use it for day wear.",B0000862R1
Very comfortable and easy to get on and off after surgery since it has a front closure.  Only drawback is that it is high/wide so it shows outside of most clothes.,B0000862R1
I had breast surgery and purchased two of these. Highly recommend. I tried wireless bras first - but they are uncomfortable. If you have to sleep in a bra for any length of time - this bra is the one you want.,B0000862R1
does not fit well - for some reason i pop out the bottom on the right side - I even tried a larger size and had the same problem even though the larger size was too big (which I returned),B0000862R1
Love it. There is no pressure on my shoulders. My back doesn't hurt anymore.,B0000862R1
Perfect fit. Very comfortable to wear all day long after having surgery.,B0000862R1
"Good fit. Product has pockets for inserts so you can put synthetic (or hand-made aka knitted knockers) breast forms into bra. Great for people who prefer to have (or NEED) a front closure. Tag in the back is a bit scratchy, but I have purchased this brand/size/style before and it softens with washing. Obviously, you can also cut out the tag. Wear in good health! I purchased another one so I can have one clean and one in the wash.

FYI: If you purchased this item a few years ago (2014), there were five eye/hook closures in the front, not the four eye/hook closures on the current item.",B0000862R1
"This bra is very comfortable, it runs a little big so order a size smaller than you normally wear.",B0000862R1
"love the feel of the all cotton, no underwire",B0000862R1
"comfort & fit, fabric soft, just very nice bra",B0000862R1
Very comfortable - fit perfect.  A great bra to wear around the house or sleep in and even wear with some casual clothes.  I will be buying more of these!  I plan to use it as a sports bra too!,B0000862R1
"When I asked Amazon customers for suggestions for comfortable, front-close brassieres for an impending breast cancer/reconstruction surgery, they really came through! Thank you, ladies. This bra was a top suggestion. While no bra will feel good after breast surgery, this one was very comforting. It was thin, light, very soft and didn't rub too much. Good for sleeping. It kept everything in place and didn't mess with the drains. It was easy to put on and remove. It has been great for post op checkups/nurse visits  when you have to unveil frequently. I would suggest this bra to anyone who will undergo breast cancer/reconstruction surgery. May I recommend: you might want to consider getting one in black or another dark color to wear in the days immediately after surgery. My white one soon got heavily stained beyond the power of bleach (which is to be expected, its not the bras fault!). The black ones still look like new after many washings and they are so comfortable I plan to keep wearing them after I fully recover. The only downside of the black bra is that some very fine black cotton lint got stuck to the surgical tape residue and steri strip glue which looked extra gross in between showers. Sometimes you cant cant win. Healing wishes and good thoughts to anyone who will take this journey!",B0000862R1
Works with prosthetics just like the $75 bras I received after my mastectomies.,B0000862R1
Nice bra. I needed this bra for support after having breast surgery and the fit is very good. My only complaint is the seams are a little scratchy on my incisions.,B0000862R1
"Thick cotton, nice and with good support. Firm.",B0000862R1
"Provided the perfect amount of firm, yet gentle support after my double mastectomy, as well as for the months of reconstruction that followed!",B0000862R1
"It's fine, I just sent it back because it was too big.",B0000862R1
"Comfortable, but runs small.  I have tried other brands and they all run small, but this one I was able to keep because it wasn't as off size as the others.",B0000862R1
There is absolutely no strap adjustment so the bra keeps riding up towards my chin.,B0000862R1
"soft fabric, wide shoulder straps, not too tight around the chest",B0000862R1
Too small so I returned it. Wouldn't have worked anyway as I needed to add fiberfill breast pads,B0000862R1
"My one remaining boob does not stay in the bra.  It slips out below!  I have never had this happen before, and though the band is comfortable, I don't think it is too big.  Maybe it is just me.  It feels very comfortable until I look in the mirror and see a bulge below the bra!  The straps do not adjust, and I am not sure what to do.  I am 65, and I had a mastectomy when I was 42.  I am 5'2"", 125 pounds.  I am mostly comfortable in 36 bras with a C cup.  I think because by now gravity has overtaken me, and the radiation I received so many years ago has made me a rather odd shape.  I am 10 - 15 pounds heavier than when I had my mastectomy.  So when I say this might just be my experience, these are the reasons why.",B0000862R1
"Shoulder straps too short, the garment rides up!",B0000862R1
"Lovely bra, very comfortable.

Helena Paka",B0000862R1
"I normally wear a 40D.  The large was a little too loose so I exchanged for the medium,  which fits great.",B0000862R1
"Comfortable, supportive, easy to put on after surgery when you can't lift your arms. It is soft with gentle support, so wearing it 24 hrs is not a problem.  The pale lavender print on white is quite attractive.  Will have to see how the support and appearance hold up over time.  My complaint is the price.  There is little difference in the amount of material to make a bra, regardless of size.  The cost of any bra is in the labor to cut and sew the many pieces.  Again, the pieces and sewing are much the same for any size.  Yet this manufacturer charges a premium for the larger sizes.  If you have had breast surgery, you may find that the post-op swelling puts you into a larger size.  This is when some become aware of the size discrimination.  Try the YIANNA for a good bra at a reasonable price.",B0000862R1
Love it. I will be buying another!,B0000862R1
Love it with foam inserts. Light and easy. Will buy again,B0000862R1
Very disappointing.  I'm wondering if this is a knock/off or true amoena bra.  I can't keep it hooked in front.  One day it came off all the hook in front which would have been quite embarrassing if not in my home.  It is a C/D and I normally wear a C.  It also sags rather than holding up prosthetics.,B0000862R1
"very comfortable, it fits as expected. It holds the breast and supports the back. easy to put on, durable material, it does not loose its shape over time. the edges are soft and comfortable.",B0000862R1
Comfortable use it as a sports bra,B0000862R1
"Had to return as it smelled very bad. Chemical smell. Ordered exact same one in white, which didn't Nell - but was too small. Can't win.",B0000862R1
Need to send back. They run very large.,B0000862R1
"I was glad to find a 44B leisure mastectomy bra. Unfortunately it  is too big. I didn't want to send it back, so I washed it in hot water and put it in the dryer. It shrunk a little but not enough. The cup is more like a C cup and my breast forms don't fit the bra properly. I like the fabric a lot.",B0000862R1
This bra is really comfortable and doesn't bother my mastectomy scars. I highly recommend.,B0000862R1
"The bra was way too small, but decided to give it away rather than return.",B0000862R1
Needed the extra bra...fits beautifully.  And at a good price no less!,B0000862R1
"Bought for post partial mastectomy surgery. Super comfortable. Probably not enough compression as needed post-sugery. Runs large. I wear two for more compression, but still comfortable. Have bought way more expensive bras, but this is my go to bra now. Washes and dries well.",B0000862R1
Fits perfectly. Make sure to get your exact size.,B0000862R1
Very comfortable. Reasonably priced.  Pockets to hold prosthesis are adequate.  Fabric is soft and does not irritate scar tissue.  Front closure bra post mastectomy are difficult to find.,B0000862R1
"I love this leisure bra.  I am using this postmastectomy.  It is very comfortable.  The only problem is that it doesn't come with any soft fiberfill ""puffs"" to insert into the pockets and I don't see any way to buy them.",B0000862R1
"I ordered the size 32/34 and it was way to big and riding up. There was obvious gapping in the back where it didn't even touch my skin. Seems the sizing runs large. Aside from the sizing being very off, it did seem good quality and soft. I would say the size small fits more like a 36.",B0000862R1
Not a lot of support but great for after surgery.,B0000862R1
"Not sure if it will shrink a bit after washing but hoping it will just a little. I wish the natural side didn't hang a little lower than the prosthetic side but at my age, that happens. VERY comfortable though and will probably get more of this style.",B0000862R1
Purchased 2...very soft & fit was as expected. Good for sleeping but both came with strong odor like cleaning fluid that was quite difficult to get out of the fabric.,B0000862R1
It rides up. It is a good fit. Not a lot of support,B0000862R1
Love this bra.  Cozy and comfortable.,B0000862R1
"Best mastectomy bra I have ever worn!  So, so comfortable.  For years I would rip off my bra and prosthesis's as soon as I got home because I hated wearing a bra and then, if I had to go to the store, I would have to put the dumb thing on again because I felt funny going out in public.  Not with this bra!  I wear it from the time I get up till I go to bed and don't even feel like I'm wearing a bra!  This is not just a bra for post surgical, but for  everyone who wears prosthesis's.  Thank you Amoena for a comfortable bra!",B0000862R1
Comfortable and is wearing well.,B0000862R1
The very worst purchase i ever made at Amazon. Poorly made.  No size listed. Couldnt even get it clasped. Can not possibly ever wear it. I learned my lesson. Will not buy another bra from AMAZON. Not even one star but had to pick one.,B0000862R1
Comfortable and what I expected!,B0000862R1
"the sides come up pretty high, so if you have an incision, this garment might irritate them",B0000862R1
"It seems to run a little large.  Mostly cotton, the material is very soft and easy to close.",B0000862R1
"Due to my double mastectomy with over 20 lymph nodes removed, I needed a front-closure bra. I don't strain my arms to put this on. It's very comfortable all the way around my chest and back and fits perfectly - which was a pleasant surprise! I've tried other front-closing bras and they feel like armor. I have other battles to fight - I don't need another one!",B0000862R1
Fits perfectly. Great bra for after breast surgery,B0000862R1
It is exactly what I have expected.,B0000862R1
Not designed very well.  Weird fit.,B0000862R1
soft & comfortable  able to wear over suture line immediately post mastectomy  did not roll up as other surgi bra did  would entertain purchasing again once fitted.,B0000862R1
Found the solution to needing a more comfortable bra after shoulder surgery. Will order more and not return to the restrictive prosthesis bra.,B0000862R1
I really like Amoena mastectomy bras but the stretchy material makes it too loose to wear after the first wash. I'm going to try a different  brand  to see if I can get a better fit.,B0000862R1
"Wifey love these bras and she is picky, hates the wire bras.",B0000862R1
What began as a wonderful product--I can't wear it any longer as it continues to ride up.  Not worth the $30.,B0000862R1
I am having surgery in May. I will know more then how benificial it was.,B0000862R1
"Very nice product.  Comfortable to wear post-surgeries, if you can wear colors other than white, also plenty of support for small breasts if you want a comfy, soft t-shirt bra.  I only wish the straps weren't so wide, especially at the bottom, but I can't fault the product as the picture clearly shows them that way.  The problem with it is that it can show under some shirts at the top of the neckline or wherever there is a v-neck or scoop-neck.  But, I love this bra for comfy-clothes days.",B0000862R1
Rides up and is very uncomfortable when it moves over incisions!  Smaller than expected.  I usually wear 36B and this is 36/38 AB.,B0000862R1
In the picture it looks like this has a band underneath to help it stay in place. It does not and so rides up and has to be constantly pulled down. Very annoying and not comfortable at all.,B0000862R1
"This was for post bypass surgery, and has worked very well.",B0000862R1
Smells like chemicals after being washed twice.  Seriously???,B0000862R1
Very soft fabric. Just had a bilateral mastectomy and it has been a great bra to wear during recovery.,B0000862R1
"Uncomfortable, too big, bulky, ill-fitting with inserts.  I didn't care for this bra at all.",B0000862R1
Size was listed as the correct size I wear but slid up on its own easily Very loose,B0000862R1
"I'm post breast augmentation and need a compression bra. This bra is doesn't compress enought, I ordered down a size and still to big and the shoulder straps are not adjustable. I will return it because it isn't what I was looking for.",B0000862R1
Very comfortable post breast-lift.,B0000862R1
"I purchased the medium C/D, based on reviews. I wear a 34DD, and had to reorder a small C/D. I love it for at home or night wear.",B0000862R1
"Soooo comfortable I got 2, but only OK as far as support goes. However, Great sleeping bra (especially post surgical). Great for around the house.",B0000862R1
This the softest front close bra I have tried post mastectomy. The strap length is mercifully  a bit longer than similar fruit of the looms. It is just a tiny bit on the large size for me.,B0000862R1
At first I thought this bra was too big.  Then I realized I felt that way because I didn't feel it pinching me anywhere.  I went the entire day without pulling a strap back up or readjusting it under my arm.  It was so comfortable I didn't think about it at all while at work.  I am buying another one in black right now.  This is a great bra.,B0000862R1
I was not happy with this item and returned it because the elastic on the bottom did not feel secure. I felt the bra itself felt lose on the bottom. The beige color promoted is ore like a light pink.,B0000862R1
great product. comfortable soft,B0000862R1
I'm an older woman with large breasts - had to stretch out the cups with my fist to make it fit better - doesn't seem like a 36 C/D size to me....I also have a problem with it digging into my underarm.... overall it does the job and is more comfortable for wearing around the house than my underwire bra that I wear when going out in public.,B0000862R1
Worked very well after my breast biopsy.,B0000862R1
"Thank you so much, it was like a sigh or real relief to have this new bra.  It fits perfectly.  I am so relaxed in this bra.  I do have a mastectmony and this comforts me more than you can even imagine.  Thank you, truly thank you.",B0000862R1
I used this as a recovery bra after breast reduction surgery (once i was no longer all bandaged up) and it was a very good option. easy to get in and out of as well as open and close when my range of motion wasn't so grand.,B0000862R1
"Way too much variability in size from bra to bra. My wife has ordered 8 of these in three separate orders over the past 4 years. All of these orders were for the same size bra.  Some have fit well, others are way too big.  We had thought that it was perhaps because of stretching over time or shrinkage in the wash. However, we just measured two of the three she just ordered three weeks ago and hasn't yet worn. .  From end to end they vary by over two inches as you can see in the picture! Both are marked as medium. The larger ones are competely unusable. Getting one that fits is a matter of luck.  The variability in size is completely unacceptable.",B0000862R1
"With a broken left arm I couldn't fasten my usual bras. This front closing bra was a comfortable solution. I am able to close the hook/eye series with my right hand doing most of the work. It looks ok under casual clothes, but it is not a support bra. I ordered the m/l expecting it to be too small, but it fits fine. Under a loose tee, it looks like a sports bra. It is comfortable enough to sleep in. I like it!",B0000862R1
"This review is written by Roger's wife - I'm post breast augmentation and need a compression bra. This bra is ok but doesn't compress even though I ordered down a size. Also, the shoulder straps are not adjustable. I will return it because it isn't what I need. It is very soft though.",B0000862R1
Fabric is too heavy but it is comfy,B0000862R1
I just received it today and I am 5 days post surgery. It feels heavenly and gives just enough support. The bras is very soft and does not ride up. I wore a  36B pre-surgery and I ordered a size Medium A/B in this post-surgical bra.,B0000862R1
i am tall and there wasn't enough length in the straps. Kept riding up the back,B0000862R1
"It's a nice bra. I'm 5'1"" and the shoulder straps were too long on me. They are not adjustable.",B0000862R1
"Well, I'm past the deadline to return the bra, and it's my own fault for not wearing it sooner. For me the fit was a little snug and kept riding up. It is the size I wear, so I believe the cut is different. I don't think the bra would have fit if I went up a size. So I would advise any woman buying this bra to wear it right away to make sure it is a good fit.",B0000862R1
I ordered xl myself thinking it would fit even when I knew it was a little big.  Still love it and ordered a large.,B0000862R1
"I love this bra.  The fit is comfortable, and it gives great support.  The front closure is very handy.",B0000862R1
"It was so tight, I couldn't even put it on, and I ordered an extra large size, still didn't fit.  Thew it away",B0000862R1
This is the 4th mastectomy bra I have ordered from Amoena and I have loved them all.,B0000862R1
Would not suggest anyone having surgery order this.  The length was correct the but placement of the arm pits where completely wrong and the rubber was too hard.  Marketed as surgical bra but it wasn't,B0000862R1
"It fit size-wise but it not going to be wearable because the bra is not cut full enough around the front of the arm.  I see it now in the picture.  It's a constant pinch and quite uncomfortable when the arms are extended forward.  If I can't stand to wear it now, it certainly isn't going to work as my support bra after lumpectomy and sentinel node surgery.  Even though it has the pockets for ice packs, it's gong to pinch right where the sentinel node surgery incision will be.  Too bad, waste of money.",B0000862R1
Love it!  Very soft and comfortable.,B0000862R1
Like it and it fits perfectly :),B0000862R1
Comfy.  Easy to clean and easy to wear.  Thick strap and material is supportive.,B0000862R1
"I have one of these in a size small.  Uncomfortably snug and the straps are quite short.  I purchased this one in a medium.  strap length is better, but the bra is very big and too loose.  Band is about an inch too large.  Unfortunately - there is no size between small and medium!",B0000862R1
Good bra and exact fit. Pocket for insert useful during reconstruction.,B0000862R1
So very comfortable and the pockets how useful for after surgery.,B0000862R1
"This bra fit fairly well, and the shoulder straps are comfortable without pressuring nerves in the shoulders. Also it has none of the annoying adjustments that break easily. It has ample room for the breast pads, which fit in easily. The front hooks make donning it easy. Great bra! I hope I can get some others from Amoena of the same style.",B0000862R1
I had breast reduction surgery on 9/15 and this bra has been wonderful to wear while I am healing.,B0000862R1
Excellent bra to buy if having a mastectomy. Very soft and easy to wear. True to size. I bought these in white but ended up getting them in black as well.,B0000862R1
As expected.  Like zip in front.  Comfortable and priced right.,B0000862R1
"Really holding up well. Not much support, but enough.",B0000862R1
This is a great bra. It feels wonderful  and is easy to put on and take off.,B0000862R1
"This is the only bra I where now. Very comfortable--doesn't feel like you have a bra on and covers the nips.  I usually only hook the bottom hook and leave the rest open.  Oh, I didn't like the nude color--too dark.",B0000862R1
I gave this bra 4 stars because it seems well made and I would have kept it but it was simply too big around the band area.  Perhaps I have lost more weight then I realized. :),B0000862R1
Most comfortable and best fitting  wire free bra! I've tried many and this is the best.  Easy off and on with front closure,B0000862R1
"So comfortable,  going into have a lympectomy today and will plan on wearing it home..may have to order more...Im mow 8 days out of surgery. I have worn this bra 24/7..Wore it home from surgery , I already ordered another one. I would really recommend it. I bought it because of the reviews I read.",B0000862R1
Love this bra. I actually ordered another one.,B0000862R1
Very comfortable bra . I used it for post lumpectomy comfort.,B0000862R1
"I bought this bra for a surgery that I ultimately didn't need, and ended up liking it for its comfortable snugness. Great pajama top on a hot night. Will be cute in black or in print.  And you won't bounce around in it if you go running or exercising. Just don't expect it to make you look busty. It's meant to squish you. But -- added bonus --  if you're traveling alone long distance, you could always hide cash in the pockets!",B0000862R1
"The fit is weird. It's so unstructured that I couldn't say whether it's too big or just ....well, weird. I would definitely try a similar bra, and absolutely will make my next purchase front fastening. But I wouldn't buy another of these. The price is very high for what it is. The material, however, is very soft and comfortable. They need to work on fit.",B0000862R1
"Like a sports bra, but not so tight and constricting. Love it.",B0000862R1
"I really do love these bras and own at least 6-7 of them. I wear them as sleep bras.  I'm not sure I would wear them out during the day, just because they are not real supportive, but for smaller chests, they might be good for that as well. My ONLY complaint is the itchy tags in the back of the bra. There are two of them and they are sewn into the bra in such a way that, if you want them completely removed, you have to undo the seam and then sew it back up. I have done this with every single one I have purchased because even the tiniest trace of that tag irritates my skin (the last thing you want while sleeping!). Anyway, I do love them, but I would love them even more if they could do a tag-less version!",B0000862R1
Love these bras!  So very comfortable. Wish they were offered with some padding so it's not obvious when your chilly.,B0000862R1
Soft and true to size. The bra had a weird manufacturing smell that took several several washes to get the scent out.  I used this bra as a post breast surgery bra (four weeks out).  The bra is soft and doesn't irritate the incisions. If you are looking for support this is not your bra.,B0000862R1
These are very nice and comfortable. They don't ride down my shoulders and provide nice support.,B0000862R1
I was searching for a bra to wear after my lumpectomy and for my radiation therapy and this is perfect. It fits well and other reviews convinced me to make the purchase.,B0000862R1
"I purchased this bra for my mom to use after her breast cancer surgery. She went to try it on before her surgery and it was insanely small. Around the torso, not even on the boobs.",B0000862R1
"Very comfortable bra. Not as ""snug"" (as snug as a bra can be...) as I would prefer. Going to try the next size down",B0000862R1
"Haven't had a chance to wear it yet, but sure it will be fine.",B0000862R1
Will reserve comment until I wash it,B0000862R1
"Just as expected, launderers nicely!",B0000862R1
"Comfortable. I'm always pulling my bras down because they ride up under my breasts. Not so with this bra. I wondered if I'd like a front closure with all those snaps. Turns out, I can just slid the bra over my head without worrying about it. I just ordered another one.",B0000862R1
"I bought this to use after my BA.  I tried it on before my surgery and it was just a tad big band wise. I ordered the medium C/D.  I like the fit now after my surgery, but my surgeon would've liked it to be tighter around my chest.  Based on that I give it 4 stars.  Just in case people are looking at this item for a BA.
The fabric is very comfortable and soft.  It is easy to clip the front up.  It keeps the girls down, but not as supportive as sports bras.",B0000862R1
I wish that the cups were a little larger.  I hate the uniboob look.,B0000862R1
"This has made all the difference in my recovery from a lumpectomy.  Great support, soft and comfortable even to sleep in.",B0000862R1
Just received this bra! I'm thankful that Amazon allowed me to send back a previous order because the item was too big. It's hard to order because I found the sizing confusing. These,B0000862R1
"Mom has dexterity issues so it's hard for her to reach back to close a ""regular"" bra. This bra is perfect for her and it fits her wonderfully...",B0000862R1
The most comfortable leisure bra ever!,B0000862R1
"I absolutely love this bra.  I got this to wear after a breast reduction and it is extremely comfortable.  The material is soft and the elastic band is thick enough to provide support but not get in the way of the incisions.  I wear this all day, even to sleep and I love it.  I plan to purchase more!",B0000862R1
"I bought this brand and another for my mother after her mastectomy.
She chose to keep this one.",B0000862R1
Very soft but doesn't stay on at all.  Rides up and doesn't provide me support.,B0000862R1
Nice quality. Runs a little big for me. Not a tight fitting as I hoped,B0000862R1
"Fabric is lighter weight than expected. As a leisure bra, I didn't expect a lot of support but this is close to no support. Runs large. I wear a 38DD & the medium is too big.",B0000862R1
I bought this for my upcoming breast augmentation. It's very comfortable and I look forward to my recovery with this bra,B0000862R1
this is a great product-so comfortable,B0000862R1
Good quality but it could use a little more support.,B0000862R1
wonderful bra my 500g silicone breast forms fit in beautifully together they looked totally real I am going to be ordering more of these bras while amazon has them who knows when I will see them again to order them? I would highly recommend these to anybody looking for a great fitting mastectomy bra! I will be recommend this bra to friends and family for sure!,B0000862R1
Perfect post surgical wear-around -the-house bra. very soft; holds up well after washing. Good for a night bra to sleep in,B0000862R1
"my mom like it ,so soft so comfortable",B0000862R1
Using this bra as a post surgical bra and it is very comfortable and soft as expected. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to wear a bra around the clock.,B0000862R1
"Has kind of a strange odor to it even after I washed it. I only wore it maybe twice, because I needed to wear a tight fitting sports bra after my lumpectomy.",B0000862R1
Just the perfect bra. The closure was a little loose but if you pinch the hooks a little together it holds just fine. It is very comfortable and also fits nicely on the back.,B0000862R1
I love it. It fit so comfortable .,B0000862R1
"Not enough support, will order a smaller size",B0000862R1
"This is the only Amoena bra I've tried that is actually larger than expected. The others I have tried are all super tight with pretty short straps. Not this one at all. So, in that sense, it is really very comfortable. I kind of wish the cotton were a little softer but I'm really into softness. It can also be a bit droopy with inserts in it, due to the loose bottom of the band (... Well, it doesn't really have a band. Just the edge.).
Oh, I like the cut of the arm holes. They don't dig into my underarms. Overall, a good leisure bra.",B0000862R1
Had to get front closure bra for lumpectomy and targeted balloon radiation.. these bras were comfortable for sleeping and yet gave great support!,B0000862R1
"I had to return first one for a smaller size, which seems to fit quite good.",B0000862R1
I am reviewing this 6 months after I bought it. I used this after my mastectomy and it was so comfortable. I now use a regular bra during the day still use this to sleep in. It stands up to washing and drying in my washer/dryer very well. I bought a S c/d and my usual bra size is 34c.,B0000862R1
This bra was perfect! I had a lumpectomy and this bra holds the breast in place without squishing too much. This bra is also perfect to sleep in.,B0000862R1
Its probably my fault as I thought I would be a medium after reduction.  The bra is very soft and I do wear it sleeping but leave a few hooks unhooked.  It hits right where the stitches are so needs a bottom band of some type.,B0000862R1
This bra is comparable to others I've seen for twice the price,B0000862R1
"after washing in cold water fabric shrunk some, not happy with this product",B0000862R1
"Great bra for around the house and sleeping, comfortable with some support.",B0000862R1
Love these bras! Very comfortable and well constructed.,B0000862R1
Very comfy. After surgery it was comforting and supportive to wear. Soft fabric.,B0000862R1
"Fit pretty snug, bought it to wear after breast lift surgery. Started to hurt underneath where my stitches were. Became really uncomfortable after I started to swell. Maybe a bigger size?",B0000862R1
For the price I paid for it very worth it! Especially for the night ;),B0000862R1
amazing to use under your compression bra!!!!,B0000862R1
Unfortunately it just didn't fit but it would have been comfortable. Nice material no support at all.,B0000862R1
"6 weeks ago I had a double mastectomy.  This bra has been a life saver!  very soft and non irritating.  I've ordered 2.  Not as much support as I would like for daytime, but perfect for sleeping and lounging at the house.",B0000862R1
"This product fits perfectly as purchased by the size chart. It is extremely well made. The fabric feels very comfortable against your skin. I'm going back to buy more. I have bought these type of bras by different manufacturers and this is the best one I've purchased, the price is exceptional. Give one a try!",B0000862R1
"All of my life, I have detested bras.  They were uncomfortable, and I was always having trouble keeping the straps up.  This bra is so comfortable on, I forget I am wearing one.",B0000862R1
I have 4 of these and they are the best. I got them after my surgery. That was almost a year ago. This is my 5th one. Amazon has a much better price. I got the others from Nordstrom.,B0000862R1
"Bra band measured 30"" and when stretched to 32"" was uncomfortably tight.",B0000862R1
I love it but way to large and straps bring prosthrsis down too far . Not enough support...,B0000862R1
I think the large was meant for a full busted woman. I am just regular large.,B0000862R1
"Soft,comfortable,  and fits perfectly.",B0000862R1
"This was soft and nice, but way too big.  So it was returned for the camisole shelf bra which I had also ordered.",B0000862R1
"Simple comfort! I purchased due to a shoulder condition which made a back closer excruciating. Works like a charm, but fits well and very nice to wear.",B0000862R1
Beautiful bra! Comfortable fit. Bought this bra for my mom as a post double mastectomy bra. She was able to comfortably wear this bra right after surgery! I had Velcro drain holders from another Amoena bra that fit on this bra as well.,B0000862R1
"Very nice bra. Fits well. I like the nude color. I like that it's cotton. Washes well. Hooks easily. Nicely made. Reasonably priced for the value you get. Serves my purpose well (post-surgery, including sleeping). The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the inside seems are a little scratchy for my sensitive skin. (Amoena's ""Hannah"" model has very soft seems inside and out.) Otherwise, this bra is as comfortable as they come. Thank you.",B0000862R1
"I needed this bra to be amazing but it was very itchy.  I could not wear it as much as I wanted to and it was a bit big for me as well.  I did love the inside pockets made for ice packs, that was super helpful.",B0000862R1
Perfect for post breast surgery.  Comfortable enough to sleep in while providing good support.,B0000862R1
"Because of the way the sizes run, it's hard to say how the fit was.  I'm normally a 42D and the large runs 40/42 and C/D.  I ended up ordering the next size up and an XL fit good,.",B0000862R1
I purchased this bra to use after both a biopsy and lumpectomy.  I love the softness of the material and lack of irritating seams.  Front hooks were brilliant and worked great.  The pocket was perfect for holding my ice packs.  My only problem is that any bit of jiggle hurts and this bra just doesn't have enough support and compression to prevent that.  Not sure if I should get a smaller cup size or just find another bra.,B0000862R1
"I bought a couple of these bras for my early post-mastectomy days, and loved them. The material is soft, the bra's construction is kind to my port site, and it is comfortable for all day wear or as a sleep bra. They are a favorite of mine.",B0000862R1
I bought this for my mom who has arthritis.  She had difficulty with the large number of fasteners so she just slips it over her head without detaching it.  It is all cotton and fits well.  The elastic allows for a comfortable fit.,B0000862R1
I exchanged it for a small instead of a medium and it fits great,B0000862R1
"Is very comfortable, easy to put on",B0000862R1
I love the front closure on this bra--makes putting it on very convenient. It is comfortable and holds the prosthesis in its pocket so that my bust looks normal.,B0000862R1
I bought these for ease of wearing  with a port. I am looking for support to keep the port secure and the front closure helps from having to stretch and twist too much.,B0000862R1
Best bra ever. Received my first one during breast lump removal.. Most comfortable easy to fasten love love love,B0000862R1
"Bought these for my sister who recently underwent surgery. By far the best quality of four brands she tried. Wide straps for support, wide bottom band - very comfortable!",B0000862R1
Just what I needed post breast operation. One suggestion: put the label elsewhere. It irritated my skin and I had to cut it off.,B0000862R1
"I ordered these bras after undergoing a lumpectomy for breast cancer. Being of a certain age, I had never worn a sports bra, but it was recommended for support and comfort after the procedure. I ordered L for daytime, XL for nights. Both have been very comfortable and provided the gentle support I needed without  lots of seams and tightness.  The material is very soft and gentle to the skin. Although the label says ""Hand Wash'"" I am wearing 2/24 hours and always want a clean one to put on, I have been washing them on the hand wash cycle with a gentle detergent in my washing machine and drying them with towels or nightgowns on the extra-low setting of my dryer. The thick material makes for slow air-drying. The material actually feels softer after this washing process. The only complaint I have about these bras is the label, which is sewn in to the center back seam. Before cutting them out, the ends of the label caused itching; after cutting them out as close to the line of in-seam stitches as I could, the edges rub and itch. PLEASE print the label onto the fabric as in all my other regular bras. But thanks for a great product for my special needs.",B0000862R1
Excellent fit.  Very comfortable.  Stays in place.,B0000862R1
I bought this bra because I had breast cancer surgery. I was a 36G. Now I'm a 36 DDD and this bra is a little too big. I only took off one star because I really like this bra. It is a very nice soft material . It's comfortable. It's easy to get on and off. I do wish it fit better. But that's the risk I took for ordering online,B0000862R1
Cups are a bit too large for a dual- sized bra.  Otherwise great.,B0000862R1
"Nice comfortable sleep bra.  I am rather large busted and with this bra there is a small amount of
security.  I like to wear it when I am in my jammies, but not ready for bed.  A little more ""privacy"".",B0000862R1
Too large which in turn gives little support.,B0000862R1
I am always in search of the perfect bra.  One that does not trap heat and sweat.  Still working on it.,B0000862R1
"I am very happy with this purchase!  So much so that I just ordered another bra!  It is extremely comfortable and fits just right.  I have not had any problems with the fit (I thought it might be too small but some of the reviews said it ran big, so I ordered the smaller of the two choices and it was the correct decision.  I also have not had any problems with the front hooks coming undone.)  With arthritic shoulders, it has become very difficult for a back hook bra and this is very easy to get on.  I also needed a bra without underwire right now and this one is super comfortable.",B0000862R1
Good bra for Lounging and sleeping,B0000862R1
"I bought several of these to wear post breast reconstruction surgery. They are very comfortable, and the support is great. In fact, my plastic surgeon says they are great. Recommended!",B0000862R1
This is my go to bra after my surgery. Comfy and supportive.,B0000862R1
Well made- comfortable- great for surgery! Runs small. made well!,B0000862R1
leaves ridge marks on your skin,B0000862R1
Love the front closure and so soft,B0000862R1
"one of the most comfortable bras I've had, the only issue I have with it is how wide the straps are and the amount of fabric for the back - great under the average shirt or T shirt, not good for shirts with a boat or lowish V neck",B0000862R1
This was for my mother who is legally blind and has some peripheral neuropathy. She was able to fasten it without assistance and she likes the fit. I am ordering two more for her.,B0000862R1
I bought this for my mother who is 75. She absolutely loves it and wants me to buy a few more.,B0000862R1
This bra is lovely and soft! It is a very high quality and very well made.  It does not irritate my incisions.  I ordered it before my breast surgery --breast conserving with extensive reconstruction on both sides and it did seem big compared to the sizing information. This ended up not mattering as there was enough stretch that it still worked fine being a little big. I have reordered a size down and that is perfect but I still use the larger one too.,B0000862R1
"The most comfortable front-closure bra! Why more manufacturers don't make these, I will",B0000862R1
This bra is well made and delicate looking.  The fabric is soft and silky feeling while still being strong.,B0000862R1
Perfect fit for what I need it for!,B0000862R1
"This bra is my favorite of the bunch I bought post-lumpectomy and here's why:
-It's a little bit bigger than you'd expect, so it's not too tight for your tender boob OR if you have a drain. Too tight would block the tube.
-The cups are double layered so they can hold an ice pack in place. This was a GREAT feature
-The hook and eye closure is easier to do when your arm is sore than a zipper. I thought for sure I'd want a zipper, but ended up liking this instead.
-The sides come down low enough so that if you've had Axillary Node Dissection, the bra isn't rubbing on your wound
-While it's a bit loose, it is still sturdy enough to handle a large chest

This is also the only mastectomy bra carried in-store at my Nordstrom in LA, so that also tells you something. It's $32 there, so a bit cheaper here on Amazon (I think I paid $30).

The only negatives:
-The white gets dirty easily, especially if you're leaking. You'll need at least 2 so you can alternate washing them.
-The hook and eyes tend to come open while wearing it. It's been just the bottom 2 so far, which I don't even notice until I go to take it off.

Highly reccommed!",B0000862R1
Had reduction surgery and this was the perfect recovery bra.  Super comfortable!,B0000862R1
"I have purchased these bras before, and I like them because they are so comfortable.",B0000862R1
Easy to wear after have multiple biopsies and then lumpectomy and node removal.  Am able to wear while sleeping.  Incision under arm sometimes is uncomfortable.,B0000862R1
"This is an excellent bra for use after a lumpectomy. Very soft and comfortable, and gives proper support while healing. This bra closes in the front, which is something very necessary after this type of procedure.  You will not be able to put on a normal bra for 2-4 weeks after surgery, especially if you have nerve damage.  Also has pockets for ice packs and can hold your drain in if necessary.  This ran a little bit big on me, but still gave proper support. Cannot stress to you how important that is after this type of surgery.  You do not want anything tight fitting. I highly recommend this product for anyone going through this.  I wish someone had told me about these type of bras pre-surgery.  I would have been better prepared.  I got this a week after my surgery and so wished I had it sooner!",B0000862R1
"Worked fine for a while, but as the doctor did my expansion, the bra was too stretchy and less supportive, causing some pain and achiness in the breast with the chest expander.",B0000862R1
This works as expected for my mother who has trouble getting her clothes on at age 95.,B0000862R1
I got this bra for my mom and she seems to love it.  I need to order her another one... good reminder.,B0000862R1
These are so comfortable through surgery and radiation.  Just a little big - order your size and don't go bigger.,B0000862R1
"I bought the medium A/B cup model, but the cups were more like a C. The chest circumference is pretty big, too, and it's not adjustable.",B0000862R1
I think I will like this bra when I can get. The right size.,B0000862R1
I bought these for my Mother who just had a lumpectomy with lymph nodes removed. I chose this one because of all the great reviews. She is a 32b and said it fit perfect and is very comfortable all day and to sleep in as well. She was quite pleased for the surprise gift.,B0000862R1
Comfortable and fit fine. Would buy more if I needed to.,B0000862R1
"does not have any way to adjust the straps, I returned this product",B0000862R1
"A perfect bra, especially if you have any shoulder restrictions as it us a front closure bra. Amoena makes quality products, and is worth the price.",B0000862R1
Wonderful post-mastectomy bra.  I had three surgeries and six months of reconstruction.  These bras have been incredibly comfortable.,B0000862R1
"This is a Great Post Lumpectomy Bra.  It was very comfortable to wear at night and during the day.  The side area in low enough that it didn't rub on my under arm incision.  I was able to wear it with my drain and I pinned it to my strap and this worked very well.  I really liked the front closure, because it made it very easy to get on after surgery.  I am a 38D and it gave me enough support.  I plan on wearing it during my radiation therapy.",B0000862R1
Too large and not enough support.,B0000862R1
good quality. but runs a little bit large,B0000862R1
Lots of stretch.  Can put on over head so don't have to hook all those hooks.,B0000862R1
"Twelve years ago, I had breast cancer complete with a mastectomy, chemo and radiation. Since then, I've tried several different brands and styles of bras all to no avail. All of them were very uncomfortable so I have endured the discomfort for twelve years. I could not be more pleased with my new Amoena bra. It is so comfortable I don't feel like I even have a bra on. I only bought one thinking it, too, would probably be uncomfortable. Now I'm ordering more. Also, I really like how easily it fastens in the front. Thank you so much Amoena!",B0000862R1
"At my normal 42D, it was a snug fit but still comfortable.  Even the smallest amt more and it would have been too small. I bought mine to wear post lumpectomy and the softness and style was comfortable for the first 48 hrs with the drain tucked into the front as a do it yourself solution instead of taping.  Well made and good strap and back placement.  Altho I will not need a prosthetic, the pocket gives me a place to slip a layer of foam or fleece to add protection while the surgical site continues to heal.  I feel that gives me added safety when playing with my young grandchildren and pets.",B0000862R1
"soft and comfortable.  I am wearing this bra about a month after reduction surgery so I still a little swollen.  I ordered this bra 2 sizes larger and I am happy with the fit and feel.  There is an adjustable front so sizing is not an exact measurement.  It is a compression type bra so it is meant to fit snug.  if you don't like that, simply order a larger size.",B0000862R1
"I have a suggestion for women having bilateral mastectomies - I had mine 2 months ago. Buy several of these bras in different sizes BEFORE you have surgery, and just return the ones which aren't comfortable. ""Comfortable"" is generous word - they are tight and offer compression, i.e. keep you tight and the dressings/drain tubes in place. Not a pretty picture but it is necessary.  Purchase bras from different manufacturers too - the Carefix Bella is another option.  They all fit differently and I also suggest you go up a size to allow for swelling and dressings post-op.",B0000862R1
"I had a partial mastectomy and lymph node removal on my left side. I found this bra to be easy to put on and it fits well, considering I had swelling on one side.  I really like the all cotton material with only elastic only where needed. I highly recommend this bra for any lady who appreciates a comfortable fit and material, regardless if a breast cancer patient or not.
Thank you!",B0000862R1
It is comfortable and the front closure makes it easy to get on.,B0000862R1
The quality is very good. The only thing I don't like is that it soes not have a nice fit that we need post surgery. But is easy to put on on take off.,B0000862R1
Nice bra. I have had a double mastectomy and it works well with the breast forms I bought oon Amazon,B0000862R1
"I got it for the front fastening ( broken arm).  Hard to fasten.  No support.  I would return it, but it's too much trouble.",B0000862R1
I would recommend trying it out because you will have to have a breast form in one or both sides.,B0000862R1
Dont care much for the beige color. that is my taste. was hoping for a style that was not big and so much matterial. the edge of the bottom is a lettles scratchy. I have one I got from my surgeon that has elastic (on the bottom of bra) covered with knit bra material  which is much easier to have against the areas that are healling up.,B0000862R1
JUST HAD IMPLANTS INSTALLED AND CAN NOT WARE AN UNDERWIRE BRA.  THIS ONE IS SO COMFORTABLE.  I LOVE IT,B0000862R1
I love the front closure.  This item fits as expected and is light and not binding at all.  It is comfortable as my skin is very tender from surgery and current radiation.  I do not have a prosthesis at this point but am using old bathing suit fillers in the pockets and it works perfectly and is not the least bit uncomfortable. May wear this until I have recovered from radiation before switching to a prosthesis and mastectomy bra.,B0000862R1
The bra seems well made but I would recommend buying it a size smaller than you usually wear. I took mine up in the back and hope that will make it fit better.,B0000862R1
I had a double lumpectomy and I tried several bras. This one is the best. Very comfortable and supportive. It can be worn with comfort for sleep following surgery. Fits true to size.,B0000862R1
"Had a mastectomy and lymph node dissection 5 weeks ago, and this provides enough coverage to be comfortable.  The pockets are also great, so I can use a little padding to balance myself out while the expander is in for reconstruction (of course, there isn't much I can do about sagging on the other side, but this helps overall).",B0000862R1
"Looking for light weight, well fitting. Bulky and thick feeling . Still can't find a comfortable, attractive mastectomy bra.",B0000862R1
Bought to use after breast surgery and could not wear bras with underwire.  Fit was comfy not real flattering but did work for me.,B0000862R1
This bra was recommended to me by a friend who also had a lumpectomy. It is a mastectomy bra. Why it is good immediately following lumpectomy it has pockets in the cups perfect for placing an ice pack to keep the swelling down. An amazing feature for the ice pack will fit exactly where you need it! You do not need to hold the ice and the ice is not directly on the skin. It was a lifesaver for me. I bought this bra in my regular size that I need for a wire bra.,B0000862R1
The bra was to large.  The straps took up much of my shoulder and showed inside my collar line.  I have a Greta bra model that I thought looked like the one I ordered.,B0000862R1
"I had a mastectomy on one side two months ago, and have an expander in for reconstruction. During this phase, I cannot wear a regular bra. I ordered one of these to try it out, and it is perfect! It is exactly the right fit. It is soft and stretchy, so it fits both my ""normal"" breast and my ""in-process"" breast well, even as the one changes shape and size. The front closures make it easy to get in and out of. I love it and will no doubt order more.",B0000862R1
"This is a very comfortable bra. I had a double mastectomy with tissue expanders in December. I looked at regular bras and they were not comfortable, These bras are so comfortable.  Love them.",B0000862R1
"It fit as expected, my aunt said. It comes with several colors.",B0000862R1
Bought this front clasp sporty bra after surgery as it's very similar to the one the hospital gave me.  Very comfortable yet not t-shirt thin.  Has a nice strength to it.  I love mine and the clasps support it well.,B0000862R1
"The fit is just a bit smaller than expected, but not enough to send it back. The comfort is wonderful. This works great for those of recovering from a breast lumpectomy!",B0000862R1
"If you are already a DD or expanding to a DD+, this is the best compression bra I've found, and I've tried a lot of them. I found I was happiest ordering one band/cup size larger than I currently am. I get that we need compression post surgery, but geez, these things can get uncomfortable fast. The only thing odd about this bra is they put a tiny seam where your nipple is/would be, so if your shirt is tight it looks a bit like you are ""at attention."" Still, for comfort and price, this is my immediate post-surgery go-to bra.",B0000862R1
"The center connection clasps are a little bit scratchy for me. So I can't use it as a ""sleeping bra"". It is ok for wearing around the house. It does not provide much support for me as I have a bit more up top, so it is for casual use only for me.",B0000862R1
"Good fit, washes well, nice stretch, great for mastectomy patients..has pockets in the cup for prostesis",B0000862R1
Great seller.  Great product. Exactly as stated.  A+,B0000862R1
"Great fit and easy closure in front after mastectomy.
Wish it was machine washable.",B0000862R1
"The front eye closures did not stay together from the moment I put this on. No support whatsoever either. I  mean, really no support. Can't imagine anyone wearing this for anything other than sleep and even then they better check the clasps!",B0000862R1
"The best bra I've found. I am a 50b, which is a hard size to find. Very flattering and the straps stay up well.",B0000866GL
Fits well and is comfortable.  Wish they had same bra with opening in FRONT!,B0000866GL
"I measured myself correctly according to Lady Grace's site.  I'm sure it's just one of those things where everyone's body is different, but I had to have a seamstress friend reduce the cup size for me.  The straps won't stay up to save my life, so that's the big problem.  Otherwise, the sides hold up well with the stays and are very wide.  It's only mildly uncomfortable in terms of the fabric not being soft enough.  They discontinued this bra.  Grab one if you can find one online somewhere!",B0000866GL
"Nice quality bra, it was just too small for me!",B00008624J
I bought the wrong size. No ones fault but mine. I will probably order again and just order a different size.,B00008624J
Bra fit very well.  Would buy again.,B00008624J
Great to be able to order bras that fit over the internet,B00008624J
"After heart surgery, I could not use my regular underwire bras and needed some which were not so constricting. These bras are big enough not to irritate the wound.",B00008624J
The sides hurt under the arms wish you would do something about it hope u can help reach me by mail thanks again prtay,B00008624J
Best price and this are real difficult to find  my cousin love this she had been using this brand since 19 years ago,B0000862B7
helps the back feels great  happy to have purchased i p[lan to buy other colors price is great  i am very pleased,B0000862B7
"reorder the bra now it fits perfectly,so I guess I gain a few more pounds, always thought it went to my hips. I was wrong.",B0000862B7
Fantastic fit! And the price is great! I have been wearing this style for about 3 years and have spent $50.00 online price was $35.00. I highly recommend it. Shoulder straps could be wider they tend to cut into my shouldershowever I change the straps which is worth it for me because the fit is wonderful.,B0000862B7
This bra does not have enough support especially with the narrow straps and very hard to adjust the straps. The longline Bali bra was the best. I wore the Bali bra over 20 years. The only thing I disliked about the Bali bra was that the metal stey would sometimes break. I noticed tthat in the past few years that  the elastic straps seemed not as strong.,B0000862B7
"This is a wonderful solution for fuller figures, as the pointy shape provides a flattering look.  Anyone looking for a Mad Man figure should consider this piece of equipment.  As comfort goes, this is fairly comfortable, but you definitely feel being held by it, as the fabric is sturdy on the sides.  My only complaint is that mine came mislabeled - I ordered 36 and got 38 with a paper tag that said 36.

Well, it worked anyway, and I was too lazy to return it.

Unlike other, more contemporary alternatives, this is going to last forever - I have an old one that I wore for ages.

Highly recommend it.",B0000862B7
"Creeps up, the cups are HUGE with a very weird shape. The girls are lost in the cups. The minute I moved, the band flipped up over my rib cage. Almost grabbed the scissors to cut myself out of it so I could breathe. Oh well, first attempt at this type of bra, obviously not for me. The well-endowed may find this OK, though.",B0000862B7
"I've been trying to find a replacement for the Goddess 1304.  Thought I'd try this bra because it seems similar enough. I'm not too impressed. I don't think this is a bad bra. I just don't think it suits my needs.  Here's why:

I have back fat. I need to flatten said back fat. While it sort of did that, it created a whole new roll of back fat above the band. The band seemed be lower in the back. However, I compared it to my other bras and the band seems the same width and shape, so I don't know.  I didn't have the luxury of trying before I bought.  Admittedly, the issue might just be that I bought a size too small. Just mentioning it in case any other women with a similar body issue were thinking of purchasing. If you can, definitely try before you buy to make sure.

My main issue, however, is the straps. They just don't get tight enough. I shortened them as much as they would go, and it just wasn't enough.  I was visibly sagged in the front. If I can reach up and tighten straps with my hands and lift my girls, it's not a good thing. I didn't think it was very supportive. If you need a tighter strap to keep yourself up, I would not go with this bra.",B0000862B7
I really love these carnival women's camisole,B0000862B7
This is very poorly made and the shape it gives isn't flattering. The stiching is horribly done. Before the first wash it was coming undone. After the wash the wires were out. Cheap quality.,B0000862B7
The size is right but it give you those annoying madonna torpedo boobs :( the shape is very unnatural,B0000862B7
"This bra is great for what I wanted it to do. It's not too tight or too heavy and it holds my hernia as well.
However, if there is any way you could notify me when I could get this in a 3/4 size instead
of longline I would appreciate that.",B0000862B7
They shud make camisole wth soft material. I could not get it on very ancanfterbal I returned it,B0000862B7
Hv been wearing these for 40 yrs. still high quality and comfortable,B0000862B7
Carnival before was excellent in size cups etc but now  the size of the cups is not according to the size indicated the cups in the previous carnival in1988 was excellent but it desappear in mexico city later i hope that carnival can produce wxcellents bras like before,B0000862B7
this is the best thing i could buy i cannot stop taking about the fit hold me togather,B0000862B7
"It fit as I expected, but it has a cut in the band part I did not like that part and it is very comfortable.",B0000862B7
Terrible!! The style was sold as front fastening but was BACK fastening instead. One would either need to be an contortionist or require a maid to assist as did Scarlet O Hara.  I do not trust Amazon to replace it correctly so will have  to search elsewhere. I am very disappointed and angry.,B0000862B7
Looks better in the picture. I may have received some old dead stock. No underwire like I thought it would have some. The cups were baggy and I ordered my usually size. Don't like and are planning to return.,B0000862B7
"This does exactly what it's supposed to do - hold me in and give me good support. However, I couldn't give it 5 stars only because it DOES exactly what it's supposed to do and, as expected, it's a bit uncomfortable while it's doing it! I expected that, however, and I was right. But a bit of discomfort is, in my opinion, part and parcel of being a female who has a bit of bulging where she doesn't want it and still wants to get into that special occasion dress without bulging. So if you agree, go for it.",B0000862B7
REMOVE THIS INFORMATION FROM YOUR WEBSITE. SOME PURCHASES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE SHARED WITH STRANGERS.,B0000862B7
It make me feel Confidence to myself,B0000862B7
there was wires in it and it was a little small did not like it as much as the Fully bra i get all the times,B0000862B7
"The elastic band was very lose
I'm disappointed with the fit",B0000862B7
I like the bra. I would like to have more support in the armpit.,B0000862B7
it feels lie an out outfit and runs big,B0000862B7
Doesn't hold my stomach in enough and cups are a little too big.,B0000862B7
"I don't usually think of Amazon when I need some lingerie but this time I did and I was delighted with my purchase.  It is difficult to find a full length slip at a department store but Amazon had just what I wanted.  The length, the material and the stretch straps fit perfectly.",B0000865SC
"Just the right length, good quality.  Note though that proper sizing matters for this item as it is not adjustable.",B0000865SC
Love this slip. great quality and I love the wide stretch strap. The strap stays in place better than any slip you can find.,B0000865SC
"I love this slip! I bought this slip more than 5 years ago and it is still as good as it was when I bought it! This is the most comfortable slip I have ever worn, it is soft, silky feeling, and wears very well! The straps are non binding and do not fall down, they are made of a very soft stretchy material so they are not bothersome like most slip straps. I have been trying to find this slip again so I can buy it in both the shorter and the longer version, as well as a dark (black) color. I would recommend this slip to everyone!",B0000865SC
"I absolutely love this slip. I am a size 38 D in the chest and and 5'2 and about 200lbs. I was worried about the sizing of this slip because I have never ordered one online before. I ordered a size 42 and it fits perfect. It has good length to it, just below the knees and is very silky and comfortable. The thing that I love most about it are the straps. Because they are lace I thought it would feel like lace but it doesnt. It actually is made from a stretchy material so it shapes to your shoulders and doesnt get itchy like most lace does. I plan on buying more of these in the future.",B0000865SC
My purchase of these slips was a few years back. They have held up nicely. Material is still soft and silky. Survived many washings and stull performs well.,B0000865SC
Overall nice just not loose enough for me.,B0000865SC
It is so difficult to find this style of under garment in the department stores.  I took a chance and ordered it and was extremely pleased.  Good quality and perfect fit.  Now my outer layer looks and feels wonderful because of this under layer. Couldn't be more pleased.,B0000865SC
Just what I wanted and will order a larger one!,B0000865SC
"Great slip. Perfect because it's not made with hot, stretchy material that most women's under garments are made with now.",B0000865SC
I couldn't be happier with this classic slip. It feels like silk and makes me feel feminine and my skirts now look crisper and free flowing.,B0000865SC
shadowline has always been very good. fit great,B0000865SC
"It was beautiful, but if your midsection is also large then forget it. I'm a 42E so the size to fit the top should allow for the rest of your body, right? Nope. Had to return.",B0000865SC
"Love the slip, but size runs small. Not returning it, giving it to a friend",B0000865SC
"This is my third Shadowline Stretch Lace Strap Full Slip!  I have one of each available length, and they are all GREAT and PERFECT SLILPS!!!  I love how the under arm area has elastic so that it doesn't balloon out under a dress.  The lace straps are very comfortable.  I only wish that shadow line made slips at 30"" or 32"", for formal gowns - I would buy them in a second!",B0000865SC
"Fits perfectly, and great length.  Straps do not slip off my shoulder.  Just what I was looking for.",B0000865SC
Smaller through the body with no extra fabric but fit close to the body which was okay.,B0000865SC
larger than I expected straps a little flimsy probably not going to hold up well,B0000865SC
Exactly what I was looking for!,B0000865SC
"Straps do not adjust and my right one keeps slipping down. Otherwise, it is great!",B0000865SC
What more does one need from a slip?  It fit and is comfortable.,B0000865SC
It fits fine. Very comfortable to wear as sleepwear. Although they are not adjustable I do like the wider straps. I will buy more.,B0000865SC
"REALLY like this slip! Nice fit, and the shoulder straps don't move! Wore it under a velour dress yesterday that sometimes has a static cling problem, but had no trouble at all. Nice fabric. Will buy this for my daughters. I'm a pretty average size, and it works for me!",B0000865SC
well my wife was looking for a full slip for a while got her this one she loves it might have to buy her another one cause she loves it very much,B0000865SC
"This is the perfect slip to wear under merino knit dresses!  There is no extra - and lumpy! - fabric around the bust, which shows through knits - a problem I have with my silk slips!  The length is just right for the better knit dresses, as well. I LOVED the white slip so much that I just bought the same slip in black  This is One Great Slip!
UPDATE:  I ordered this black slip 2"" shorter than my white slip, so that it fits under most of my skirts and dresses!  These slips are SUPER!  Time to buy ANOTHER one - in beige, this time!!!",B0000865SC
"Very Light weight, slightly loose fitting but comfortable, straps don't slip, you forget you are wearing it.",B0000865SC
I wear a 38D bra so I ordered the slip in 40.  If fit perfectly.  Very comfortable.,B0000865SC
Fit perfectly ordered by bust size. I wear mine under everything and to bed and lace straps stay in place. Love it so much i ordered another.,B0000865SC
"This is a great slip if you can get the right fit. I had to order slightly larger than my actual size. It's slightly stretchy so if it's a little small, it still works, but if it's too large, it buckles, folds, and puckers in an unflattering way under smooth fitting dresses.  It's surprisingly comfortable and cool for a synthetic slip -- I was able to wear this in 90+ degree weather and I HATE being hot. It also makes a decent nightgown in a pinch. Check the inside label when you get your slip if it doesn't seem to fit right -- I was sent the wrong size (the invoice had the right size but the inner label showed it was a size  larger, which I didn't notice until after I'd washed it).",B0000865SC

"I placed an order for two Shadowline full slips which, according to the description and photo, were supposed to be virtually identical to those I have owned and been very happy with in the past.  When the slips arrived, I found that they were sold by Dixie Belle, not Shadowline, and had been assembled in Mexico.  They were too small for the marked sizes and looked and felt skimpy.  The lace used in the straps was coarse and scratchy.  I am very disappointed with this product, which in no way meets the standard of quality of the Shadowline brand.",B0000865SC

It is very nice just a little snug.,B0000865SC
"The quality vs price were acceptable.  I found the sizing to be off, the slip runs small. Assuming the  sizing label was accurate, I  would recommend ordering a size (normal fit) or two larger than usual ( if you like a looser fit). For a good basic slip, this is a good choice.",B0000865SC
Difficult to find in my size at department stores.  Suggest ordering one size down unless you like it a bit snug. Perfect for me.,B0000865SC

"It is so hard to find full slips to wear under maxi dresses and I am happy to have purchased this item.  The material is soft and smooth and it does not twist on you. Now I need to find this same slip with a plunging rounded neckline. The V shape will show on dresses that have a lower  rounded neckline. Everything else is perfect and the slip helps in smoothing out your contour under clingy dresses.  I am 5'8,  180 lbs and size 40 fits perfectly.",B0000865SC

Ordered 1 but have already ordered two more. Just like the vintage french slips I got from the 60's.
Am 5ft 11 and the dress is knee long",B0000865SC
"I had a hard time trying to find a slip that fit, love this.",B0000865SC
"I made the mistake of ordering the slip in a size larger based on some of the reviews I read, and it hangs on me a bit more than I'd like. One size smaller (so my normal size for a slip) would have probably been just right, but I can still make this work. Great slip otherwise!",B0000865SC
I am 5'1 and weigh 120 lbs- I got the 34-24 and it fits perfectly. It hits about an inch lower than my knee and isn't too tight or too loose. The material is as expected and stretchy. This is a great buy.,B0000865SC
Wonderful product. Super fabric and great fit. I feel just like a real girl when I wear his garment close to my skin.,B0000865SC
Fit comfy & it feel great against the body.,B0000865SC
Very useful product - hard to find a good slip nowadays.,B0000865SC
"I totally love these slips. The size is perfect. I have worn these slips for my adult life. Not the same slips but
the SHADOW LINE slips.
The slips makes my out side clothes just slip around and wear so much better. So much smoother. I hope Shadow Line never goes out
of business in my lifetime.",B0000865SC
Sip looks like the picture but I was shocked at how small it was.  I ordered a sixe larger than usual as it was a slip and I wanted it more comfortable than form fitting.  Too msall and not even close.  Seems to be made fairly well though.  Too bad.,B0000865SC
I wear this slip almost every day. Love it!,B0000865SC
The elastic straps make this slip very comfortable.,B0000865SC
Quality product at a great price,B0000865SC
The slip and material was ok. I should have ordered a larger size.,B0000865SC
"I thought I ordered my size per the instructions but it was way too large. The straps aren't the greatest, wish they had been thinner straps and no way to adjust them at all.",B0000865SC
"Just what I wanted, except that it's too large.  My bra size is 34 C, so I ordered a 34.  I need to send it back and exchange it for a 32.",B0000865SC
"Stretch lace straps have just the right tension to keep the straps in place. Nice fit, not too clingy.",B0000865SC
"A little on the large size as I anticipated, but I did not want the item to be too small. The material is very nice and not clingy. It does not ride up (my pet peeve for a slip). The wider straps are very comfortable but might limit the clothing a bit if they show. Overall, I am happy with the purchase.",B0000865SC
"This is a great slip.  Excellent quality.  Straps don't fall down.  It tends to ride up a bit under tighter knit dresses, but it's manageable .  It's longer than I expected.  I'm 5'6"" and it's mid knee so it doesn't work with all of my dresses.",B0000865SC
Love this slip! It fits perfect and after trying in on I'm really feminine sissy boy. Great fit great feel. So soft against my smooth girlish soft skin.,B0000865SC
"The entire slip seems to ride up your body. I find I spend all day tugging it down... :(, I bought it in both black & white.",B0000865SC
Slip was too long and did not fit well at all.,B0000865SC
"Although I purchased the size slip I have worn for years, this slip is too small.",B0000865SC
"This is a nice basic slip and the straps don't show with a sleeveless dress.

I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered a size that normally would be too big for me.  I normally wear a 10 Petite or an 8 or 10 regular and a 34C bra.  The size 38 fit me perfectly.",B0000865SC
"I'm 5'4"", 150lbs. 32E (under bust 31"", over bust 37""), waist 28"", hips 37"" and size 36, 26"" fits well, falls just past my knees.  I probably could have sized down to the 34"", but that may have made the bust too tight.  Plenty of room in the waist and hip though.",B0000865SC
"Very comfortable slip, no slipping straps. I wear size 12 but am broad in the rib cage and a 40 fits perfectly. Fabric is soft and the slip is perfect under sheer summer dresses.",B0000865SC
"This slip exceeds my expectations. I am 5' 11"" tall and weigh 205 pounds. I bought this in size 40, 28 inches long, and it is a perfect fit. The shoulder straps are softly elastic and firm. It does not slip off. The earlier reviews were very helpful in deciding what size to buy. 'Very glad I bought 2 of this. It's a most welcome addition to my underwear ensemble. I will buy more for my mom and sisters. The slip est fantastique!",B0000865SC
"I skeptically bought this because I wasn't sure of my slip size. it fits me perfectly! I am 140lbs, 5'7''.",B0000865SC
"Slips of decent lengths have become hard to find and I am grateful this one is still available. As I previously made the mistake of ordering a slip by my bust size, only to find it too small elsewhere, I ordered one size up but the slip is still a bit tight. This was not true of the white Shadowline ribbon-strap slip that I also ordered. One size up fit just fine in that slip. Otherwise, I am pleased with my purchase and will buy another of these slips.",B0000865SC
It's so comfortable that I wear this slip after hours just as a lounge/ relaxation type of clothing.  I would buy another.,B0000865SC
this slip was not what I expected at all and was of no use to me and it could not be returned.,B0000865SC
"In order to accomodate my waist and hip sizes, I bought a 42-24 length, so it's a little loose up top. the Length is perfect, right at the knee. Very comfortable though.",B0000865SC
It's perfect! Works great under my sundresses! Now I can wear any dress without worrying about lines showing! Great buy!!,B0000865SC
"I didn't know what size to order so I ordered up a size and it is a bit too big but I'm OK with that.  I live in Houston so when the summer heat hits I prefer loose clothing for work.  The straps are a little longer than I expected, but I'm only 5'0"" so that's fine too.  Very pretty, very comfie, very well made.  Me gusta!",B0000865SC
"Very comfortable, washes nicely. Sized perfectly.  I was concerned about the straps not being adjustable but this fits great. Just what I ordered. Will order again from this seller.",B0000865SC
"hard to find longer slip. This one was great fit under a , just the right length dress for wedding. Perfect",B0000865SC
"I bought this slip for my wife, hasn't gone into any details as to why she likes it but she has worn it several times since it arrived.  So she must like it, I know if she didn't I would surely hear that",B0000865SC
"I have had one of these slips in white for over ten years, and it is still like new. The fabric seems the same, and I will enjoy this black one!",B0000865SC
Size and material just as vendor stated.  The fit was perfect for my needs.  Very satisfied with purchase. Thank U.,B0000865SC
"This slip is superior to others I have tried by Shadowline.  Although it fits rather closely, it doesn't squeeze or constrict.  The very comfortable stretch straps are technically not adjustable, but by stretching or contracting they do adjust somewhat.",B0000865SC
This slip is a stiffer material than the last one I purchased. Less giving so it is tighter. I like the stretch straps though. I'm trying to lose  a few more pounds so hopefully it will fit better then. Otherwise I like these type slips.,B0000865SC
I purchased this slip for my Mom who has trouble with the straps falling off her shoulders.  She really likes this slip because she doesn't have this problem with the stretch lace straps.  Time will tell if the elastic lace keeps its shape.,B0000865SC
This slip is very nice!! If fits well and stays in place. It is also very pretty which is an added bonus.,B0000865SC
"Expecting a better fit than this. Not great, but not in love with it. Will keep it, though, because its hard to find old school full slips in the stores.",B0000865SC
"I don't wear slips much during the summer, but this is the best one I have found to wear in cooler weather. It is not a loose fitting slip, so be sure to order the right size. My shoulders and chest area are wider than most women, and I don't like anything close-fitting there, but this size 40 works well.",B0000865SC
"Loved the shape, style and fit. I felt elegant wearing this slip, and it wasn't to thin or see through!",B0000865SC
"I purchased this slip for my Mom.  She loves it because the straps are fully elastic and stay in place and the fabric is not too sheer.  The length is just right for her and she is only about 5 foot (on a good day). :)  She says that she loves the cream color, and she would like me to buy her another.  This is high praise- she can be very, very picky- or should I say discerning?",B0000865SC
"Perfect fit. She just loves the straps with no adjustments. Just what we wanted and ordered. Will be ordering again.
Thanks",B0000865SC
Ordered Shadowline stretch lace strap full slips for my 100 year old aunt who will not dress without  a slip.  The first order was great great and they were Shadowline.  The second order was for more Shadowline but Dixie Belle was substituted.  They look almost the same but the lace used for the straps on the ones labeled Dixie Belle don't lay flat after several washings.  The Dixie Belle also seems to be slightly smaller.  I was not asked if I wanted to switch from Shadowline to Dixie Belle.,B0000865SC
"As other reviewers mentioned, find a fit guide for this slip somewhere else before buying.

To get the right length, meausure a skirt's length -- a 24 inch slip will hit you around the knees, a 28 inch will be mid-calf -- the number is the length from your waist to the end of the slip.

For the bust size, measure the fullest part of your bust, NOT your bra size.

For reference, I'm 5'8"" and wear a 36E bra -- the 38 slip was tight, I should have bought the 40. However, because I measured for length, the 24 inch length was perfect for my slightly-below-the-knee dresses.

Love the stretchy straps and the lack of hardware. Most comfortable slip, ever. Lasts a lifetime, or thereabouts -- the slip I just ordered was a replacement for one that must be 20 years old (and still in good shape -- it just didn't fit my aging body, LOL)!",B0000865SC
purchased this for my mom and it is stunning on person but runs a little small. impressive quality and beautiful details,B0000865SC
"This slip is lovely.  I ordered first the 28 inch length but it was to middle of calves. (I'm 5'6"".) So I returned it and bought the 24 inch length. (Hits about middle of knee.)  The material is really nice; it's soft and doesn't fit too closely to the body.",B0000865SC
"Fits perfectly. I am 5' 2"" and got the Size 34B 24"" long. As others have said, it is hard to find a nice full length slip.",B0000865SC
"My mother wears only skirts, no pants, and wears a slip every day. She will wear only these slips because she loves the elastic straps. She hates to be pulling up slip straps all day and these stay put perfectly.",B0000865SC
"Perfect slip for the GUY who likes the soft and silky . Straps stay in place ,stays soft and silky after many washings , would recommend to both --- men and women. THE BEST SLIP EVER !",B0000865SC
"I liked the shape & construction of the slip.  The elastic in the straps is especially nice as it would keep them softly in place
on the shoulders.
The top was a bit big but the skirt was snug through the hips.  I like this more fitted style to
wear under dresses instead of the full swing style that bunches up.  Have not worn this since I keep telling myself I'll lose that
10 lbs to make it fit in the hip.  HA!",B0000865SC
"Perfect fit, liked the larger width of the shoulder straps and the length of the slip. Will be purchasing more...love it",B0000865SC
"An actual slip!  How fabulous.  It was a good fit, though I imagine this particular slip might not be for the very well endowed.  I am about a B cup and the cups fit well.  The fit around the shoulders is quite good, no slipping straps.  Choose your size and length well because I believe it runs true to size.  It's a great slip.",B0000865SC
"Hate this slip, the top is baggy and does not sit right.  I needed it right away, so I can't return it, but it is the worst-fitting full slip I have ever owned.",B0000865SC
"This is a nice slip for the price, however it was much longer than the description said and I was unable to use it with the dress I purchased it for.",B0000865SC
Its perfect size and material. I loved it. Maybe the V cut can be made a little better but nothing to reject the slip. I ordered 38*24 and should say it fit very well.,B0000865SC
"I wasn't sure how to purchase a slip and read that you should go with your bra size. Well, that did not work for me with this purchase. The slip is too small and enough so that I can not wear it. A sizing guide would be very helpful.",B0000865SC
"This garment is okay but not of the same quality is material and sizing than
 one I had like it and wore for years.",B0000865SC
I'm very impressed with the quality of this slip. the straps stay on my shoulder. the fabric seems to be quality fabric and has a nice texture. I'm going to order more!,B0000865SC
I love wearing it around the house and lounging. It's definitely very feminine and well made. Comfortable and well made.,B0000865SC
"I love this slip.  The texture is delightful.  It holds its shape beautifully.  It fits perfectly.  The straps stay in place.  It's been washed countless times since I bought it 6+ months ago, and it still looks and feels like new.  Highly recommend.",B0000865SC
"I have had this same slip for years and thought I would never find it again.  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying it!  It is the same quality as my first one, purchased many, many years ago.  Usually quality suffers as the years go by, but Shadowline has done a good job retaining quality workmanship and materials.  Wish I could get it in black--I'll have to keep checking Amazon on this one.",B0000865SC
"Purchased as a gift, very satisfied.",B0000865SC
"Most liked-style.
Least-not true to.size. Way.to small and I.ordered it a.size to big!!  I had to.wear it and now don't.know what to do with it. I needed the slip and still do but I am not.paying out more.money at this.point.",B0000865SC
"This was a very nice under clothes slip, unfortunately it was much too small for me! My refund was done very promptly.",B0000865SC
Material heavier than expected.  Low end fabric. Not light weight. Reminds me of a 1959s fabric.  Served its purpose under my one piece sweater dresses.,B0000865SC
"Lovely slip. I'm only 5 ft tall, and I was worred that since the straps don't adjust, it might be a problem.  Nope!",B0000865SC
"The material is thin.  The armholes dig into my flesh.  The ""projection"" is comic.",B0000867L1
"These hose looked great.  However, they got a giant snag within one hour of wearing them.  Not worth the price.",B0000894LW
"I opened mine this morning and within hours, there were several tiny but visible holes - on the upper thigh, not even any place where it could have touched anything.",B0000894LW
"I received these pantyhose today and was disappointed.  I was quickly shopping online for a wedding next week, and was mislead because these pantyhose came up under toeless.  After looking over many different brands I decided on these, not realizing they were not toeless until I received them.  It was my fault for not reading the product description better, but I think they should not show up under the toeless search.  I will still keep and use them, as they do seem like a great material.",B0000894LW
I bought these because my favorite department-store brand hose was discontinued. The material here feels too opaque for the high price. The cheaper discontinued Bloomingdales-brand hose had a finer thread fabric. I won't buy these again.,B0000894LW
"No one can tell you have these on, but you--gives a sleek line, perfects legs and feel great--tall sizes are for long legs, not just bigger all over.  I LOVE THIS PROdUCT",B0000894LW
"Like all of Donna Karan hosiery the ""nudes"" are fabulous.  They feel great and really do look like your legs are bare!!  From the time I found Donna Karan hosiery I haven't been able to wear any other brand.",B0000894LW
"Like all of donna karen's hose, this one excels.  The bonus...a beautiful sleek line under any outfit.",B0000894LW
"I love her hosery.  If you're willing to pay the price, you'll love your legs!",B0000894LW
They fit wonderful!  I highly recommend their product.,B0000894LW
Wonderful hose for summer wear.,B0000894LW
"Because of the price, i felt this was good quality product.
Very disappointed as this ripped just as tried it on for the VERY FIRST TIME. phew...
could not wear it for the event that i had very much waited for.
I Do not recommend!!!!!",B0000894LW
"DK's The Nudes are the best pantyhose ever. They're like a second skin, making your legs look nicer. Only one issue: they don't last long.",B0000894LW
"This listing shows up when searching for a variety of different DK hosiery styles. When clicking through previous purchase orders for at least 4 different styles they all come back here with no clear verification of what you're actually ordering.

Several other reviews reference a thick front seam that does not lay smoothly under clothing and I have had one pair of the Signature Sheer Control Top with this problem, though other previous pairs were delightful.

The new Nudes Control Top are like tissue - I had multiple runs, all originating where the leg meets the control top, within 2 hours of putting them on. Thank heavens I was wearing a color so close to my skin tone it was hard to tell, but a total waste of money.",B0000894LW
"My favorite pantyhose. Great color, shear but not too shear, fits well and very good price on Amazon....usually $20 at Nordstroms.",B0000894LW
Makes my legs look and feel great.  Non-reinforced toes look almost toeless and lets my toe polish show in sandals.  I wear hose to work each day and am thrilled to find these!,B0000894LW
Put hole in them before I got them on.  Go too the local store and just buy the cheap ones.  Disappointed :(,B0000894LW
"Product sticky-labeled as tone A03, but the hose match the darker A05 tone when compared to the color code on the actual box. These are way too dark for me to wear as nude hose. I'm not going to return them, but I can't wear them in the manner intended either.",B0000894LW
very good items. The seller is great.,B0000894LW
"I have a pair I having been wearing for a few years, albeit only accasionally. I suspect the folks with run problems aren't used to wearing nylons daily, and don't have the careful habits born of frequent use. I frankly can't believe how long mine have lasted. However, the reviewer that mentioned the thick seam is correct. It seems unnecessary, and is visible under lightweight fabrics. I normally wear Hanes Silk Reflections everyday, but these hold up well and have a far nicer feel to the fabric.",B0000894LW
"The absolute best nude hose for the price out there. If you want nicer ones, you'll pay for it.  These are attractive, warm, and comfortable.  I think they run a little large, but I find that with most hose, so many it's just me.",B0000894LW
"I like the sheer factor, but I only got 1 or 2 wears from them and they both ran.",B0000894LW
I was really looking for stockings that wouldn't run and I had a lot of hope for these but they ran the third time I wore them.,B0000894LW
"I ordered these particular pantyhose, because I wanted to wear them with a form-fitting cocktail dress and I didn't want it to be obvious that I'm wearing pantyhose. And that was certainly true on the legs.  However, there is a very thick seam going from the crotch to the waste and it was very visible and there was nothing I could do to hide it. I ended up not wearing these pantyhose as result and will return the extra pair I ordered.  So, if you are going to wear them under a thick business suit skirt, then go for it. But if you want to wear them under a dress made out of a thin fabric, then these are not for you.",B0000894LW
"I have bought two pair of these hose from the same seller. There was a very musty, basementty smell that I assumed would go away upon washing. Not so. I washed them four times, twice in the washing machine, but still could smell the unpleasant odor when I was wearing them. Reported to the seller who said they ""would look into it.""

Finally had to throw them away - waste of almost $40.00.",B0000894LW
I looked at the chart and read the reviews and ordered accordingly yet still found the my color choice to be way off the mark. The tone A01 was a buff tone and looked more anemic than I normally look without hose! Sent them back and regret having made such a purchase online. This is one item I will make a trip to the mall for in the future.,B0000894LW
"I bought those for my wife. She is happy with quality and nice sheer look of it plus nude control top. However I cut one stars as there are very delicate and you have to be very careful especially when you are putting  them on.
Overall they are very nice and you legs will look as bare legs but thy expensive, especially if you can run the out in one-two nights. They are perfect for special occasion or evenings when you want your legs look almost bare with gentle touch of nylon.
They are running true to size.",B0000894LW
"I was so excited when I got these because they were gorgeous for super fair skin, and they made my legs look great. I wore them for 4 hours and everything was fine. Until I took them off and noticed the toe was already ripped on both sides. I hoped it would be okay if I was really careful, but the next time I wore them the tear kept getting larger and more noticeable. I then tried adding clear nail polish, but at that point, they had too many runs. For the amount I spent, i expected them to last longer.",B0000894LW
By far the perfect balance between natural looking and the look of hose just adding the right amount of sheen. So comfortable,B0000894LW
"The color is perfect
Doesn't make my legs look orange or dark tan",B0000894LW
These are invisible when you wear them...perfect pantyhose.,B0000894LW
Looked beautiful but had huge runs after 2 wears and had to throw away. Disappointing given the cost!,B0000894LW
"Looked great on  and was perfect to wear with a miniskirt, however they ran after only wearing them for barely an hour.  Not worth the money.",B0000894LW
The seam is very thick running up the front of hosiery - so much so it shows under clingy fabric.  Does not give a smooth shape.,B0000894LW
"The only pantyhose I wear  looks like bare legs, only better!",B0000894LW
Too small and I ordered the wrong color.,B00008AASS
i got this for my girlfriend she loves them,B00008AASS
"These are perfect, except they fit small in the waist. Very tight. They make your legs look wonderful, and it really looks like your not wearing hose. I will buy again but in a medium. I'm 5ft 6in and weigh 115lbs, and according to the size charge, the small should fit, and it did but just way to tight in the waist.",B00008AASS
"I've purchased this exact product from a department store with no problems, so I expected an exact fit when I bought these online.  However, they are much bigger/longer/looser than the store bought ones.  I'll stick to getting them at the store.  Not sure why the difference.",B00008AASS
"Very firm control top made getting the pantyhose on a bit difficult, but the fit was just right once accomplished.",B00008AASS
This is my favorite hosiery...control is excellent. Only wish some of the colors that were previously offered would return.,B00008AASS
These pantyhose are aways a sure thing. You can barely tell you're wearing them and they tuck and smooth everything nicely. Been wearing them for years.,B00008AASS
"I am not a fan of the hose-free look for women like me over 50.  These hose look like you aren't really wearing hose, just covering up imperfections.  As I looked around at the older women NOT wearing hose, I thought this look was better.  I did not have a problem with runs.  I'm so glad nude hose are acceptable again! I made the mistake of ordering A01 and they were way too light.  A03 is perfect.",B00008AASS
"I have worn these hose for many years, and they are the perfect color and fit very well. That being said, they do run easily...",B00008AASS
I've been wearing this bra for years and will continue to wear it.  I only wish it was available in more colors!,B00008IOI3
Very comfortable fit. Love how it makes me look in my clothes. Size is right on.,B00008IOI3
"Another Great Fantasie Bra! I've been wearing the 4510 and 4520 for about 20 years. They're the only Fantasie bras I'd ever worn. After breast reduction surgery I went from a 32F to a 32D. I thought that I'd try a different Fantasie bra and this one really delivers. Like the others, it has great support. It's true to size. I like how the straps angle in toward my neck a little which will allow me to wear tank tops in the summer without having my bra straps show. Some reviewers complained that the bra is a little revealing because the cup material isn't thick enough. So far I haven't noticed it. But, this is winter and I'm wearing lots of layers over the bra which is black. I'll probably know more about that in the summertime when I wear the tan bra with thinner tops. But if it's a problem I'll just buy the Nippies nipple covers from Amazon that some reviewers have bought. It sounds like the perfect solution. I'm really glad that I took the chance and ordered this bra!",B00008IOI3
This has been my go-to bra for years. Great under t-shirts.,B00008IOI3
I thought I was getting a bra with some padding so I could wear it under t-shirts.  This one doesn't have any padding.,B00008IOI3
Love this very effective bra! It's not very sexy but having my 32G breasts well contained during a work day is very comforting and allows me to be more comfortable in all situations. Love this bra.,B00008IOI3
"If you get the correct size, this is perfect in every way.  Gives a modern rounded shape with excellent support.  Wires between cups sit flat on sternum.  Straps are comfortable with virtually no jiggle when walking.  Absolutely smooth under clothing.  You will not be wearing this with anything low cut, as you can see in the photo--no dcolletage--but if you want an comfortable, secure, everyday bra with modest necklines, &/or a smooth T-shirt brassiere, this is the one for you.",B00008IOI3
I ordered the next cup size and it fits quite well,B00008IOI3
"This is the best T-shirt bra ever.  Band fits perfect , support of band not cutting into shoulders like so many brand. .Still have my others from over a year, but never want this style to change so ordered my 3rd to have as spare.. 38F  perfect fit. Don't even try to find a better price, they almost never go on sale...",B00008IOI3
"Wish I would have returned this bra right away.  I liked it at first but realized after one wear that it is now the most uncomfortable bra I own (even though most bras I own are totally the wrong size!), due to a  moronic design flaw in the straps-- I am an average female height of 5'5"" & the place where the each strap comes together/is reinforced lands right on top of my shoulders.  By the end of the day, I have a painful mark on the top of each shoulder where this stitching is.  It doesn't seem to help to loosen the straps, and I don't want to loosen all the way anyway because then the ladies aren't held up.  Very disappointed.",B00008IOI3
"I think this is probably fine for some people, it's well-made, but it's not the right fit or style for me.",B00008IOI3
"I love Fantasie's balcony bra, and thought I'd try this. I went up a size in band, and maybe should have gone down a cup size. The band is still snug, and while I fill the cups, they are a bit loose. They have a natural look, so if you're a big busted gal and want to be lifted, this isn't for you. Also, while there is full coverage, (not sheer fabric), you can still show through, as the fabric isn't thick, if you know what I mean. Straps were a bit tight, and I found myself wanting to change bras when I got home. But I like the smoothing look, and will definitely use this bra.",B00008IOI3
"It fits great and feels great, but I had to add padding to the cups to prevent the buttons from showing.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.  With the padding, looks great with a tshirt or think tops.",B00008IOI3
Not as comfortable as Wacoal bras. Returned.,B00008IOI3
"I bought this bra abroad and I'm thrilled to be able to find it again. It's comfortable, has good lift,  the two hooks is nice,  at my size, padding is not needed and 2 years later I finally snapped the underwire.... Wishing for more colors.",B00008IOI3
"This is a good, comfortable, reliable bra.",B00008IOI3
"I've worn this bra (and Fantasie's other smooth styles) for decades. If you are large chested, there's no better bra. Worth every penny. Great support and fit and no seams show through! LOVE!",B00008IOI3
Fit is exceptional!  This is the best bra for larger breasted women!,B00008IOI3
Love this style.  Fits well.  No show-through on shirts.  Adjustable straps.  Just wish they were cheaper.,B00008IOI3
"I was fitted for this bra at a high end department store in NYC and the pricing is better on Amazon. FYI... I was told that Bra's should have 2 hooks not 4, which makes this very comfortable to wear.",B00008IOI3
"I've worn Fantasie bras in the past, so I ordered my current size.  The bra is well made from quality material - unfortunately, the cups run large and I was unable to fill them.  I returned and will try ordering down a size.",B00008IOI3
This bra was 3 sizes too big. When the price is too good to be true...there's a reason,B00008IOI3
I liked this bra. It covers well and blends with my skin color.  Meaning it's not at all see through and my breasts don't peek out at the top. So it's an excellent choice for teeshirts or see through tops.  The seam on the side kind of digs in a bit and I'm thinking/hoping that will improve after wearing a few times because otherwise it's a great bra.,B00008IOI3
"Have worn and enjoyed the ""uplift"" of these bras for years, ....they last incredibly....hand wash and air dry...only replacing every 3 to 4 years!  Need only two of each nude and black (what a relief!) for everyday use!  Thank you Fantasie!  Key is get properly fit...I thought I was a 36C, then discovered I was a 34DD....fit it important!  Found fit in fancy lingerie shop in ATL, then ordered direct ever since with some $$ savings!",B00008IOI3
This is my go to bra I love it . I will buy it in every color . Working in a professional environment you want to make sure your besties are supported and fully cover .,B00008IOI3
"This bra is well made, but that is it. It flattens the breast,doesn't give any shape,make breasts look wide and push it to the arm pits.",B00008IOI3
Surprisingly cheap and flimsy construction.  Probably explains the low price point given the brand.,B00008IOI3
This bra is not really what I expected. It doesn't fit as well as a previous Fantasies bra I purchased.,B00008IOI3
Great buy. Great fit.  Very comfortable for full figures,B00008IOI3
"This product did not come as shown in the picture.  Even with a second one, it is definitely not like the one I bought in the store.  Very disappointed.",B00008IOI3
"its hard to find my size, this one worked great~! fits me well and i am not hanging out",B00008IOI3
This is my new favorite bra.  It feels like a second skin and it is so smooth under clothes.  The price was excellent too.,B00008IOI3
"Very comfortable, well made, and flattering!",B00008IOI3
I had an old one an replaced it with this new one. Thanks.,B00008IOI3
I ordered these before. The ones I had were starting to poke me so I had to buy new ones. They are really comfortable for me.,B00008IOI3
It is awesome and exactly what I wanted!,B00008IOI3
"I really liked the fit of this bra, but it went up too high on my neckline. I don't wear anything low cut and it was poking out of everything. It would be great for under sweatshirts or tshirt, but not what I was looking for.",B00008IOI3
I LOVE this bra! I have been wearing nothing but for about 5 years. BEST SUPPORT!! I wish the 4500 came in more colors ,B00008IOI3
i do not know if i have lost weight or the cups are big but i like it just the same,B00008IOI3
"Fit exactly like the ones I bought at an upscale Atlanta ""specialty"" boutique. Its the same size & brand for 1/2 the price- and I didn't have to fight Atl traffic to get it! Highly recommend! I'd give 6 or 7 stars if I could!",B00008IOI3
"The cup cut was much smaller- almost as though they were ""irregular"" or ""seconds"" (basically mistakes). The quality seemed exactly th same as what I have purchased in a brick and mortar store which is why I think these may be ""seconds"" or the manufacturer has gone for a loop. Disappointing.",B00008IOI3
"I'm a size 38H so I ordered the 38FF size.  It fits just fine.  It is quite snug and smooth, which I find to be good things in a bra.  However, it does come up pretty high so I have to be careful about the v-neck shirts I wear but mostly about tank tops.  The cups are not molded which is less bulk but also less support.  Don't get me wrong, it is quite supportive but not quite in the realm of LeMystere's Tisha or anything.",B00008IOI3
"The quality of the bra and fit are fine, but too often it peeks out when wearing tops that are cut in a v-neck or even some scoop-necks.  My clothing choices aren't particularly racy so it's bothersome that even a normal top would show the bra.  Mostly, I only wear the bra if I'm certain it won't show.",B00008IOI3
"This a very comfortable bra that requires no tugging or pulling to keep ""the girls"" in place.  It does not dig into the shoulders either.  I would highly recommend this bra.",B00008IOI3
"As a full figured woman, I appreciate not having additional padding in my bra.  The smooth lines are invisible under the thinnest T-shirt.",B00008IOI3
"I do like these bras, however, I probably ordered the incorrect size.  I should have known my exact size before ordering! I should have sent them back for a smaller size.",B00008IOI3
"I had another one in the same size that fits great, but this one is too tight around.",B00008IOI3
"This is my favorite bra. I have them in black and white and I use them until they fall apart. They are tough and take some abuse. Wonderful t-shirt bra. They fit well and are comfortable all day.  Not so great if your straps are going to show, the straps have that quilted underwear look.",B00008IOI3
"I never considered buying a bra through the mail because I felt to get a true fit, you should try on,but this bra is perfect fit, great price and lovely!  I'm 100% happy with my purchase thru the mail and will buy more bras this way.  Highly recommend !  Annemarie C.",B00008IOI3
"I thought they must somehow hope to hit and miss by getting you to keep coming back to one supplier only if you happen to luck out and find something that fits well, but even THAT doesn't work with fantasie! I got an old used bra/from my daughter even had one under wire missing and I love it. Never had anything fit quite so well. It is a fantasie 32DDD, but I can't seem to find that they use ridiculous cross reference numbers within their own line and I have yet to get a 32E 34E 32DD or 34DD that fits. Thank goodness for Amazon/prime letting me Keep sending back. Did I mention I DO HAVE one hand me down? Yeah, well, its ALL I have",B00008IOI3
"I wear a 36 G and have tried all kinds of different bras and brands. The only down side is I cannot wear it with something thin in the cold.  It seems to be the sister bra to their t-shirt bra that I have several of.  I have learned by trial and error to just stick with Fantasie.  They last forever and provide more support all day long than any other brand that I have tried.  I know that Fantasie bras are a little pricey but, they are well worth it.",B00008IOI3
"I love this bra!  I'm an older woman, 5'2"" and weigh 160 lbs with a 32"" band width making it difficult to find a comfortable bra.  This bra holds my girls perfectly, no over top bulging.  The cups are not padded to prevent nipple see through, so I bought Nippies Skin Reusable Matte Silicone Nipple Cover Pasties NON-ADHESIVE and issue solved!  It's nice to go through the day comfortable and confident I have the support I need with no see through.

Before purchasing this bra I wore the Fantasie Smoothing Underwire T-Shirt Bra, which fit okay.  My complaint (for my body build) is the straps would slide off my shoulder and the cups, although well padded for no see through, tended to push my girls over the top of the cup.",B00008IOI3
This is the perfect bra for people with hard to find bra sizes. The bras fit as expected and are very comfortable. The elastic also withstands the test of time.,B00008IOI3
Great bra for full figures.  Comfortable and less than $50.,B00008IOI3
Bought this bra for my wife and she seemed to enjoy it very much!  I can't decide if it was a good thing or a bad thing that there were no surprises.  I'm guessing some sweet action death lasers would have been cool  but also might have been a hassle for day to day wear and use.....,B00008IOI3
Finally. One that fits and is comfortable as well. Would recommend.,B00008IOI3
I am just having the hardest time finding the right size in this brand. I went from 32gg to 32g and now 32ff. Still too big in the cup. Maybe I'll fit a 32f if I decide to give this another shot.,B00008IOI3
This is the best fitting bra I have ever owned.  The gore is flat in the cleavage like it is supposed to lie. The cups are nice and smooth with no puckering and no extra padding.  The band is true to size and doesn't dig into me.  The straps are comfortable without extra padding and don't slip.  The bra gives a nice natural appearance under clothes and is virtually seamless under a thin t-shirt.  I will be buying more of these.,B00008IOI3
"This fits well, but the fabric is so thin, it hardly provides any support, coverage, or shape. Also, there are only 2 rows of hooks on the back and for a size 36F, I prefer 3.",B00008IOI3
"I ordered the same size that I currently owned, and the product was bigger than the one I already have. Returned because it's too big.",B00008IOI3
"Cut into armpit area, squashed ""the girls"" a bit.",B00008IOI3
Most comfortable bra I have every owned.,B00008IOI3
"Fits perfectly, is super comfy, and invisible under t-shirts as long as you're not a little chilly. Did have to buy another after four months because my monster bosoms showed this poor darling no mercy. Elastic wore out faster than expected, but no biggie.",B00008IOI3
"I have been wearing the Fantasie Full Cup Underwire Bra for many years now and they never disappoint.  They are comfortable, look nice and they last a long time.",B00008IOI3
"I have been buying this product for many years.  It is a wonderful bra, fits well and I am totally satisfied.",B00008IOI3
These bras fit perfectly and give you excellent coverage.  The side wire doesn't dig into the skin which is a plus.  I work long days and this bra holds up and doesn't become uncomfortable. They are well made and hold up to repeated washings.,B00008IOI3
"It's not lined so you definitely might have 2 peaks showing through your shirt.  The cup wasn't the right fit for me.  I've been experimenting with finding the appropriate bra sizes and decided to try a 30F in this bra because a 30 E wasn't available.  My true bra size is a 28E and my sister sizes are a 30DD and a 26F.  I thought if I went in the middle and got a 30E it would fit but I was wrong.  Definitely get your true size in this bra if they have it,  If they don't, then I wouldn't recommend getting a sister size or guessing which size would fit.",B00008IOI3
The band has only 2 hooks. which makes the band cut into my back.  Large cup size bras need more hooks.,B00008IOI3
"I have worn this bra for years. Previously have purchased from Nordstrom and Lord and  Taylor.
The price was great a $36 vs. $50 but the bra I received with this purchase is not the same in terms of the quality of the fabric. The fabric is very thin. I would not buy on line again.",B00008IOI3
"I used the universal sizing to supposedly get the same size as my last bra, but the cups were too small on the new one. Boo.",B00008IOI3
"Love, love this bra. I have rather large breast (38G) and I often spend $70 to $80 or more on my bras because I need excellent support and fit.  This takes care of both.  Also, the price is amazing.  I wish is came in more colors than the basic nude; which is every big chested girls only bra color selection, but overall I love this product and would buy more.",B00008IOI3
"For whatever reason, i cannot get this bra to lay smooth - gapping at the top and the size down is too small....  would have made a great seamless addition but i have to return it",B00008IOI3
"Material is not soft, rough, and not very comfortable. Disappointed by this fantasie product. Unfortunately, I will not buy again.",B00008IOI3
"so I bought this one, which was much less expensive than the one I bought at Nordstrom.  The cups in this one are too big, but other than that it's fine.",B00008IOI3
Excited to have a bra that finally fits!!  It's just a bra but when you can't find one in town it's exciting to have one!,B00008IOI3
"The title says most of it, as did another reviewer.  The bra itself is comfortable, but the design pushes the breast flesh away from the sternum and down slightly, which is not my preferred style.  I returned it because I disliked the shape.  Many issues would be solved if the photos were more accurate and detailed.",B00008IOI3
"This bra is super comfortable but, to me, it does not look attractive under a shirt. It made it look like the girls were pushed out to the sides of my body, with a big gap in the middle. Now I only wear it on the days I just need something comfortable.",B00008IOI3
"This bra didn't fit me correctly compared to other Fantasie bras. The center piece fell forward, which is unsightly. I ended up returning this item and purchases items from a different brand. Good bras in these sizes are hard to find and require a great deal of trial and error (mostly error).",B00008IOI3
I love the product!!! But the size which is my size doesn't have a good feel or fit. Which is why it gets a four.,B00008IOI3
"This is my new favorite bra!

I am very large (34I) and this bra not only comes in a large enough size (hard enough to accomplish that) - but is very comfortable and keeps my girls lifted and separated.  The cups are smooth, which means you can wear under anything without fear of it showing through your shirt.

I love this bra so much that when I was nursing, I took it to my seamstress and had her convert it to a nursing bra, so I could continue to wear it,throughout that time.

Good quality, too. With proper washing (cold water, hand wash cycle, gentle soap) - it will easily last me a year + before I have to replace it.  I can't say enough good things about this bra - but I can tell you that I have been buying 3 of them (one in each color), every year for the past 5 years.  That's how much I love it!",B00008IOI3
"they make your boobs look oddly shaped.
I don't recommend this horrible bra.
don't waste your money on this one.",B00008IOI3
"I ABSOLUTELY love this bra. I went to a bra guru and she measured me, fitted me, and I tried on 3,000 bras. I bought two of these from her at $120 a pop because they fit perfectly, provided great support and coverage (front, sides, and back), and it didn't look like it was for an 80 year old lady. It's not sexy, but I didn't want lace, half cups, or anything frilly for a day to day bra. This bra rocks. So when I found it on amazon for 1/4 the price I instantly bought two more. I had already bought 4 others from Bare Necessities, but they were still $80. Gotta love amazon for finding the lowest price for the brand you love and the size that fits!!",B00008IOI3
This bra actually fit and the cups were not too small.  The support is also fantastic.  I judge bras pretty harshly (either the cups are too small and my tshirts don't lie smoothly or there is no support and I wind up bouncing all over the place).  This bra is wonderful and I will order it again.,B00008IOI3
"I've been having trouble finding a bra that fits me properly.  I did order two different sizes in one order, so that I would be able to know which one fit better.  Glad I did.  NIce bra at a decent price.",B00008IOI3
"I have been fitted by a professional and this is the bra recommended for me.  They are expensive, but they are a lot more reasonable at this site.  The fit and support is the best I have found in my size.",B00008IOI3
This has to be my new favorite bra! It is so comfortable. Great support and I am a 38G! You will not be able to wear this with a low cut shirt but it will look great under tshirts and sweaters.,B00008IOI3
"Wasn't sure what to expect, but it fits perfect.  Have purchased others of this style in the store and preferred to purchase online to avoid hassle of pushy sales people in a store.  Fits as I thought and definitely cheaper online.",B00008IOI3
"Cup is odd and puckers near the under arms.  I've never had that in a bra before. Material is cheap and feels ""scratchy.  This bra went back.",B00008IOI3
"I wish they had more colors!!!!!!. I am a 36DD and this bra actually makes me look smaller with better posture. I have been wearing Victoria secret bras for many years, but never get the support I need. The full size is very comfortable and the material is thin, which is what I wanted. I don't want to look larger.",B00008IOI3
"I have the t-shirt bra in n this same brand and love it, but this one although supportive, just not attractive. I'm a 30G and I know I can't expect to wear those lacy cute  bras the smaller girls get to wear, but I would like somewhat attractive. I'm not  ready to look like a granny just yet.",B00008IOI3
i received the bra for my wife  in 3 days but the bra just did n ot work for her I called for a return. I will order from them again,B00008IOI3
I'm well endowed and have never had much luck with Victoria Secret bras.  They never fit correctly and the teens they have working there don't really know how to fit women correctly.  This bra is awesome!  I do recommend you go to a good specialty bra shop to get measured/fitted before purchasing online however.,B00008IOI3
My order arrived right on time and was in great condition. I really like this bra with T-shirts. I have one in each of the colors.,B00008IOI3
"I have shopped at many bra shops in the US and Europe. If you are a 38G and short-waisted this bra is the one for you. I have paid over a hundred dollars in Houston for this bra, so to find it between forty and fifty dollars on Amazon is great.  The bras are from England and the quality is excellent. The material the bra is made from never breaks down, it is the wire poking thru that signals that the bra is dead. When this happens I get out my sewing machine, fix the area and use it for another year or so. Even at one hundred dollars Fantasie bras are worth the price!",B00008IOI3
"I love this brand of bras. The product was exactly what i expected. Of course when you are this size, i suggest you get professionally fitted first.",B00008IOI3
"I purchased this bra based on the size I wear in another brand.  Unfortunately the bra was to big in the cup.  I returned it for the next size smaller.  The cup fit is still not perfect.  It tends to be a little bunched at the top.  The overall construction is very good.  I think most people would probably find the fit right, I tend to have trouble finding bras that fit properly.",B00008IOI3
"I had high hopes that this would be the one.  You ladies with DD plus figures know what I'm talking about.  A bra that supports, shapes and still looks somewhat attractive while providing all day comfort.  Well, this one missed the mark for me.  The straps do dig a bit (although, not as bad as most) and doesn't provide enough lift and/or adjustment. It does not give the well rounded shape I was looking for either.  It's comfortable enough to wear around the house while I'm going through my 'to-do' list, but would not choose this one for an evening out.",B00008IOI3
"Excellent fitting bra for those of us in Ds. I have purchased Fantasie bras for more in stores and was pleased to find it available here.  However, for unknown reasons all of it, except the cups and the front of the straps, turned a very pale shade of yellow the first time it was washed. No bleach and regular detergent was used - go figure.",B00008IOI3
"I've worn this bra for several months and while it's a decent fit the fabric is thin so don't expect to be protected from ""cold environments"" if you know what I mean.",B00008IOI3
This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup. It's a nice bra if you're looking for that style but I'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup!,B00008IOI3
I am a large busted woman with a narrow frame. I have always been stuck in a 36 band size just because the normal bras at department stores started in a 36 when moving into the triple D and beyond size.  It was a trip to England and a bra fitting that I discovered I was wearing the wrong band and cup size. I found Fantasie and I have been a fan ever since. There is no spillage out of the cups and the band stays put.,B00008IOI3
"Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return this product.  However, had I ordered the right size, I still would have returned it.  The description states ""smooth cup"" which I took to mean that it would be discreet, even in cold weather.  This was not the case, the cup has thin material and would not hide anything.  Although it is a pretty bra, it's not good to wear under form fitting clothes.  :(",B00008IOI3
"I usually buy Body by Victoria(Victoria Secret) bras, but because I have DD's, the straps tend to loosen throughout the day causing sagging.  But they are lined, which I like.

When I first go this bra in the mail, I was slightly disapointed that it was not lined(it sort of looked lined in the photo), but I tried it on anyways....and LOVED it!  The straps stay right where you put them so you don't sag later in the day and they really hold up larger breasts!  It is very comfortable, but supportive at the same time!  I will continue to buy this bra, but I bet I won't need to purchase them as often as I was when I was wearing VS bras...I think they are more meant for looks and for smaller breasted woman(VS).  I highly recommend this product!!",B00008IOI3
"I LOVE this bra.  Offers great support.  It is not the first I have gotten like it, and the ones I previously purchased have lasted WELL over a year (take note that I do not put my bras in the dryer).  I would recommend this bra to anyone looking for good support and comfort in a bra.",B00008IOI3
I had ordered this same bra from a Lingerie Store about a year ago and this one is not the same quality. The material is thinner and I don't get as much support. But it says it's made by the same manufacturer.,B00008IOI3
"NOT a moulded bra! The cups are not moulded but thin, flimsy, unlined. This bra is falsely advertised. Returned for a refund.",B00008IOI3
The most comfortable bra ever.  Unfortunately Fantasie have stopped making them.,B00008IOI3
"Full coverage, as I like it.  Great support, no bouncing when walking.  Would like wider back with 3 hooks.  Otherwise a perfect bra.",B00008IOI3
"Unlined cups, good quality and fit, but not what I was expecting based on the ""moulded"" cup product description.  Will be returning and looking for another style by Fantasie that has a double lining or light padding in the cups instead.",B00008IOI3
"I have been buying this bra for the last 20 yrs. If you are small of back (32) but large of breast,(D) and want not to bounce when you walk, and still wear a T shirt without seeing any seams, this is the bra for you. Not sexy...granted but it does what it says on the tin. No scratchy lace either.",B00008IOI3
Wasn't impressed by the material I felt it was kind of scratchy. The cups where much to big even in my normal size. I reccomend going down in cup if you purchase this bra. Had to return.,B00008IOI3
fits wonderfully and gives great support.,B00008IOI3
Sizing was way off.  Window to return expired so now I'm stuck with a bad product.,B00008IOI3
Iam a Or nurse and Iam on my feet all day. When I wear these nylonsmy legs arnt tired at the end of the day.,B00008MORX
"My wife bought this for and I'm glad u guys have it, so we don't have to go to store just to buy this... She hope there more suntan pantyhose option...",B00008MORX
I Love these nylons.  They really do energize your legs while wearing them and they're durable to wear several times.,B00008MORX
Love these pantyhose and they have stopped selling them at my Walmart. I was so glad to find them online.,B00008MORX
I purchased thinking that I was getting 9 pairs due to the product title.  Please note that you will only get 2 pair.,B00008MORX
Sheer resistant.  They last long,B00008MORX
"FIT VERY WELL BUT I GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE THEY HAD A MUSTY SMELL AND EVEN AFTER BEING WASHED, THE SMELL DID NOT COMPLETELY GO AWAY.",B00008MORX
Love these. They are a little hard to find around the Orlando area so this is s great place to purchase them.,B00008MORX
"Very tight in the waist.  But then again, I'm a little thick in the waist...",B00008MORX
it is difficult to find this color in my area.  Nice fit,B00008MORX
"Be aware that 'Queen' (Q) runs small.
The material feels and looks great!.. But it doesn't help when they can't fit.",B00008MORX
"I have been using this product for many years. Obviously, I like the look and feel of the leggs because I keep buying them. I am a petite woman and the leggs fit perfectly without sagging.",B00008MORX
Most satisfactory! Will probably order again i the future!,B00008MORX
Came as advertised. No earlier. No later.,B00008MORX
"I have been wearing these style of nylons for many years and recently discovered the outlet store that I used to purchase them from had closed. I was unable to locate them in the regular stores until I discovered them on Amazon. Very happy with my purchase. They arrived on the date as promised and the quality is good.
thanks
J",B00008MORX
"Love these light weight support nylons.  I have worn these for years and years.  I stand at work all day and even though they are sheer, they have a lot of support.  Love! Love! Love!  The suntan color is such a nice neural shade.",B00008MORX
"These nylons seem to have shorter legs, as they kept sliding down, therefore they were very uncomfortable.  I have a 31"" leg length.",B00008MORX
my girlfriend likes them just fine,B00008MORX
I've bought these for years. They look great. Waist band is a little small.,B00008MORX
Got a run before I even put it on...,B00008MORX
"I'm 5'11"" with a medium frame, and the Queen size didn't fit that well. Usually, in other brands I get the equivalent of this size, but these were too small.",B00008MORX
Loved these pantyhose! They were perfect! They fit well from waist to toes! I love the high level of spandex in them!,B00008MORX
"Just opened my box and the pantyhose are the same good material. All it changed was the box, but I like these pantyhose.",B00008MORX
"These are really great. Good feel,longevity, and price.",B00008MORX
"thicker than the cheaper ones you get from store, but still managed to put a hole in them",B00008MORX
I ordered the wrong nylons I want all sheer.,B00008MORX
"These hose looked okay when I was wearing them, but we're kind of small.  I also had a run in the foot after wearing them once.",B00008MORX
"I have worn L'eggs Shear Energy almost since they came on the market........more years ago than I will tell.  They are wonderful and make your legs feel so good, and look good too, whatever size you may be.",B00008MORX
"Yes, there are still some women who wear pantyhose and these are the best and  NO CONTROL TOP......and the suntan color is great.  I have worn for years but recently have had trouble finding  them.",B00008MORX
"they arrived on time and in good condition,the right size, the right color and shade.",B00008MORX
"Great hose, love the color and how they fit with NO pantyline.  Will definitely be ordering these again.  Soft too and not too tight.  Would definitely recommend them for Fall and Winter especially since most people don't wear hose in the Summer.  I will though because the Suntan color enhances a tan.  I stay tan all year round.  LEGGS has other colors too. I wear the Suntan color mainly, sometimes black.",B00008MORX
These pantyhose are so hard to find in stores.  So glad I can buy them on Amazon.  Good fit and very comfortable.,B00008MORX
They are the best out there. They feel incredible I wear them all the time,B00008MORX
"good fit, good feel. enjoy wearing this product everyday. would like them in  a few different colors however",B00008MORX
Nice fit and shade.  Easy to put on and economical,B00008MORX
"I have been wearing these pantyhose for MANY years, but I've not been able to find them. They fit great and they make me look smooth and also make me feel thinner. They kind of compress everything from my ankles to my waist. I have been looking for these at three different stores in my area and couldn't find them. I tried other brands of pantyhose, at other stores, but none are as comfortable as L'eggs Sheer Energy. I'm soooo glad I found them at Amazon. Thanks, Amazon!",B00008MORX
"I had no problems with this. Not great quality but good quality stockings. Of course, you could pay more for better quality.",B00008MORX
Great feel and look to these hose. I like the way they make my legged look natural with a touch of color.,B00008MORX
The only thing missing is the egg.  The fit is excellent and smooth.  I can wear a pair for weeks and not get a run or snag.,B00008MORX
I wore these hose many many moons ago.  I have gained some weight but in need of nice hosiery. I was happy to see that Leggs Sheer Energy has not changed at all. They feel like silk on your legs and look very nice and pretty on.  My husband loves them as well.  That is a big bonus!,B00008MORX
"I always order this brand and style.  I prefer thie color, too! I'll order again next time!  The price was fair, too.",B00008MORX

"After vein surgery and being in support hose, these are the perfect support for my legs and veins for continued maintenance.  I am a repeat customer and will be back for more!",B00008MORX
"When I opened the box this morning and took the top pair of hose out, it was inside out and had a BIG hole in them.  Not happy about that!  The second pair was fine.  These are hard to find in any stores.",B00008MORX
"Good support, lasts a few wears, fits as expected, perfect for work.  Difficult to find these in the stores anymore.",B00008MORX
"they do so because the line curls around the legg no matter how hard I try to put them on straight, and it creates creases on my skin.  when I move, the hose runs and breaks during the day.
I always wear hosiery, and this is the only time that I've had this problem.  this particular hosiery fits well on the lower part of the leg, the problem with the line not going straight all the way up happens only with this Leggs sheer energy brand.  they all do that.  (wife using my account)",B00008MORX
I love these pantyhose. They're nice and thick and take forever to run. I plan on purchasing more once the couple of boxes I bought get too worn.,B00008MORX
"The hose fie a little snug, but I can wear them.  I have been wearing L'eggs hoseiry for a number of years.",B00008MORX
Worked great for my son's wedding!,B00008MORX
These nylons are great. They provide some support and the suntan color is not to dark or too light. I would order them again.,B00008MORX
They fit and the price was right.,B00008MORX
I like these because I do not like the tightness of the control top.,B00008MORX
Love my Leggs hose.  Only they don't have as much sheen as I remember them having.  But still they do the trick and I will buy again.,B00008MORX
These are my favorite and very difficult to find in local stores. I'm so glad that they are available at Amazon and for a good price too.,B00008MORX
"History/Experience:
I have struggled to find a good sports bra for my large chest since I was in middle school. Growing up playing soccer really made it hard to adjust when things started bouncing more. My mom (being smaller busted) also struggled to help me find a solution. Keep in mind, this was before the internet/google/amazon days. I finally settled on ""doubling-up"" when getting ready for a game or practice - which was a daily occurrence. Looking back now, that was terrible. I could barely breath correctly, getting in and out of two very tight bras was a nightmare not to mention quite embarrassing.  So, playing soccer ended soon after I became more full-figured.

Recently (at age 23) I started running, having my new sports bra from the sporting store, made ""specifically for larger breasts"". Well, that was a crock. Sorry, but bras off the shelf just don't cut it. After researching and reading about several of the newer sports bras on the market, I decided upon the Enell. I was careful not to get my hopes up too much however, because I didn't I could ever wear something that truly cut out the bouncing, but I remained hopeful. I measured, remeasured and finally ordered my new bra. As soon as it came, I had to go run around the neighborhood to give it a try. Oh, the joy of running!

The Real Product Review:
I am VERY HAPPY with the Enell. I can finally jog/run and truly enjoy what the sport has to offer, without worrying about hurting myself or being out of breath from non-stop chest thumping! The bra is quite tight but I think that is a necessity. I still move a little bit but since my breasts are held very close/tight to my chest, the up and down motion is very minimal. It took a few days of getting used to but now I love putting on my Enell (I always lay down to hook the clasps - much easier!) I love the tight feeling across my back when I am wearing it. I have even worn it all day at the zoo and other family activities. So easy, so comfy and SO worth every penny. The greatest thing, I don't have think twice when chasing the toddler! I don't have to worry anymore about wanting to enjoy an impromptu game of frisbee or catch at the park. I can run and play with the kiddos comfortably and confidently.

I would recommend the Enell to anyone with a larger bust that is tired of having to deal with improper support, doubling-up and not being able to breath, having constant chest-thumping when exercising, or just wants to feel better when playing with their kids. It has truly become one of my most essential pieces of clothing. As for the price: Yes, it seems expensive for a sports bra, but seriously, how much did you pay for your gym sneakers? I believe that this is just as essential to your workout wardrobe as your shoes. Maybe more since there are plenty of things you can do barefooted! Try it, feel the difference, find your stride, and go for it. You will be amazed at the difference proper support makes on your entire workout, attitude, and confidence! I have been using this bra for over 4 months now and still love it.

Note: I launder my bra in a lingerie bag (to wash and dry). It keeps other clothing from getting tangled in the clasps and ripping them out. This is a good trick for all of your bras since the larger size you need, the more expensive  they are! Also, I dry mine in the dryer since that helps to ""shrink it back up"" after use. So far, I have never had a problem and I'd say I have washed it well over 100 times using the lingerie bag.",B000093AIC
"I have large breasts, larger than some but not the largest, 40 DDD. This bra did not even pass the bounce test. I put it on and jumped up and down. FAIL. I like to run and do Turbo Jam and even Zumba, but with the way this bra is I doubt it would have even held up to my Zumba classes. Back to the drawing board. Does anyone know of any great support/sprt bras out there?!",B000093AIC
"I like being active and find that there are very few sport bras that work to minimize the bust, reduce the bounce and support a large bust. Also, it shapes the bust so you don't look like you have ""uni-boob"" like some of the other sports bras. Enell fits perfectly and is perfect for intense cardio like walking, running, cross training and biking. When I hook into the bra (there are many hook and eyes), I feel like I'm locking myself into equipment but it allows me to be comfortable while working out. No more 2 bras or bra plus snug sport tank top. I don't wear this bra when I'm doing yoga or pilates because the compression makes it harder for me to breathe in this bra. Overall, great bra and very durable after many washings.",B000093AIC
"I was impressed with this bra. It has enabled me to exercise more freely without being worried about my breast excessively bouncing around and having to constantly readjust my bra. Even though I like this bra, I only gave it three stars because it appears that I am in between sizes. Initially, I ordered a size four which fit fine but it was a little loose and wasn't quite as supportive as I would have liked it to be. I still had a little bounce while exercising.  Despite the slight bounce, this bra did provide a lot more support than the average sports bra. I exchanged the size 4 for a size 3. The size 3 was perfect as far as being supportive and eliminating bounce while exercising. However, my breasts tend to spill out a little at the top which meant I constantly had to stop in the middle of my workout to readjust my bra.  If they made a size 3 1/2 I would have the perfect fit. Despite my sizing issue, I highly recommend this bra.  It is by far the best sports bra that I have used.  I purchased another one because I liked it so much.

Update July 2014:  I purchased this bra two years ago.  I originally only gave it three stars, but after two years I have to say that this is definitely the best sports bra that I have ever owned.  It is also the longest lasting bra that I have owned too.  I can't believe that it has held up so well after two years.  I work out on average 3 to 4 days a week and this sports bra has stood the test of time.  Purchasing this sports bra was definitely a good investment.",B000093AIC
"I've got to say that for the money this bra is kinda meh.  There's no adjustment for the shoulder straps and the support is just ok, not bad, but not really all that great.  Putting it on and taking it off is not too much work, the bra is not uncomfortable, but overall I'm not that impressed.",B000093AIC
"I bought my first Enell sports bra over 10 years ago based on a recommendation from a friend.  I am just now having to replace it!  Finally after all of these years one of the eyehooks has come loose and it is starting to look a little ragged, but still functions!  I just bought a new one and am pleased to find that the quality appears to be the same as the first.

I am a 42D and like to exercise - going to the gym, and doing CrossFit-style exercise.  I have tried conventional sports bras, even doing the double-bra thing and nothing works like Enell.  It takes a little getting used to at first and almost feels too tight, but it supports and holds like nothing else.  I can do jumping jacks, jogging, running - and it is not uncomfortable at all!  I won't say there is zero movement or bounce, but it is so minimal it is almost unnoticable.

I swear by Enell and it is money well spent!",B000093AIC
"I have bought Enell bras before, they are great bras. Amazon had this bra with a great price and I received it in record time. I will order my next one from amazon as well. Money well spent.",B000093AIC
"Ordered this through Footlocker because ordering it directly through Enell could have taken up to 20 WEEKS!  Enell makes great sports bras, the best that I have ever found.  Not cheap, though.",B000093AIC
"Phenomenal Support
Excellent stability control
Best for running, bootcamp and major sports movement activities",B000093AIC
"This bra is comfortable to wear, but it does not work for high impact exercises. If this bra had adjustable straps it would be perfect. I wear a 38g and there was just too much bounce.",B000093AIC
"I love this bra. I  purchased 4 of them. According to the sizing chart I wore a size 4 (I'm a 40h),  BUT I read the reviews so I decided to buy a size 4,5, and two size 6. I figured one of these had to be the correct size. The size 6 won! I returned the other two and got size 6, and I am very happy with my purchase. Complete coverage, little to no bounce and total back support. Girls with big jugs, this bra is a MUST!",B000093AIC
"I will never wear another bra again! I have fallen completely in love with this bra, it has ruined me for all other bras. It's so soft and satiny, it definitely is a ""boulder holder"", I have never felt more comfortable than I feel when wearing this, it hooks so easily if done correctly and makes your breasts look smaller. I can wear this all day and not become uncomfortable, occasionally it chafes from the bottom but with a little adjustment it fits perfectly and comfortably. I would recommend this bra to anyone who needs the extra support like I needed, now I can't wait to order another one! It's pricey but well worth the cost for excellent control and support, once you go Enell you'll never go back!",B000093AIC
"I don't understand why this bra has so many high ratings. The arm hole is huge and, for me, even though the band was tight around my rib cage the arms and upper part of the bra were way too loose. Weird and not very comfortable. Returning it!",B000093AIC
"I'm a 38H and work out daily
This is the ONLY bra that works for me - I have used it for years .",B000093AIC
"The only bra for a full figure woman intending to be active. Love it. A little difficult to put on, but once it is on everything stays in place. Not comfortable for all day wear; just for a workout",B000093AIC
"Firstly, this is my boyfriends amazon.
Secondly i saw this bra on Ashley Graham. She posted about it on Instagram..

I was instantly interested, as i've been looking for a really good sports bra. I am a 40D/42C in regular women's bras, and have found that it is hard to find a really great sports bra that will hold my breast in place with little movement.

Let me tell you! this is the best purchase i have EVER made in my 30 years of existence!!!.
its equivalent to a corset... just for your breast and back, man i feel so secure and feel like i can jump up and down all day long, usually my boobs would be all over the place while working out as well as back and shoulder pain from the straps digging in.
I HIGHLY recommend this bra you won't be disappointed.",B000093AIC
This bra is the only exercise bra that allows me to jog.  INCREDIBLE HOLD.,B000093AIC
"I'm a 40DDD and for years, I had been searching for a sports bra that kept my girls under control. I had resorted to wearing two underwire bras, a (relatively cheap) sports bra, and tank tops with a shelf bra in them. Even with all that, these Enell bras far out performed my previous method. They're almost like wearing a corset, but you can breathe in them! I highly recommend to any large chested woman who wants some real support!

As far as sizing goes, you can look on their website. When I was a 38DDD, I wore a size 3 in Enell size. And now that I'm a 40DDD, the 4 fits me better (although, I'm hoping to go back to the 3s soon!!)

This is absolutely worth the money, as it works far better than anything else I've tried!",B000093AIC
"This sports bra does give great support, but I've had sports bras in the past that give just as good support and are more comfortable.  It seems durable and will probably last a while, but I'm not sure I would get another one.",B000093AIC
Ran small. SOOOO MANY HOOKS!!!!,B000093AIC
Keeps things in place when doing high impact activities such as insanity.,B000093AIC
Very comfortable! I got this bra because I was going to be hiking The Camino in Spain. It has been perfect for hiking long distances.,B000093AIC
"First, let me say that I have NEVER spent $60 on a bra before.
I am a 38DD-40DD and ordered the size 4.
OMG ... I am in love!

I have worn Playtex 4693 (Playtex 18 Hour Original Comfort Strap Wirefree Bra) for years ... probably 20 years. I love that bra - especially the wide straps and high(er) sides so I don't have side ""spillage.""

I bought the Enell bra because I wanted a sports bra that
1) fit  - Victoria's Secret is NOT for large busted girls
2) I could potentially use as a swim bra under my rash guard

As soon as I put this bra on, I said to myself, ""OMG, this is the most comfortable bra ever.""
I was so impressed, I actually considered SLEEPING in it!
I did decide to wear it to work the next day to see how I felt after a full day of wear.
I'm still in love.

The one thing I'm not thrilled about is how it smooshes my breasts and makes me just look ""thick.""
At least the Playtex made my breasts look like breasts.
HOWEVER, this is a SPORTS bra - it's meant to hold those girls and so, it does that excellently.
I do have a little movement and bounce, but this bra is comfortable. I just cannot say that enough.
I don't think I'd fit into a size 3, but maybe someday.  ;-)",B000093AIC
"It's pretty comfortable, but something changed since the last one I bought?  I bought one originally that had NO bounce.  I then apparently went on a 2 year eating spree and needed to size up a size because the girls were popping out of the sides of the smaller bra.  Now there is a lot of space above the seam on the front, as though the shoulder straps are too long and there is nothing I can really do about it.  I'm using it and it works better than any other sports bra on the market, but there is definitely bounce because of the way it fits above the seam.  It's only a small gripe though.

Oh, yeah.  It does give you uniboob but it's a small price to pay for the girls being locked in place for the most part.",B000093AIC
"I so wanted this bra to be ""the one"", but unfortunately I was very disappointed. First, let me be clear... my breasts are truly a force to behold. I mean, I'm a 38H and it takes a nation of millions to hold them down - or so it seems.  I have had a Freya and Wacoal underwire sports bra that have worked very well in the past, so I know it can be done. When I saw the reviews and the description for this bra, I felt like it might be yet another wonderful one that I could add to the arsenal.  But it was absolutely NOT that bra.  I read tons of reviews regarding the fit and how to measure and I measured myself and purchased a 4.  I was smack in the middle of what should have been a size 4 based on my measurements.  When I received the bra I put it on and the band was obviously the right size, It was difficult to fasten across my breasts - so tight I thought at first it may have been too small, but I was able to fasten the bra and then stuff my breasts into it - maybe not the way they intended to get it on, but hey - whatever works.  When I had it on and positioned my breasts in the cups the first thing I noticed was the significant lack of coverage and spillage out the sides of the bra. I also had monoboob and spillage out of the top. It was just not big enough to contain my breasts. The problem is a size bigger and it would have been way too big in the band.  Also, it had no adjustable straps. I thought it was brand new, and the band was pretty tight, so let me try it out and see how it goes.  So I wore it to my morning workout with my trainer and it was just useless.  It loosens up super fast and I was just bouncing around like a pogo stick. I mean when he said run and give me high knees, he got high breasts too. My breasts were like, ""Seriously?  This is no help at all.""  That's what they said to me after the workout.  I have already worn it so I won't return it.  I guess what I'll do is wear a regular bra under it and wear it on top.  Like so many other times, I end up wearing two bras so as not to waste the money I spent on some inept, unsupportive joke of a bra that my breasts just roll their eyes and shake their head at. Sigh. On to the next.",B000093AIC
Works great for high intensity training and running,B000093AIC
"I regularly work out at my local CrossFit box.  So far this bra is very comfortable and definitely keeps the girls in place. If I had even an inkling of a 6-pack (or just not have my muffin top) I would even be brave enough to do the workout without a tank top on, and just wear the bra as my workout top. Just a heads up- and it's not necessarily a bad thing- this bra is shiny.",B000093AIC
"You will not move!!! It doesn't give the dreaded uniboob, it's in no way cute but that's not the point when trying to jog lol",B000093AIC
I love this bra. It is comfortable and provides amazing support. I've been using this brand and exact same type of bra now for over 5 years.,B000093AIC
"These reviews are spot on. Basically, it's a boob corset. And that's what I wanted. I measured myself before I went shopping and I was measured as a 36J (sadly, that's not a typo). Some women want lift and separate, I want smash and mash. And that is what this does. Movement is slim to none. They do run very tight, but in order to do its job, they have to. Probably the only complaint I've got is the horizontal mid-boob seams. They show through just about any t shirt. Very expensive too. I am not an avid exerciser (running especially due to bad knees) but this make me feel so much more confident as I have never liked being chesty. I will stick with this until I can fit into a NORMAL size bra.. Have lost over 80 pounds and looking to lose about 90 more.",B000093AIC
i wear 36gg and i bought a size 4..it fit perfectly bt it didn't help much with the bouncing..i taught it would have more than one set of fasteners so u could have adjusted it when necessary,B000093AIC
"Love! Love! Love! Look no further for a sports bra. I'm very endowed and have struggled for most of my life to find a sports bra that's comfortable and controls my breast during physical training. Either the bra has been too tight and my breast are controlled or the bra is comfortable but I'm getting black eyes while doing jumping jacks or going for a run. I received the bra in the mail today. Took off my champion extreme control and put this one on and I had instant comfort, the tension in my shoulders was relieved and I tried out a few jumping jacks and I was hooked. I've now had it on all day and I've played around with the jump rope and just fussed around the house. I'm more relaxed and have not once felt as though my breast are not controlled. Love!",B000093AIC
"Best sports bra I've ever tried!!! 8 yrs of track, many more in the gym, never has a sports bra been so comfortable!! Full support, no shoulder/neck pain like many others",B000093AIC
I just had the best workout today because of this bra. The support is unbelievable.  I will be ordering more!,B000093AIC
"I have naturally very large breasts and this sports bra keeps everything in place-you can jump rope and they won't move.  Fits true to size-reference size guide.  Wish it looked a little less like a girdle, but it's not like a show my sports bra anyway while I work out.",B000093AIC
"As a 38DDD, I can't run in anything but an Enell. I also love the front hook closure.",B000093AIC
I did purchase the bra. I really like it. I ordered a second one in a different color. I am 68 years old and am large breasted. Discovered that the force of gravity may have caused a rib to be dislocated. I ordered the bra and the pain has stopped. It took about a week for the pain to go totally away. My blouses and tops also fit better. I went on line to the Enell site and also talked with a representative from the company before ordering. The size was correct.,B000093AIC
This is the best sports bra I have ever had. The close fit gives better control of bouncing and quality materials allow repeated washing without deterioration. Worth every penny I spent on it!,B000093AIC
Love it! Been buying them since Oprah recommended it. Keeps the girls under control. Only thing I would change it where the seam is across the bust line. But I imagine it's there for support.,B000093AIC
"I have been wanting a breast reduction for probably as long as I can remember (I'm 43).  Being cursed with an apple body shape and after kids...well the girls have become more troublesome than ever and really are ""in the way"". I ride horses and compete and my instructor had finally mentioned that I really needed something to tame my DD's. And I couldn't agree more!!!  I have tried **everything**, and a good ""stabilizing"" bra is not something I would cut corners on and buy ""cheap"" (those of you with big girls like mine, know that function supersedes beauty and price every time).  I ordered a size 4 as recommenced for my 42DD.  Put it on...which is a major chore, but I certainly did not care about that one bit.  All it achieved for me was create  a large bouncing ""mass"" in front of me. Did NOTHING to control bounce. It was actually horrifying.  I hate a uni-boob- but could live with that if it stabilized and prohibited bounce.  No such luck at all.  It was actually worse.  This huge clumping-bouncing blob in my front looked hideous and offered no function at all. Not what I would have expected from a bra at this price point, advertising what it claims. I guess being short wasted combined with full busted= beyond control.",B000093AIC
"It's hard to find a GOOD sports bra when you have large breast so I was a bit skeptical when I first bought the bra. However, LOVE this bra! I go jogging every other day and I am so amazed at how this bra keeps my girls from bouncing all over the place.",B000093AIC
"I love this bra (I have one from when I was much thinner), but I measured myself exactly according to the manufacturer's website instructions, and it is too big.",B000093AIC
best bra for equestrian! Can only wear it for 4 hrs .,B000093AIC
"very long shoulder straps and small cups in the large size (4). makes for ""massive spillage"" over the cleavage and out of the arm holes. inadequate ""bounce control"" and very uncomfortable.",B000093AIC

Way too big I am a 38 c how can I return ? No return label?,B000093AIC
"I had this bra when I played sports in college.  So when i strated working out after having my son, I decided to get another one since it worked so well.  It does flatten the chest considerably, so it's not for style, but I am able to do the elliptical and all of my training sessions which include a lot of jumping and running up stairs without hurting myself with my 40H sized chest!",B000093AIC
Too much stitching on the breast area. I can't wear it with a tee shirt or thin top because you end up with bra lines.,B000093AIC
"Stopped  my back , shoulder and neck pain and  makes working  out a lot less stressful .  Material  lasts 4 plus years without stretching.",B000093AIC
The most supportive sports bra I have ever owned. I can finally run without being self-conscious!,B000093AIC
"When I bought this bra in size 4, I wore a size 42H in regular bras and it really worked to hold everything in place and minimize bounce. I have since lost over 30 lbs and I'm down to a size 40G in regular bras, and the size 4 still fits. The only flaw is the stitching across the front of the bra, which is highly visible--even through my workout jackets.",B000093AIC
"THIS BRA IS AMAZING. I used it for the first time on a run this morning, and for the first time in memory, didn't have a neck ache when I finished. I was hesitant to invest the $$ at first, but wow... Should have done it years ago!",B000093AIC
"TRIED 3 & 4 SIZE STILL SPILL OUT AND THERE IS STILL ALOT OF MOTION, ITS LIKE WEARING A REGULAR BRA FOR ME",B000093AIC
Really held my boobs (38E) in place. I have never felt so confident doing my workout and the fitting straightens my posture. Would definitely buy another piece.,B000093AIC
"Start from bottom hook, re-arrange your breasts as you hook up -- after you finish hooking, do a lst re-arrangement and you will stay firmly in place until you take it off -- purchasing my 2nd Enell Maximum Control Sports Bra -- need a smaller size now that I have lost weight -- wear it daily -- does it compress, yes it does, does it hold you in place, yes it does -- this is an amazing bra that does exactly what it states it does.",B000093AIC
Had to return product becasue it was too small.,B000093AIC
The Bra is good just too short. can't you lengthen it? I have a little bit of a tummy and the bottom of the bra rolls up which is sooooo uncomfortable to have to constantly pull it down all of the time,B000093AIC
Great bra!!! I own two now! I can now run and do all the cardio classes I want !,B000093AIC
"I LOVE my enell bra.  When your breasts are large, and you need to run, jump, or do any other type of activity that will leave you literally holding your breasts to prevent pain or movement, this is the bra for you.  I will say that I have older enell's, and it does seem the contour for the breast is more generous than it used to be.  The nice thing is, if you don't fit in their standard sizes, you can always take your measurements and they'll make you a custom bra for not significantly more than their standard costs.  If you take care of them, they will last you quite some time.  My oldest enell, which I finally decided to replace, is over 10 years old.",B000093AIC
"This is the only sports bra I have found that truly supports. Sure, it goes on like a bullet-proof vest, but it holds everything in place. It has made a world of difference in my workouts.",B000093AIC
"This bra keeps you still, regardless of what you are doing.  Great for working out, or for large breasted women that need a rest from carrying around all that weight.",B000093AIC
"that's what I call it.  It fits well, and once you get used to it, is quite comfortable.  It does exactly what I wanted - minimizes movement - which has alleviated my neck and shoulder pain when working out.",B000093AIC
"This bra is awesome! I have very large very real breasts and they make doing any high impact workout  a challenge. I'm doing the insanity workouts and The Enell holds them in place. It has a snug fit but it does the job well. Once it's on no constant readjusting needed. I've done the double bra, double sports bra, and none give this much support. The look of it is ok, I would probably not wear just the Enell and workout pants out in public, but I do feel like a super hero in it.  I gave it 4 stars because the price. Of course we all big breasted women will give almost anything the have a decent looking bra with excellent support but I am sick of always having to pay 10times more just because of genetics. Also just follow Enell sizing instructions straight from the website. Be honest with yourself when you measure the inches, you will be happier when you put the bra on and it fits.",B000093AIC
I wear the enell bra since 2006. It really support my large breast when I rode my bike.. I ordered it again. I have 3 enell bras that are best than other!,B000093AIC
"truly.... I would have paid pretty much anything for something that worked for me. I signed up to run a half marathon to honor someone I had loved, back in the day- I have never run one step in my life, overweight with large boobs - tried all the TJ Maxx. Marshalls etc junk on the shelves (and it's getting junkier - beyond pointless) .most running stores do not cater to larger women - saw the Enell in a search of *best sports bras for larger women* and what do you know - Oprah recommends ! I just went for it and have never been happier - sure, it ain't dainty and it ain't cheap - more of a medieval type device but who cares ? It is really what us girls need -  The 20 or so hook and eye closures hold you in but following previous advice I pull it around and do up three, pull my arms in and do up the rest from there. No big deal - I did run one time when I had forgotten my enell - let's just say it was not pretty....... will not happen again ! Enell and me will be together forever - we ain't so pretty but we are so proud !! Sizing was band size and some intuition .",B000093AIC
"Way too small. The sizing guide needs more explaination. I did like the feel of the fabric, but since it is too small I must send it back.",B000093AIC
"I'm a 38G, so doing jumping jacks is a joke.  I use this and I can do them all day long!!",B000093AIC
"As someone with a larger chest (40DDD) I have a really hard time finding quality sports bras. I have a collection of ones that offer virtually no support, but are good for things like cleaning (who wants to get all sweaty & dirty in a nice bra?), walking the dogs, and yoga. But if I'm doing any workouts that are a little more...active, this sports bra is great for keeping everything in place. Jumping jacks, running, (really anything that involves jumping), this sports bra reduces bounce more than any other I've tried. I've had mine for a while now and it still works great.",B000093AIC
"Okay, I normally wear a 40 band bra, and an F/G cup depending on the brand. In a Lane Bryant Full Coverage bras I wear a 40DDD. I followed the measurements and this bra holds very well, but I have spillage at the sides and the top. The band fit correctly and I honestly feel if I went up a size the band would be too big. For myself I will seek a bra with cups and not numbers. This bra is awesome if you are a 40 DD, (40 DDD the biggest) as the sizing chart states. I give credit to the fact that for the cup sizes provided was correct. I guess my ""girls"" are just way too big. I will keep it and wear a compression vest on top of it.  My measurements did fit a size 4 though, so for ladies looking for some serious hold, definitely get this.",B000093AIC
I was hesitant to purchase because of price.  I kept coming back to this bra after reading reviews.  I measured myself and purchased accordingly.  I was on the cusp of two sizes and ordered up.  I am breasted feeding and desperately needed the support.  It is amazing!  I am so happy I spent the money.,B000093AIC
"I have been wearing this bra for YEARS.  It is the perfect exercise bra.  Everything - and I mean EVERYTHING stays in tact while you are working out, running, power walking, whatever.  Washes well.  Please always air-dry.  Bra will last longer.",B000093AIC
The quest for a bra with truly humane shoulder straps continues.  Like Goldilocks I tried the first one-too big. Went down 2 sizes (following the manufacturer's size guidelines) - too small .  Went up one size - too large in some places too small in others.  Having to deal with so many snaps - it's work! - would be worth it if fit was acceptable.,B000093AIC
Really holds me down while doing high impact exercises and comfortable.  Absorbs sweat and keeps love handles in place. Hands down one of the best.,B000093AIC
This is definitely a top rated sports bra for cup sizes C or higher. No bounce what so ever. Just make sure you follow the measurements and order the right size.,B000093AIC
"I can run, do yard work, tae kwon do, and jumping jacks in this bra and the girls are as still as if I was at the computer.  Some people whine that it's not pretty, but I find this to be an irrelevant complaint.",B000093AIC
"I'm not sure what came over me, but I was talked into running a half marathon by my friend next year.  I had to get training asap.  I had done other high impact exercises in my existing sports bras with no problems.  I finally worked my way up to 5 miles (1 hour) and bam!  The underside of my breast were eaten up!  The skin had been rubbed off to show the white meat!  I was shocked that had never happend before, and I was in a panic to try to find something that would work to keep the girls safe.  (Instead of quitting, which I would normally do :-))  I searched the internet and read all the reviews about this bra and decided to order from Amazon becasue as usual they had the best price.  I went to their website to get my sizing correct and was a 4. Like another reviewer said, it is easier to lie down to put it on, and I was leary about all the hooks.  But, it's pretty easy to get on that way and it feels like the bra is holding you in place well.  I jumped up and down a bit and was disappointed at the amount of movement I still felt.  I expected the girls to be held firmly in place.  But if I went down another size, I wouldn't be able to breathe.  Anyway I hooked myself in and went for my first 5 miles.  No chafing!  It feels comfortable and the wide straps keep the bra from digging into your shoulders from the bounce.  The bouncing is limited, but not as much as I would have liked so I'm disappointed in that aspect.  But still better than my old sports bras and so far doing their job well.  So far they have held up well after washing.  I wash and then hang/air dry to try to keep them in good shape, because they are kind of pricey.  But so far worth it.  By the way I'm a 40DD.",B000093AIC
"Very comfortable, minimum bounce and no ""side boob""!!!! Love this bra. A little pricey but worth every penny. I will be buying another.",B000093AIC
The best support of any bra I have ever used,B000093AIC
"It feels a bit like wearing a vest but after using it on the treadmill, I am a believer.  Limits bounce and offers great support.",B000093AIC
Most comfortable bra I have ever owned!,B000093AIC
Feels like a breast corset! Difficult to get into.,B000093AIC
"While it definitely isn't the most beautiful bra in the world, it gets the job done. I have not had great luck with sports bras because I am in need of a lot more support. This definitely keeps everything where I want it and makes working out a lot more comfortable. When I did my spin bike workout, there was very little to no movement. This is the first sports bra where I have experienced that. It was great!",B000093AIC
Did not offer enough support for high impact exercise. Returned.,B000093AIC
"I ordered this bra to use at work. As a LEO, I spend a lot of time sitting in a vehicle or at a desk, and the back support is wonderful. I wanted a bra with as much compression as possible for under my body armor and this does not disappoint. The seams do show through your shirt, but that is not an issue for me since my ballistic vest goes over it. It seems more comfortable in the heat than a regular bra, which is great for the never-ending search for ways to keep cool in uniform.",B000093AIC
I went to Enell's website and measured myself according to their size chart and ended up as a 5.  I ordered a 4 & 5 to try on and the 4 came first.  It fit (I used one of the top comment's instructions on getting it on) but it had no support whatsoever.  I was expecting it to be tight across my chest and stop my girls from bouncing up and down but it acted like I wasn't wearing any bra at all; all I did was a couple of jumping jacks (hardly any high impact work).  My breasts are big but not perky so maybe that's why??  I'll order a 3 because I don't want to give up just yet but it's back to the drawing board for now.,B000093AIC
I like this brand of pantyhose. Worn it for years.,B0000950ME
Too weak. I am already on my third pair. I get runs in these after just one use. And I sit at my desk all day . . . and my toe nails are pedicured smooth. NEXT!,B0000950ME
When I was putting them on; 2 runners went down the front....Enough said....,B0000950ME
"i have been wearing legs pantyhose for a long time. my silky mist pantyhose, sheer control top pantyhose look sexy. my legs pantyhose go very well with all my high heels and pumps. i wear pantyhose all day and legs pantyhose nylons are one of my pantyhose i pull up. i also wear no nonsense pantyhose and other pairs of nylons and pantyhose, sheer toe pantyhose with sheer control top pantyhose, or sheer to waist pantyhose with reinforced nylon toes, i wear a lot of nylons and pantyhose and legs pantyhose will always be on my pantyhose legs.",B0000950ME
"When I pulled them out of the box there were strings running horizontally that were darker, they were very soft. After wearing them once there were runs all over and a hole in the foot, all I did was go to church. I paid way too much for what I got out of these.",B0000950ME
Good price arrived quickly were a lot bigger than expected but I still am able to wear them.,B0000950ME
"Light feeling pantyhose that run and snag easily. If they were not so fragile I would have given them 5 stars, but as it is they only last 1 or 2 wearings before I have to throw them away.",B0000950ME
I liked the fit. They lasted for most of the day but by the end of it they started to snag and I could see little fuzzys. This is my first time wearing or buying panty hose and in sunlight you could totally tell I was wearing them so idk if it's the style I bought with these but I was a little embarrassed.,B0000950ME
Love the fit. The color was darker than I anticipated.,B0000950ME
I tried on two pair and they both had got runs with holes. They were dry rotted. I couldn't even wear them. I've had cheap stockings that held up better. Never again.,B0000950ME
Had a run the first wearing.  A waste of money.,B0000950ME
They ran at the toe the first time I wore them.,B0000950ME
"Love the fit and look, Thanks!!",B0000950ME
I wore these with a costume. They looked great! I wish white hose would come back in style!,B0000950ME
"Perfect size and color! Very comfortable, silky feel and natural color.",B0000950ME
"As a caramel colored Black woman, this is the only color of pantyhose that perfectly matches my skin tone!  I'm so glad I could purchase on Amazon because it is nearly impossible for me to find in stores these days!",B0000950ME
I have worn and still wear nothing but Leggs hosiery for nearly 30 years but this was one of the worse pair of hose. Are you sure this products is made by Leggs?,B0000950ME
Only thing I'm bummed about is that both sides tore as I was bringing them up my legs.,B0000950ME
"The least was stomach control, I  prefer not to have stomach control",B0000950ME
"Love L'eggs hosiery, feels nice looks nice.",B0000950ME
Great product and a great value,B0000950ME
These run huge. Very scratchy material. Crotch is not lined.,B0000A3L1L
I purchased this item as part of a dance costume; it fit me as well as I expected.  Good product.,B0000A4FIJ
"Great, my kid loves it. Actually I love it. :D",B0000CC55L
Really cool jacket. My little guy loves it.,B0000CC55L
"My grandson loves it, it is warm, and he can wear it orange side out but prefers the inner pocket for secret treasures. Patches are delightful. He is a happy little man.  He is high normal weight, not tiny nor chubby but solid, and it fits great. Average height too.",B0000CC55L
This company is GREAT to deal with. The jacket is awesome quality. My son wears it ever day. Great looking jacket. Very happy with it,B0000CC55L
Bought for my daughter but the hat is way too small for anyone in our house.,B0000CFNJW
Cute chef's hat perfect for kids.,B0000CFNJW
"Looks great, it's a hard look to pull off in a regular catering kitchen. Haha, but you know, other than it being a little warm, even 10 hours into a shift it doesn't weigh down on my ears like I feared it may. I only wear it on event days now and you know, it's just a great quality hat. I got mine for 3 bucks, so I cannot complain.",B0000CFNJW
Excellent quality & great looking.,B0000CFNJW
"On the surface it's not a bad chef's hat.  it does what you need it to and looks like a chefs hat.

The lost star on this has to do with the velcro placement.  The ""hook"" side on mine faces towards my head, while the ""loop"" side faces away, this does have the unfortunate consequence of catching on my hair when removing the hat.  Had the placement of the hook and loop been reversed this wouldn't be an issue.",B0000CFNJW
A very well made and easy to use hat. The velcro strip makes it adjustable and holds well. I highly recommend it.,B0000CFNJW
"Feels thicker than I expected, but they'll be fine when I get used to them.",B0000CG3LM
A bit warm but it does help with support as described.,B0000CG3LM
I got a couple of pair of these Thorlos for Christmas and just had to get some more.  I use them for my workouts and my feet always stay dry.  They have just the right amount of cushioning.,B0000CG3LM
my feet are gnarly and my biggest pain in the neck on multi day hiking/camping/fishing trips into the mountains but these socks are effin foot gods these things kept my feet perfectly dry and they were so comfortable they're like space foam for your feet wow the difference a good sock makes is monumental once again these socks are a hikers best friend,B0000DYND0
"My husband loves these socks.  I got a couple of pairs of them for Christmas, and he was very very happy when he saw them.",B0000DYND0
"Great socks...I would love it if these were the only sock in my sock drawer.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SmartWool-Trekking-Heavy-Crew-Sock-formerly-Expedition-Trekking/dp/B0000DYNCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SmartWool Trekking Heavy Crew Sock (formerly Expedition Trekking)</a>",B0000DYND0
These socks are worth every penny. Comfort and warmth without wool itch or sweating. I gave these socks as stocking stuffers to all my family members and now they are all hooked.,B0000DYND0
"I would not have believed it if I had been told that socks could make such a difference in walking several miles, boots seem to fit better, and no foot rubbing or chafe, no blisters , AND , they dry overnight, AND there is no odor even after 2 days of wear, 3 maybe if it is not too hot. Great for at home in cold climates also.",B0000DYND0
Expensive but if you want comfortable and warm wool socks that aren't scratchy these are them,B0000DYND0
Perfect for cold winter nights sitting at home in front of the fire OR a long summer hike.  Great cushioning and fit.  Well worth the investment.,B0000DYND0
"These are the most confortable socks. However I bought these 'heavy crew' for a week long backpacking trip in the Grand Canyon thinking they'd be more cushiony when ive been using the lighter weight Smart Wool socks and had broken in my boots with the lighter socks. These will work well for people who are used to thicker socks or with my mountaineering boots. It was a mistake on my part to get the new heavy crews for the first time on a long trip ... but after my trip and a blister on my arch from the friction of a thicker sock than I'm used to, I been wearing these around like slipper socks or with my crocs. So comfy. I'm sticking with the lighter weight smart wool socks for my regular hiking boots. But it was my mistake so not sure it's fair to lower a point, especially when these socks are so comfortable for other uses I don't regret buying them now that my trip is over and im using them for other things other than with my regular hiking boots. Smart wool always makes high quality socks. Just need to choose the right kind for your specific use. As a backpacker/hiker/mountaineer I should have known better.",B0000DYND0
"Comfortable and well-made. Be sure to look at the size chart and, if you're close, get the next size larger.",B0000DYND0
Love these socks! I am an avid hiker and actually wear both these & my hiking boots every day. These SmartWool socks are extra thick and comfy and last for years - I have a collection of them & have finally had to start tossing out the old ones (that are 5+ years old) in favor of replacing them with these. They keep my feet warm & dry without overheating.,B0000DYND0
I have worn SmartWool socks for a long time. I ordered a different color this time (Brown) and this pair is definitely too too too small. Why is there a difference in size when ordering the same size in a different color??????,B0000DYND0
Love the padded sole.  Warm and comfy,B0000DYND0
They do not last. They wear through much faster than comparably priced socks. Way too expensive for the short period of time before they establish holes.,B0000DYND0
Smart Wool make the best socks on the planet.,B0000DYND0
Great product Highly recommend them,B0000DYND0
Purchased these for my brother that has neuropathy and complains endlessly about cold feet. He reported that the size was perfect and they were warm. Pricey but he liked them.,B0000DYND0
Best socks ever very comfortable,B0000DYND0
"There wasn't anything wrong with the socks, they were too thin for my taste. REI socks are much thicker and had hope to replace them.",B0000DYND0
Excellent socks do not wash in hot or dry hot,B0000DYND0
these are heavy duty which is a plus for this winter's excessive cold. I wear them with summer shoes and my feet still stay warm.,B0000DYND0
"Excellent warmth and fit. Even when it's in the low single digit temps, these socks keep my feet warm.",B0000DYND0
Very cushioning for one's feet when hiking!,B0000DYND0
Perfect socks for a cool tile floor.  I live in these things all winter long,B0000DYND0
"Bought these for my husband and they are warm but are wearing fast and ""pilling"" over the whole sock. Have only had them a little over a month and haven't used them that much. Can't return them as the time is over a month- was out of town. Not too happy with these:-(",B0000DYND0
"I wear the socks at work where Im outside occasionally in the cold, very warm and fit fine, they do not itch.",B0000DYND0
Wore these as a second layer sock (liner + inner sock + outer sock) on Kilimanjaro summit.  Solid.,B0000DYND0
"love them, have several pairs .",B0000DYND0
I wore these socks on a business trip to Chicago and the outdoor temperature was -12.  My feet were very warm.,B0000DYND0
Wear them all the time here in Maine. As good as moccasins - even better with them. Super under boots! No more cold feet.,B0000DYND0
"These socks are great!  Experiment with the different socks weights from this brand, and find the ones you like.  I use the heavy crew for all long hikes, including during the summer months.  I value the protection over comfort.  Pair with other layers such as thin toe socks to add even more comfort for those long treks.  I own 9 pairs of these.",B0000DYND0
"These socks are awesome.  I wear them with Lowe hiking boots and I have eliminated hotspots.  I volunteer with a SAR team and hike on my own. Ive probably put 30 miles on 4 pair in January, including 13 yesterday.  They are thick and while they are wicking, you need to carry an extra pair or 2 aand change them as needed. Probably not worth the money for a gentle stroll but if you're into serious hiking you need these.",B0000DYND0
"How do I love Smartwool? Let me count the ways!

1. My feet freeze from October to March,  no matter the weather. Once they get cold, they don't thaw until spring. Smartwool keeps them toasty, no matter the weather.
2. My feet used to sweat when I put on fleece socks. Them they'd get wet AND cold. But Smartwool keeps them dry.
3. I used to wear out my old socks and have to buy them again each winter. Smartwool seem to last forever. I've had the first three pair I bought five years,  and they still fit perfectly...not stretched out or baggy.
4. Smartwool socks are not cheap, but I will continue to buy them because they are simply the best socks I've ever had.",B0000DYND0
"Great socks!! I wear them in the evenings when its cold, and I want to keep my feet warm. Hmmm.",B0000DYND0
"extremely warm, but thick so getting them  into shoes is difficult.",B0000DYND0
No blisters and keeps feet comfortable,B0000DYND0
"Super warm, well-made! No need for slippers at home and warm outside! THANKS!",B0000DYND0
Not to heavy and very warm indeed!,B0000DYND0
the socks are comfortable and warm would buy them again,B0000DYND0
The pair of socks was twenty dollars - I expected that these would be very comfortable hiking socks but I was disappointed.  They are the correct size and fit but they bunch in my hiking shoes and the padding all seems to be in the wrong place.  They make my feet very uncomfortable and would cause real damage if used on a hiking trip.,B0000DYND0
Buy these each winter.  The best sock for keeping warm I have ever found,B0000DYND0
Love everything about them. Ive been wearing them for years,B0000DYND0
Exactly as advertised.  Like walking on carpet.,B0000DYND0
"Not as good at cold weather protection as hoped, good quality, too expensive, Carhartt and  Dickies cold weather socks are a better deal and work as well.",B0000DYND0
soft thick very nice.. and since wool can wear over and over and won't stink for a while.. good for hiking too..,B0000DYND0
My husband loves these socks. They are expensive but worth the price. Very cushiony and keep his feet dry and warm. I just wish they could be bought in packs and not just individually.,B0000DYND0
These are great socks and never fail to make my feet feel better,B0000DYND0
"These are great socks, but not as warm as the heat holder socks.",B0000DYND0
Got these for my boyfriend and he loves them. Hes on his feet all day at work and they're great support.,B0000DYND0
Not really as thick or warm as I was hoping.  They fit well though.,B0000DYND0
Top 3 Best pairs of socks I have ever purchased. Extremely well made and very warm socks.,B0000DYND0
My girlfriend loves these warm cozy socks. Perfect for lounging around the house.,B0000DYND0
most comfortable/warm socks ever. you won't regret it.,B0000DYND0
"I wear these socks when upland bird hunting which means I walk a lot. They wick away the moisture, but keep the feet warm when not active. Worth the money.",B0000DYND0
"These are great socks, for winter, or even summer! Always warm, but in summer, not hot at all. My opinion",B0000DYND0
"I work in a cold environment, on concrete, wearing steel toe rubber boots. Love Smartwool socks and these are just perfect for my job.  Always warm and moisture isn't a problem.  These socks never fall and have worn exceptionally well considering I wear them daily for 9 to 10 hours a day.  Would highly recommend the Trekking sock.  Prompt shipment and arrived as expected.",B0000DYND0
"Greatest socks I've ever owned! Long days all weather, all environments, they're great warm wicking and comfortable. No itching or fungus development. Strongly recommend",B0000DYND0
The finest most expensive casual socks I have ever bought.,B0000DYND0
My husband likes these socks for hiking,B0000DYND0
"Comfortable, but do not fit my boot as well as I would like, and they do not stay up well or come far enough up my calf.",B0000DYND0
"Soft. Cushiony. It fits as I expected. I wore them throughout out recent vacation (several pairs) and they did help. My feet are not made for walking but these do help cushion and protect my self-inflicted walking wounds. I have bought several pairs now and will buy again.
April 2018: Just returned from a vacation in Paris. Wore these socks everyday with my Merrill hiking shoes. I lasted 5 days without blisters! This is an incredible miracle for me! I usually have blisters within 1 day, 2 at the tops. And, my blisters this time were minimal. I give credit to these heavy, cushioned socks. I just purchase 2 more pair. They are soft and heavy cushioned. Perfect for me.",B0000DYND0
Great socks! Expensive (maybe a little TOO so) but 'real deal' comfy and warm.,B0000DYND0
"This smart wool sock did meet all my expectations, and provided the warmth that I was looking for. The fit was just right and did not cause my feet to loose feeling while wearing them inside my boots. I recommend these socks to keep your feet warm in the cold weather. I wore them in 5-15 degree Fahrenheit weather in Fallon Nevada while flying in a MH-60S Helicopter.",B0000DYND0
"These effectively got me through the Inca Trek with no blisters. I wear a size 12 Nike and a size 11.5 Salomon GTX boot, and these fit exceptionally well. Very comfortable. Because they aren't entirely merino wool, they do smell after a day of intense hiking, but the nylon/elastic improves the overall fit. Recommended!",B0000DYND0
Love these socks.  I own many pairs and buy them as gifts for friends,B0000DYND0
Great socks. Good for 7 hours before having to change out for another pair.,B0000DYND0
"Great socks for active and leisure use-- I wear them often in the winter when out and about in the cold and snow.  These are also great socks to wear around a cold and drafty house-- they're soft and warm, and thick enough to be almost like a more pliable, flexible slipper.  Great socks, I highly recommend!!",B0000DYND0
"Wore these while wearing a Dry Suit. Kept my feet so warm while snorkeling in Iceland. These are comfy cozy. They are a little thick if your shoes fit snug, but perfect for wearing them in a Dry Suit.",B0000DYND0
Great Socks.  Keep feet blister free & happy on a 150 mile camping trip.  I'll definitely buy more if / when needed.  Great value for the money and did all that I would expect of wicking hiking socks.,B0000DYND0
"High quality, very thick, very warm socks. Great for hiking or sleeping in the snow. I've had mine for years and they're still like new.",B0000DYND0
"Good sock, especially for long hikes in rugged terrain.",B0000DYND0
"I intentionally bought these a bit large because I am at the top range of the Medium size and because I wear barefoot-style shoes I do not want my socks to be so well-fitted that they squeeze my toes. I would love if this style was available in a wider range of sizes, I feel like I'm right in between a Medium and Large. My shoe size is somewhere between 9/9.5/10 depending on brand and style.

Otherwise, love these socks! SmarWool is the best, I worse amazing thick socks like these through college and nothing has compared. So cozy and cushy on my feet!",B0000DYND0
Comfortable but look worn after just a few washes.,B0000DYND0
"Great socks just not for larger calves.  I love the socks but if the diameter of your calves is slightly larger than that of  a broom stick, then not so much.",B0000DYND0
As good as it gets in wool socks.,B0000DYND0
"Perfectly warm feet standing outside in 34 degree weather, ALL day.",B0000DYND0
"I love Smart Wool socks, and have for many years.  If I did have a problem, it would be that the large is a bit too  small, and the X-large is a bit too big!  Why I clicked on ""fit as expected"", it was because I have been wearing them for years and knew they would be a tad large ... BUT, they are one fantastic and one long lasting sock!",B0000DYND0
"These were a gift for my husband (Christmas 2016) and he loves them.  He's a big guy -- 6' 2"" and 240 lbs -- so these socks pad his feet and wear well.  They are also very warm.  I love them because they keep their shape in the wash.  Granted, I wash them on a delicate cycle and then hang them to dry, but that's because I want to ensure that they last a long time.",B0000DYND0
These smartwool socks are perfect.  I've worn them with my timberland boots hiking in snow and my Sorel boots walking around.  They keep my feet super warm.  They are the right amount of toasty.  I even sleep with them on at night during chilly nights.  I love that they're warm but not super bulky.,B0000DYND0
Don't opt for cheap substitutes.  Get the real thing and you'll never be sorry.,B0000DYND0
Really great socks. Feels like you're walking on a cloud. Kept my feet warm while trudging through snow for multiple hours (was wearing waterproof hiking boots). Definitely recommended and worth the money.,B0000DYND0
"Bought these as a gift for someone I don't know very well, as they are a staple in every warmth-loving men's wardrobe. He loved them and wears them constantly.",B0000DYND0
Very Comfortable....would recommend these....,B0000DYND0
"LOVE um, buying more. The really last and great for hiking or just wearing around the house on a cold day.",B0000DYND0
"Got a new pair of Keen Boots and tried every sock in my drawer and none were thick enough or cushy enough - until this sock! OMG - what a difference. Have ordered 2 more pair now. Pricey? Well, I finally got it that if my feet aren't comfy, it just isn't gonna work. LOVE LOVE these socks!",B0000DYND0
"These helped a lot with the harsh winter days at first. I have to both shovel and salt at work and these definitely helped. Never had to worry about my toes going numb. That is where the pros end. The durability was horrible. I wore these to work for a little over a month and holes began to form. Granted I walk a lot a work, but considering these were meant to be top of the tier winter socks, it was beyond disappointing. There is zero reason to purchase these socks due to the durability. You are much better off just throwing on a couple pairs of regular socks which you can keep in your sock drawer year round.",B0000DYND0
Have been wearing these socks for years and I don't think you could find a better sock!,B0000DYND0
These are great socks but darn tough is still a better brand sock then these. If you do manual labor and are in your feet all day then these are not what you want. They are very warm but provide very little in the way of arch support.,B0000DYND0
Really like these socks for wearing around the house and also in my boots when I'm out blowing snow.,B0000DYND0
"These socks were great!  I will buy more.  Fit perfectly, made my feet feel comfortable all day in my boots.",B0000DYND0
"Best leather boot sock ever. Period. 7 washing's and maintains its cushion and density, these are worn with my Limmer  and Danner Mt lite boots exclusively. I recommend this exact sock (Trekking) those who have bought expensive boots and are not wearing them due to break in soreness. This sock will help you break in those boots, by offering the most comfort. Just remember a little at a time and eventually you'll wear nothing else. The length of break in time is a quality, leather stiffness translates to longevity and rebuild-ability in my experience.",B0000DYND0
So comfortable and cushy and warm! I wear them to work during the winter and they keep my feet very happy. I need to buy more!,B0000DYND0
Heavy soft socks.. gifted to teen grandson for hunting. Good socks. Xl size 13 shoe fit well.,B0000DYND0
Smart Wool makes great socks.  I've had pairs for 8 years before they started to wear out at the heel.,B0000DYND0
"I bought these socks for my boyfriend. he uses them for work and really likes them. After washing, I would suggest air drying.",B0000DYND0
These are really awesome... really comfortable... you need a 1/2 size larger shoe to wear these,B0000DYND0
Kept me warm on a winter mt washington trek!,B0000DYND0
Great socks even for short hikes! Very thick and soft cushioning for your feet.,B0000DYND0
These socks have been received by the recipient as a gift.  He appears to be happy with the product.,B0000DYND0
Just as described. Socks are warm and durable.,B0000DYND0
warm and well built for the winter.,B0000DYND0
Best of the best when it comes to winter socks. I work in construction and wear these when it gets down below 15 degrees. These do the best job at wicking away moisture so that your feet don't get even more cold from a little sweat.,B0000DYND0
Best for warmth and moisture control.,B0000DYND0
These are hands down the best winter socks I own.,B0000DYND0
"Very thick, warm socks.  My husband
Over,them.",B0000DYND0
"Most comfortable socks for doing activities in colder climates for hiking, and cross country skiing, or xmas shopping, very nice. Highly recommended get extras when on sale and stock up. ",B0000DYND0
"Smart wool socks are the best thing ever invented, nothing keeps my feet as comfortable and warm in the winter.",B0000DYND0
"I have owned a pair of these socks for over 10 years. They are absolutely the warmest socks you will ever own(short of heated socks)! Warm, durable and good looking. Bought these for my son and he is sold also. I highly recommend these for any outside work, or winter play!!!",B0000DYND0
"Nice warm comfortable sock, feels good on your feet.",B0000DYND0
"These socks are pretty thick and nice ..... but .... I would NEVER HAVE ORDERED THEM if I had realized that you only get ONE PAIR OF SOCKS FOR $30.00.  Apparently, the seller thinks they are Neiman Marcus.",B0000DYND0
these are the best socks in the world,B0000DYND0
"The materials and workmanship are great, super.  The binding at the top is constricting",B0000DYND0
"Excellent -- not too hot, not too cold, just run small. Great for sleep socks. Needs something on the bottom to prevent slipping on wood floors.",B0000DYND0
High-end socks are wonderful and thiese don't dissapoint.,B0000DYND0
Really warm and cushiony. Love my smart wool socks.,B0000DYND0
Good quality socks but a little pricey,B0000DYND0
Warmest wool socks I've ever found! I wear them when riding my bike in temperatures as low as 38 degrees F and they keep my feet perfectly warm. They are incredibly cozy!!,B0000DYND0
"I've not been disappointed with SmartWool products, I work where the winter temperatures reach -40 degrees and it is essential to keep your feet dry and warm. SmartWool does just that and with the proper boots I'm able to work comfortably all day with minimal discomfort due to the extreme cold. Also I'm on my feet most of the day and it's difficult for me to find socks that are durable enough to stand up to my active lifestyle, usually I have a problem with the heels wearing thin but the quality construction of the sock lasts much longer than conventional socks.",B0000DYND0
"Wore these hunting around 25-35 degrees Fahrenheit and snow. Only wore thin liner socks, and regular leather dress boots. My feet were warm and never got sweaty. These are very thick, I'd only wear them when it's below 40!",B0000DYND0
These are the best hiking socks EVER.  Just like putting a cushion on your foot.  Love them.,B0000DYND0
I would give it five stars except that they wear out too fast. I cannot get more than one season out a half dozen pairs of these socks.,B0000DYND0
"Super heavy , very comfy, awesome as expected.",B0000DYND0
"These have held up very well in the past year. They are very padded inside, warm, and comfortable for New England winters: for everyday use, hiking, and as house socks. They also repel small amounts of water or dampness, which is pretty incredible.

The only cons are that they are supposed to be hand washed and they also develop a lot of pilling in the fabric.",B0000DYND0
Love love love SmartWool socks! I'll buy them as long as they make them because they really keep my feet warm above all others. My feet don't sweat either which is vital in keeping your feet warm.,B0000DYND0
These are the cushiest socks I have ever worn. I sent a pair to my mom as she needed some cushioned socks and has cold feet. She loves them too.,B0000DYND0
"If you are going to Philmont Scout Ranch, pick up at least two pair of these and rotate them daily.  I used these for two treks, around 79+ miles in length, and they are great. Used with a pair of SmartWool Liner socks, and blisters are pretty much eliminated. I have also been using them for boot socks in the winter, and they work equally as well in that capacity. I highly recommend them.",B0000DYND0
"Extra thick, love for sleeping & extra cold weather for my boots!",B0000DYND0
Husband frowned at buying wool socks in the summertime..........wears them everyday.,B0000DYND0
"Survived a 7 days expedition, 3+ days I was mostly crossing rivers and therefore getting wet; somehow managed to survived without any kind of foot injuries, I think it was mostly because of these lovely socks. Great product.",B0000DYND0
"Good socks, but they run larger than I expected.  I am a solid 12.5 shoe and these are 12-14 so I'm a little on the small end (I think), but I easily could have gone a sock size down.  They stretch when you put them on and do not regain size until washed again.",B0000DYND0
"These socks are not cheap but will last a while.  Made of 70% wool, they keep your foot warm and provide ample cushion in the seam and the ankle.  There is cushioning offering significant impact absorption for extended backcountry excursions.  These are the kinds of socks I wear every day and wash every week.  They last a long time and keep their stretch ability.  Very well made, all of Smart Wools socks are great!",B0000DYND0
"The fit and feel are amazing. They do; for me at least, bunch up a little during long walks.",B0000DYND0
Can't get enough of these socks!,B0000DYND0
I've used it pretty strenuously for the last couple of years and it's still smelling great Great product!  Great company.  A++,B0000DYND0
Super comfortable and lots of support for heavy loads and cold temps.,B0000DYND0
"Prior to Smartwool, I wore cotton athletic socks on my treks. Blisters and pain. Tried synthetics, no help. Friend turned me on to wool. Much better! The Smartwool brand hiker socks are the best I've found. 4 ascents of Mt Whitney, many Mojave Desert treks and not one blister! That's why I only buy Smartwool.",B0000DYND0
"These are great hiking socks. I have flat feet and they get really sore when I go backpacking and these really help reduce the pain. They are really thick and keep your feet very warm. I have used them for a few days at a time and they have held up well, even in the smell department. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to protect your feet when out camping or backpacking.",B0000DYND0
"IMHO, Smartwool makes the best hiking socks.",B0000DYND0
Great sock for hiking the AT. No blisters. Quality!,B0000DYND0
"Always a perfect fit, these Smartwool socks are the perfect thing when wearing hiking boots. They are very comfortable for wool and have extra padding right where you need it. Also, they are made in the USA, always a huge plus.",B0000DYND0
summer & winter always I use this. thank you,B0000DYND0
Love them. Try a pair and you'll never go back.,B0000DYND0
"These were issued to me before my first tour to Afghanistan. All I can say is these were the best socks I have ever owned. Wearing boots 20 hours a day for a year, hand washing in buckets.... These socks held up for 3 tours down range. Very comfortable, durable, and made the list of must have items that I pass on to anyone I know going across the pond.  5 stars.",B0000DYND0
It's like wearing a warm wool blanket!  Only without the ichyness. I'm so going to wear these out as quick as I can!,B0000DYND0
"I have tried many high quality socks for hunting and general use, these are the best I have found. These socks are thick and provide a good cushion for my feet but yet are not bulky.",B0000DYND0
"I bought these socks primarily to use while skiing in Colorado for comfort and to keep my feet warm. These socks did a pretty good job of keeping my feet warm. However, they were a little too big for my feet which allowed them to keep slipping and moving around in my ski boots. It was very uncomfortable at times! I sized them according to the sizing chart provided on the SmartWool website but wasn't the right fit. I have a size 13 foot and it's wide. Therefore, I ordered the XL which states they are for U.S. men's sizes 12-14.5. I'm a little disappointed in this purchase. Hopefully, I can return these for a smaller size.",B0000DYND0
"Merino wool socks are the ultimate in foot comfort. Like my barber said once I gave him a pair as a gift. These are not socks they are house shoes.

Do not beat down, wick moisture, increased comfort, and cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Plus no more peeling socks off your feet at the end of the day.

If you are diabetic skip the ballyhooed so called diabetic socks and go with Merino wool. Couple these with some good waling shoes along with the 2 ounce miracle gray Profoots and you can walk happy.",B0000DYND0
:) great socks. Worth the money,B0000DYND0
Love these socks. there the best.,B0000DYND0
"These keep my feet warm and cozy while I am sleeping, or walking around shoeless at home.",B0000DYND0
"Perfect socks! Warm, cozy, well fitting and comfortable",B0000DYND0
"They fit perfect. They feel good. Smell good... Even after a day of strenuous activity!
Totally worth the money!!!",B0000DYND0
"Will not order again. Stingy protection. ""heavy"" ? What is heavy. Call it for what it is. An Ok sock, overpriced and not close to what SmartWool used to be.",B0000DYND0
"I had old pair of smart wools that are about 14 years old and still a great sock.  Didn't know the size.  I bought all three sizes to try to find the same one.  What a waste of money.  These socks are not even in the same universe as old Smartwool socks.  Your buying the name.  Worse yet, there isn't an easy way to tell thin, medium and heavy apart at a glance.  REALLY DISAPPOINTED",B0000DYND0
"Excellent sock, these keep your feet warm and dry. They also last forever.",B0000DYND0
"The Large is a little big for a women's large sock, but I love SmartWool!  I find most wools are too itchy for me to wear, but SmartWool socks are soft and comfortable to wear all day.  NO ITCH!  :-)  Just throw them in the washer and dry as usual.",B0000DYND0
Absolutely the best socks I have owned. They are a well maid and long lasting product.,B0000DYND0
"I purchased this item for myself. I love them, they are so warm and comfy. They are quite thick but I have worn them under my winter boots, garden boots and ice skates with no problem. Due to the thickness of these socks they add quite a bit of comfort to all of them.

I wear a size 7 women's  shoe and they are just a bit too large, I think I will order the smaller size too. The size I purchased, meduim, fits women's shoe size 7-8 1/2, so I am at the lower end of this size according to the Smartwool company's website. My husband wears a side 8 1/2 men's shoe (which is the upper end of this socks fit) so I may pass these (unisex socks) on to him, I think they will fit. If not, no problem, they do fit me well enough that I will definitely wear them, I was just thinking he would love a pair too!

"I love these socks, but I have to admit that the only reason I buy these socks is because the sheep are treated humanely and no mulesing takes place.  The fact that they fit so well, and are soooo comfortable, is an added bonus.  I walk 4.5 miles every day and these socks, along with SuperFeet, really make my walk a breeze.  I don't just stroll, I pound the pavement and average an 11 minute mile.  So, if is important to me that my feet are comfortable and free from pain.  As soon as I switched to these socks I noticed a huge difference in comfort, so these socks are not just for ""Trekking"".. Highly recommend!",B0000DYND0
One of the warmest and comfortable socks I have worn.,B0000DYND0
"I work in a forty below freezer a good part of the day, these socks are warm and comfortable, wool is the only way to go if your working in temps below zero",B0000DYND0
"As always SmartWool never lets me down.  I have some light weight ankle sock versions as well for the summers where I live.  I needed some heavy winter hiking socks though, and these do not disappoint.  Keep my feet super warm, but not sweaty.  Plus, the extra thickness helps out with trekking on all sorts of rocks and debris, so that's an extra bonus.",B0000DYND0
"My husband reports that they are just fine. His feet tend to be sweaty, and he is generally a very ""hot-blooded"" type. He said they didn't make him too hot, his feet didn't seat as much, and the socks kept them dry.",B0000DYND0
Very durable and warm. Excellent long lasting quality,B0000DYND0
"Heavyweight socks that keep your feet warm and blister-free. This is my third pair of these socks for hiking, very pleased with their performance. Turn insideout to wash, set dryer on medium heat, they will stand up to a lot of hard use.",B0000DYND0
My son-in-law just moved to El Paso where they will hike. He loves his socks. We were happy to see they came in XL.,B0000DYND0
I bought them for my son in law and he liked them just as good as the people socks he purchased before,B0000DYND0
"These socks are nice enough but they seem to weirdly attract my cats, who have never destroyed anything else before.",B0000DYND0
"I keep a clean pair of these socks on my nightstand so I can put them on first thing in the morning during the winter months.  They are soft and they actually keep my feet warm.  I know there are other socks on the market with ""high tech"" warming capabilities but they are always a disappointment.  These actually work!",B0000DYND0
"Very nice, warm comfortable socks which made my feet very happy.",B0000DYND0
"Wish I could get more ""large"" size.",B0000DYND0
"These are my absolute faborite socks for the Winter and cold weather. I bought these for sons, and one pair for myself. There are others out there that are trying to copy Smartwool socks, but are just imitators, don't compare to the real thing !! They last for several years too.",B0000DYND0
Application: Cold Weather Motorcycling: Good fit. Decent moisture wicking and odor control Very comfortable and warm was down to 32 degrees and did the job. Will most likely purchase another pair after evaluating under 32 degree riding. So far looks promising.,B0000DYND0
"Best socks on the planet!  Outlasts all the knockoff wannabes!  Keeps feet warm in the cold weather and dry in the humid summer months.  What more do you want?  Comfortable for me means I don't  ever think about 'em, Thai is, until I wear something else for a change and then I notice the huge difference.  I tell my wife and family, ""Get me Smartwool for Xmas or my birthday or don't bother...""",B0000DYND0
I buy these for my daughter who lives in Alaska and is always hiking. She says they keep her warm but allow the foot breathe and not get sweaty. I wear them on the rare really cold days in Oklahoma and I love them. Very warm and comfortable. We have been buying and wearing these socks for over ten years now.,B0000DYND0
"All I wear from Fall through Spring. I have a pair for every day of the week, and extras for laundry days lol.
These socks plus my redwing boots = foot heaven.",B0000DYND0
My husband loves these and want 1000 pair more! He's been using them for years! Great quality!,B0000DYND0
These are great socks. Very comfortable and warm. Great as boot socks,B0000DYND0
"Smart wool is the best, hands down. To keep warm in the winter, cool in the summer-under work boots they keep feet warm and dry , under walking shoes keep feet from sweating. My family wears only smart wool! Don't let labels fool you, however, if it doesn't say smart wool with their little picture of a ""man"" with a cross for a head! Seriously! It can't just say ""merino wool""...they aren't the same! And they are made in the USA!!!",B0000DYND0
"Most comfortable socks I have ever worn.
Bulky looking but compressible so they can adapt to tight shoes, amazing!",B0000DYND0
"Looks like good socks, but 70% wool (not 80% as advertised on the description). So giving 3 stars for the fraudulent activity",B0000DYND0
I adore these socks! From the moment I put them on...I don't want to take them off til summer!,B0000DYND0
"Man, this seems like a super high quality sock. I love that it's made in the USA and it's thick and soft. I""m going on a hiking/camping trip this weekend with temps from 35 to 15 degrees and night and we are backpacking in about 6 miles. That will be the true test, but I have a feeling I""ll be happy with these, plus they double as slippers around the house.  Great socks.",B0000DYND0
"These are NOT good for the avid hiker IMO, I'd consider them to be a medium cushion. They stretch too much and your foot slides inside the sock and the sock slides inside the boot. I don't know what the ""other"" make up is but it seems to lack wool and have lots of material that stretches and is slick to feel. It might work fine for light use but for hiking, not so much. It seems that good wool hiking socks with a heavy cushion are getting harder to find.",B0000DYND0
"These are absolutely the best boot socks I've ever worn....I've worn many brands of thick, cushioned boot socks, including Wigwam. Wigwam pales in comparison to these. These socks are primarily made of wool with a bit of nylon, and some elastane to make them stretch. In my experience, wool is really the best material for a boot sock, because it wicks away moisture and doesn't saturate very easily, like cotton or even acrylic/poly blends. I've found that my feet can get really moist in a boot, and a good sock goes a long way to making the boots that much more comfortable. I wear these all day in hot and cold weather in boots, without a problem. Wool seems to have a great property of being relatively cool in hot weather and relatively warm in cold weather, again, without saturating with moisture as easily as cotton or acrylic/poly blends.

I love the cushioning these socks provide, too. If you wear boots, the thicker cushioning is really nice to have. Smartwool makes thinner cushioned, ""hiking"" socks, but I like these thicker cushioned ""trekking"" socks, better. They're so soft and and fit well so as not to cause any blisters. I've never gotten a blister or any other foot skin problems from these socks. I highly recommend these socks. I wear them with Red Wing boots, and they really make my feet feel so nice. They're definitely worth the price.",B0000DYND0
"I bought these for my brother for Christmas because I love my Smartwool socks do much. They are comfortable, warm and last a long time.",B0000DYND0
"I'm 74 years old and have always had a problem with quickly getting cold hands and feet.  My problem is with excessive sweating. Here in Northern Maine in early Fall it gets colder as days go by. I went hunting and wore my smart wool socks and gloves a whole day and was warm and comfortable all day long. I took my boots off at night and I was anxious to see if my feet and socks were wet. To my surprise they were not wet. My hands were the same way. So I suggest to anyone that if you have the same problem that I had you may try buying one pair of socks and trying them out. I bought 3 pairs with my first order and I'm 100% satisfied. Thank You Amazon, Roger Belanger",B0000DYND0
"Great socks. Warm, soft comfortable. Will be buying several more pair!",B0000DYND0
Had one pair given to me as a gift a couple years ago... now it's all I wear.  SmartWool is hands down the best socks I've ever owned.,B0000DYND0
"Very loose, not snug in the arch like my other SmartWools. Ball of foot is not as thick as my medium-weight hiking socks. Loose stitches, can't even see the logo completely on one sock. Sent from the UK, so it would cost me $21.00 to return for a refund, so I am stuck with them. Not sure why they are so different from others I have. Warning others to check carefully about where your items come from, to avoid very expensive returns!",B0000DYND0
"I always have a hard time finding socks that fit just right and these needed to be perfect because I was going to be hiking all day in them. Most adult socks are too big and the heel part always ends up around my ankle area. I have tried a kids large and, although they fit, they were a little too tight and the thickness ended up getting stretched out too thin. These socks were great. I wore them over another lightweight pair of socks and the fit was perfect. My shoe size runs about a 7 or 7 1/2. They were perfect for my hiking trip and my feet didn't sweat at all. You can throw them in the washer and dryer and there is no problem with shrinkage. Am going to purchase another pair. These are a great pair of socks. I highly recommend them.",B0000DYND0
"Good heavy duty socks, nice cushion.",B0000DYND0
"Warm, comfy socks! Would happily own 10 pair.",B0000DYND0
"The ONLY socks I will wear in the winter.  My feet always get cold in the winter, these are comfortable and warm.  SmartWool also makes a heavier duty version as well.",B0000DYND0
I was not impressed with this product as it did not perform any better than a similar sock I bought at Big 5. Big 5 socks were half the price as well. Also this took three weeks to get to me so don't expect this to arrive anytime soon.,B0000DYND0
Item just as described.  Will shop here again.,B0000DYND0
I bought 6 pairs of these 8 years ago.  They are thin in the heal but still functional.  Best socks I've ever owned.  Remember to turn them inside out when you wash them.,B0000DYND0
These keep you feet warm!  they dry quickly too.,B0000DYND0
"Stop looking.  These are the socks you've been seeking.  Warm, comfortable, with a little ""give"".  I hate normal wool, it makes my skin break out in thousands of itchy, irritated, little red dots, but these socks don't do that.  Hunting in cold Midwestern winters with miles of walking, these are the saviors of my feet.  They don't bunch at flex points, and they don't pinch either, so these work well as part of a multi-layered (with a liner-sock and/or over-sock) system for your feet.  They also work very well alone in spring/fall weather, they don't cause irritation, and seem to help prevent hot spots and blistering, even when damp from a bit of sweat.",B0000DYND0
"favorite socks!  wear with my hiking boots.  Toes will wear out within a year, but most socks do.",B0000DYND0
"These are not only my favorite socks but a favorite gift for Christmas and birthdays.  OK, not so good looking, but great for hiking or running and, according to ur family podiatrist, good for your feet.",B0000DYND0
"I thought heavy wool socks were the best ---- until I tried Heat Holders.  They are warmer than wool, machine-washable (though not machine-dryable), and have only one down-side.  They ""pill"".",B0000DYND0
"Great for hiking.  I use them year round.  Cushiony and your feet don't smell!  They do pill some, but who cares.  I like to wear a thinner pair under them for long hikes - otherwise I'll get blisters after mile 9 or so.",B0000DYND0
"Wore these for two days while hiking / camping in southeast Texas.  Feet were dry the whole time, extremely comfortable, and made me wish I had a few pairs.",B0000DYND0
"Bought this pair for my son who is in college at East Coast.  He loved it.  Nice and thick.  It's soft and warm too.  Very comfortable.  When I run out of gift ideas, he says ""it's always good to have an extra nice socks.""",B0000DYND0
"They're like walking on a cloud. Perfect for hiking and rucking. Work amazingly well with my combat boots! I bought a new pair of boots and had to go on an 8 mile ruck, wore these socks and I didn't get a single blister! Basically the best thing to have ever happened to my feet.",B0000DYND0
"The socks fit as described.  They are warm and not too scratchy.  If you are sensitive to wool, you may need to get some liners.  With use and washings, they are softer and fit better.  Would buy again - and probably will.",B0000DYND0
I'd recommend these to anyone who needs a good medium weight sock. (I wouldn't call them heavy) Seem to be long wearing. I have several pair and a pair of the lighter weight alas.,B0000DYND0
Great socks. I am intending to use them for winter wear in the city. Very pleased- I will reorder soon.,B0000DYND0
This is by far the best brand if you are in boots all day. It is the only brand my husband will wear. One pair he owns is going on three years and holding up great with constant use! Love them.,B0000DYND0
"These socks are great, I bought them because I was going to work in North Dakota. Make sure you have extra room in your boots because these are very thick.",B0000DYND0
"My husband LOVES these socks. His job requires him to often be outdoors and indoors in extreme temperatures (hot and cold) through out the day.  He also is an avid outdoorsman. He loves that these socks keep his feet warm and dry.  He probably has more than two dozen pair of these and other similar smart wool socks. We recently introduced my Father-In- Law to them and he also loves them. He is a diabetic, so taking care of his feet is important. He also likes that his feet stay warm and dry, and he doesn't have a problem with seams or an uneven texture leaving marks on his feet.",B0000DYND0
It is a gift for someone so I have no idea about the fit. But my husband likes the brand.,B0000DYND0
"In prepping for an actual trek in Nepal, I couldn't find my 'thinner' SmartWools - the Kleenix of wool socks - so I ordered and tried out this thick, thick socks.  Muy bien.  Tres bien.  Brilliant.  Excellent.  In any language you can imagine, these socks were excellent.

I wore 2 pairs over 12 days, alternating each daily.  What was great is that they didn't stay compressed after a day's hike in the Himalaya and didn't retain odor after a night hanging up in the lodge.

Can't say I'd recommend them for a day hike, but for something where you're out for days, they're great!",B0000DYND0
"Ever since a friend introduced me to these socks, I have worn nothing else when hiking. They have plenty of cushioning in the toe & heel areas for long hikes. I thought wool socks would be warm while hiking in the summer, but they seem to keep my feet even cooler than other socks (and it gets pretty hot here in AZ!).
I hike as part of my job, & also hike the Grand Canyon several times a year. These socks hold up really well, & don't need replaced as often as my hiking boots!",B0000DYND0
I wear these socks on my work boots all day. They take care of the sweat and odors that I used to get with my other socks. Highly recommended!!!,B0000DYND0
"I bought these for my husband who is a paramedic and on his feet all day.  He said they are warm, but keep his feet from sweating.",B0000DYND0
These are my favorite socks and they arrived very promptly.  Nothing keeps my feet warmer.  I'd happily shop with this vendor again.,B0000DYND0
My husband loves these warm socks.  He can work in the drive way cleaning snow when needed and not feel any cold. Would recommend to all.  They also wash very nicely.,B0000DYND0
"I have decided that I would rather buy two pairs of fantastic socks for my up coming hiking trip. These Trekking socks are great. They are cushioned on the bottom and they are holding up to all the abuse I can throw at them. They even stay up while hiking, though I roll them down to my boots.",B0000DYND0
I have a pair of SmartWool hiking socks that are over ten years old and they are still one of the best pairs of socks in the drawer.  I'm going on a trip to Europe and Colorado and will be doing a LOT of walking so I bought five more pairs.  When you think of how well these socks are made and how long they can last the price is worth it.  You can't go wrong with these socks.,B0000DYND0
"These are really excellent socks. They are warm and wonderfully comfortable. I remember wool socks in the old days, when they were warm but scratchy. These socks are soft. They are bulky, of course, so you will want shoes that leave room.",B0000DYND0
"These socks are shockingly expensive but I feel they are worth every penny.  I've never had a sock perform as well as SMARTWOOL.  They are warm and soft inside and provide excellent cushioning.  Also, they keep their shape better than any sock I've ever owned.  For people who have a hard time wearing wool, these socks don't feel anything like wool when you wear them.  They are extremely comfortable and aren't scratchy like you'd think wool socks would be.  I bought these to replace ones I've had for 10 years and are finally wearing out and I'll probably be buying more.",B0000DYND0
"I like the way they feel but in some of my shoes, they feel too thick (make the shoes tight).  Also, they shrunk quite a bit even though I washed them according to the instructions.  Maybe if you buy one size too big you would be better off.",B0000DYND0
"These SmartWool socks are great winter wear; warm enough to keep my toes toasty standing in the bus stop, and they breathe enough that when I'm indoors my feet are warm and comfortable, but not hot and sweaty.",B0000DYND0
"I've been using these socks for fifteen years now.  They are very comfortable.  Great for hiking or cool days working in my shop.  There are heavier and lighter versions available which I also have.  Unless I'm wearing sandals or dress shoes, I've got a pair of Smartwools on.",B0000DYND0
These are the heaviest socks and are so so warm.  I use them has house slippers.  Best socks ever.  These and FITS are great!,B0000DYND0
very thick...awesome for hiking! I've also worn these in dress boots that are slightly too big and now they fit perfectly! These socks make a hike much more comfortable!,B0000DYND0
"I was hoping these would fit in my hubands dress shoes to keep his feet warm while outside directing cars at funerals. Unfortunately they are way too thick and cannot be used for that purpose. They will be good for in his boots while hunting, etc.",B0000DYND0
"Admittedly I don't wear these for hiking, but for wearing around the house and walking around they are amazing.  I've often imagined what it would be like to walk on clouds and I'm pretty sure these socks are the closest I will ever come to doing that.",B0000DYND0
Price was average and the looks were great.  They are warm and keep feet dry.  Wear well and we love them.,B0000DYND0
"Christmas present and they are very much appreciated by the wearer. I would purchase these again, a bit pricey but worth it.",B0000DYND0
"These Smartwool trekking socks are great for everyday winter wear in the cold weather.  I wear them around the house and they keep my feet warm and if I need to throw on some boots and take my dog for a walk or run out, they keep my feet warm in the outdoor weather.  They are cushioned but not so much that you can't wear them with regular sneakers.  Smartwool socks are the best I have found for winter socks to keep my feet warm.  My only recommendation is to make sure you get the right sized socks because if they are too tight, even a little too tight, it will reduce circulation which creates cold feet.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a warm winter sock.",B0000DYND0
"Love love love these socks.  Just spent 3 weeks in Nepal and they were my Go To socks.  I used a liner with them for one day, trying to keep these sweat free, but I ended up with feet that were too hot  I really thought these were great as is - not one blister.  Buy them.  Use them for everything.",B0000DYND0
These socks are really great not only for being out doors hiking or walking but I wear them around the house too. Very comfortable.,B0000DYND0
Every type of Smartwool sock that I have purchased has been great.  They are true to size and do not shrink.  They last and last too!,B0000DYND0
These are the warmest and softest wool socks ever created!  I highly recommend them to anyone who lives in a cold winter environment.,B0000DYND0
"These were a gift to my husband who is outside and on his feet most of the day. He loves them as they are cushy and warm. Smartwool makes socks that really fit well, don't bunch up and wear like iron. They are also a bargain in spite of the price because they wear like iron and wash well. I bought a pair for everyone in my family.",B0000DYND0
Got it for my husband who is a railroad conductor who walks along side of trains in deep snow at work. He says these work better than any of the others to keep his feet warm in steel toe boots. I'm buying more for him.,B0000DYND0
These are very warm and thick. Slightly tight at the top - but that's great in keeping them from sinking into your boots.,B0000DYND0
"I tried your Smartwool socks when I was in Minneapolis at Christmas time. My feet were frozen in all the socks I had brought with me. When my daughter lent me a pair of your socks, it made a huge difference, and I was able to stand around the frozen pond and watch my grand daughters ice skating. I sent some to a friend for Christmas and he also loved the socks.",B0000DYND0
"Smartwool socks are the best for outdoor activities in winter.  While just lounging around the house the difference isn't that noticable, but when your walking around in the cold or shoveling, they'll keep your feet warmer than other wool socks.",B0000DYND0
"Very well made, durable, and stand up to multiple day wear while backpacking.  Just dry them out each night and they don't even stink!

Can't believe it took me so long to realize how much of a difference SmartWool sox make to my comfort and ability to walk much longer without fatigue.

Love 'em!",B0000DYND0
"Smartwool socks are warm, soft, and wicking in all the right places.  They are the only sock I wear when I can help it.  I darn them repeatedly to make them last years.  They are really great socks.",B0000DYND0
This is the most comfortable sock for backpacking I have ever used! No more blisters!,B0000DYND0
good socks. no sore feet at the end of day from hiking or work.,B0000DYND0
My husband and son love these socks.  They are the only ones my son will wear.,B0000DYND0
buy your self some of these !  Very comfy for around the house use as well !!,B0000DYND0
very nice sox. i should have bought the medium size for my size 11 feet.,B0000DYND0
"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL.  THESE SOCKS PILL TERRIBLY AND, WHEN YOU TRY TO REMOVE THE NASTY LITTLE CLUMPS, THEY'RE SO ATTACHED IT ACTUALLY PULLS THREADS FROM THE LINING OF THE SOCK.  ALSO, THE FOOT PART STRETCHES OUT SO BADLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET YOUR FOOT BACK IN YOUR SHOE/BOOT.  AND THEN...... THE CUFF OF THE SOCK IS DESIGNED TO FIT ONLY VERY, VERY SMALL PEOPLE..... MY FOOT AND LEG IS AVERAGE SIZE AND THE SOCK CUFF CUTS INTO MY LEGS BADLY.  SO I CUT OFF THE CUFFS AND USE THE BOTTOMS AS ABSOLUTELY UGLY FOOT WARMERS!  BEWARE OF YOUR TWENTY BUCKS!!!!!",B0000DYND0
Have seen better smart wool socks,B0000DYND0
"These are about as uncomfortable as you can get.  There is no way these socks can be made to do anything but produce friction between your foot and your shoe.  Oh, and if you try to pull them up a little harder than you are used to doing, they will run like cheap womens' nylons.  I found this hard to believe because I have never seen any pair of mens' socks run.  What happens when they run is you are left with a ""bald spot"" consisting of 100 percent rubber mesh and no wool.  I don't know what happens to the wool, but I know I couldn't  find it.  These are no different from all other wool socks in this class.  I tried all of them.  They all run: some worse than others.  With the Carhart brand I ripped the whole top section of the sock completely off.  They are all made of rubber mesh, otherwise known as elastic, and they are infused with little ringlets of wool here and there.  They are not knitted at all. This whole segment of the sock industry is nothing but a big smelly fraud.",B0000DYND0
I work in a cement horse barn every day for about 3 hours during the Northeast winters.  These are my go to socks.  Warm and last at least one season.,B0000DYND0
"I bought this for my daughter for snowboarding and she just loves it.  When you first look at it you would never think it could keep you warm, but it does.  It is light and comfortable and her favorite snowboarding shirt.",B0000E014L
"I purchased a top for myself and my daughter saw it, so I got her one also. They're cool, comfortable and great for wearing when I go for a run.",B0000E014L
"I have been chilly in the winter for a long time, and I decided to do something about it.  A friend had told me that silk was warm; in fact, hunters and outdoor sportsmen wore silk underwear exclusively.  So, I ordered the Thermasilk top to see if it would help.  It arrived this week; I put it on immediately, and I am so pleased.  With just a knit shirt over it, I have been comfortable.  If it gets really cold, I can add another layer, but the chilly feeling is gone.  I'm glad to recommend this to any other older lady who's tired of being chilly all the time.",B0000E014L
"As a rule, I am always cold. I have been wearing this top (Terramar silk pointelle) for years, and it never disappoints: The moment I slip it on, the most acute part of my chill dissipates. It's that simple. It is an amazing product, and I have tried them all in the past...Lifa, polypro, waffled...you name it! This one beats them all! Moreover, is is lightweight, soft, and very comfortable. I forget I'm wearing it. I highly recommend this product.",B0000E014L
"This is a terrific layering piece - lightweight and warm, but it still breathes.  And the scalloped, scooped neck looks nice under sweaters and other clothes.",B0000E014L
"This is a very lightweight top which is great to wear under clothing. It is very silkly feeling against the skin. Although when I washed it the first time using Ivory gentle detergent, cool water, and washed by hand, it lost some of the silkyness and shrank a tad. Next time I will use less detergent and very ""cold"" water. Just a heads-up to others.",B0000E014L
I thought I would be paying less for this scoop than I was charged.  I made my total order for more than $25.00 as I thought was as described for the lower price.  But I was charged the full price.,B0000E014L
Way too fragile a fabric.  Will dissolve in the washer almost.,B0000E014L
"Great fit, keeps me warm, and light wearing. It is like a second skin! Thanks!",B0000E014L
"This item fit as expected, but it is so sheer it is basically like wearing pantyhose material on your top half. It is completely see through.",B0000E014L
"The best for layering in cold weather.  Nice and thin, but very warm.",B0000E014L
This fabric is as thin as pantyhose. I have seen tights made with thicker fabric. It was not a nice silk at all.,B0000E014L
really warm and great for new england weather,B0000E014L
Perfect for layering and keeping warm.,B0000E014L
"Oh, such luxury against my skin...and it lays nicely under all my sweaters and tops.  I'm ordering it in white also.",B0000E014L
"Comfy, warm base layer. Holds up well with wear and washing. Fits well.",B0000E014L
It is thin and fits close to the body precisely because it is meant to be used as a base layer and not on its own. Excellent under scratchy sweaters made of wool or other not so soft materials.,B0000E014L
Helps hold body warmth without being too high on my neck.  Wear it as a layer on the really bitter mornings.,B0000E014L
Thin warmth.  I have both black and white and so far they have washed just fine.,B0000E014L
Light weight.  Great for layering in cool weather.,B0000E014L
the warmth but lightness of garment,B0000E014L
I love this it fits great and is long enough to tuck in which is very important to me.,B0000E014L
"I must have lucked out (after reading the bad reviews), because the quality of my Thermasilk is fine. It ran a bit large--the idea is it should be tight and go under other layers (though sometimes I put a small tank top under it). It's quite see-through and breeze-through, so its insulating power doesn't work unless something is worn over it. It's great for travel, weighs almost nothing and packs small. It kept me warm without bulkiness on a week long walking tour in February. If it got too hot it was easy to take off and store in a purse (especially with the small tank underneath it in case I had to remove it in public).",B0000E014L
"I love this simple, thin and oh so warm shirt.  Can't stop wearing it or telling friends about it.",B0000E014L
"This is a wonderful base layer material that stands up to farm life and allows movement without leaving me feel ""wet"".  For washing, I throw it in a large lingerie bag so I remember to hang it to dry - which doesn't take long, even in damp cold weather.  This is my second set.  My first set was purchased 3 years ago and still works fine - just needed a different size.  Don't let the silk fool you - it's really sturdy!  I do wish it were available in a v-neck style ( I know - who wears a v-neck in cold weather?  I do with career wear and a office that runs a bit chilly.)",B0000E014L
"Lovely fabric.  Keeps me warm in winter.  Not too tight or too loose, just the perfect fit.  I also like that the fabric is thin so i do not over heat.  I use indoors mostly, but some buildings are unheated and others are hot, so this undershirt keeps me at the right temperature.",B0000E014L
"If you're actually looking for something to add a layer of warmth, look for a different product.",B0000E014L
"I already own 4 of these.  The thermal sensation is really nice. not suffocating at all.  They are light, so it won't warm you up much, but it is a great first layer.  I use them from Autumn to Spring like a second skin.  They are delicate so you have to treat them gently if you want them to last.",B0000E014L
"Its cold outside, but I am warm thanks to this silk top.  Great product.  This is the second one for me.",B0000E014L
Loved the material but it was too small. I will have to get the next size up.,B0000E014L
It is keeping me warm in cold Chicago weather.,B0000E014L
This undergarment isnr Comfortable on my skin.,B0000E014L
Fits cozy and light but it keeps you warm. Not itchy or bulky under clothes.,B0000E014L
This silk top is just the ticket.  Very light weight and nice that is long in length.  Perfect base layer.  I may try washing by hand.,B0000E014L
Work great at keeping me warm during this very cold season,B0000E014L
I have had this band before. This color is just what I wanted.,B0000E014L
Worked very well for skiing. Giving a 4 only because the fabric picks really easily.,B0000E014L
"This shirt doesn't look like the picture.  It is very, very thin - see through - and doesn't seem like it would do much to keep you warm.  I've gotten silk thermal underwear before and it was never nearly as thin.",B0000E014L
Doesnt feel silk. Rough and cause itching. Fake silk,B0000E014L
somewhat small and I did not like the material quality.  I am returning.,B0000E014L
This Thermasilk top keeps me warm under my sweaters or sweatshirts.  It very important to layer during the Winter to retain body heat. Even though it is very light and sheer it does the trick.,B0000E014L
Material is nice. Fits under my clothes comfortably.,B0000E014L
Quality product but buy a size larger,B0000E014L
Makes for a superb first layer in defense against the cold.,B0000E014L
"I was searching for that brand for years until I figured Amazon might have it.
I absolutely loved those- can live without it in winter...
Also, it is not too warm when wearing it indoor, so it is really the best product I found on the market",B0000E014L
"I've bought silk underwear many times, and this stuff is cheap.  Isn't soft, and is actually rough to the touch.  Would not buy again.",B0000E014L
"Excellent material, fit, and quality. I purchased five pair.  I have compared this set to other silk set and you just can't get better quality than Terramar. I have their socks and glove liners as well.",B0000E014L
Fit well and slides nicely under another shirt!  Only adds slight warmth.,B0000E014L
"It is very flimsy. Did not expect this super light see thru shirt. I'd be surprised, if it survives the first wash. Adds very little warmth.",B0000E014L
"Thin as pany hose, won't buy again because I doubt they'll hold up in the great outdoors.",B0000E014L
Was disappointed with how thin the material was on this item.,B0000E014L
"Not very good quality. I ordered two of these, and it did not take long for them to rip and pill. I always washed these on the delicate setting in cold water and hung to dry. However, they are soft and comfortable.",B0000E014L
Very very thin and not very durable. It looks like sheer underwear that can tear any second. No durability. Will not repurchase.,B0000E014L
Would be better if available in petite sizes as arms too long but elastic cuffs make them workable,B0000E014L
Soft and comfortable. Great for layering.,B0000E014L
"I'm allergic to wool and other animal hair so all my sweaters are cotton or synthetic. Silk makes a great layer for the winter when you're wearing a cotton sweater! These are thin enough not to add bulk, but they do help keep me warm. I have silk long sleeve and sleeveless undershirts in black and cream. My last black one (at least 15 years old!) finally fell apart from so much use and washing. This one was not disappointing. Machine wash cold. Probably best to hang to dry, but I prefer to dry on low with a fragrance-free dryer sheet.",B0000E014L
This shirt will work if you are not going to be under 32F temperatures and even though you will need layers over it. The good  Bing abou it is that is very thin and it won't b bulk under clothes.,B0000E014L
"This is not a customer focused company.  We bought 2 of the thermalsilk scoop neck top to give to our daughter late last year.  She had forgotten them and recently retrieved both from her packed closet.  She tried both on and discovered that both tops have different arm lengths.  The right arm is 1"" shorter than the left arm.  We immediately contacted thermalsilk about the defective product.  Thermalsilk sent authorized the return with a return label.  However the letter stated that if we use the label to return the product than a charge of $10 will be charged to our account.  For what reason do we have to pay for defective product exchange???  This is a company that sells reject factory products and we want everyone to know that this company sells defective reject products and charges customers to exchange its bad product. Let it go out of business.  Its products must be second hand rejects and no one should buy from Terramar.  All be warned!!!",B0000E014L
"Very thin, but does provide an extra layer and comfortable under clothing.",B0000E014L
I am happy with this item it meets all my expectations,B0000E014L
Really nice product.  The silk keeps we warm when outdoors and is also comfortable under my clothes when indoors.,B0000E014L
"My wife likes it - warm, fits well, and very comfortable.",B0000E014L
"The Thermasilk shirts, as usual were perfect.",B0000E014L
I would love to recommend this product as it feels nicely on your skin BUT the black labels leave marks even on the underwear and stain the top when washed.  Definitely won't buy again.,B0000E014L
A great base layer under my jacket. It kept me very warm and didn't fit too tight like many thermals I've had.,B0000E014L
"Great layer.  Warm, thin and comfortable",B0000E014L
"This top has been great.  I've only worn it few times, but it has come in quite handy in cold weather.  Its very thin but effective and comfortable. If you're going to an outdoor event and not sure just how cold it's going to get, it will fold up quite small and is easily packable into your purse so you can change into it later if needed.",B0000E014L
"Extremely thin, like as sheer as pantyhose but more comfortable with a slightly more substantial weave. I don't undestand where the insulating factor is supposed to come in...it's just so lightweight!",B0000E014L
"Warm, stylish, fit as expected. I love this product!",B0000E014L
"Judging by the photo provided, I thought it wasn't quite as scooped....I had thought it was higher in the front. Also, the sleeves are very long, so they show at the wrist under whatever I'm wearing. I will need to sew it or cut the sleeves",B0000E014L
"I did notice extra warmth when worn under my sweaters,  I only washed by hand and hung to dry....Havent had a year and there are runs in the material that weren't there when purchased.",B0000E014L
Feels great on my skin. Perfect under layer to provide warmth and eliminate bulkiness that often comes with layering. Happy I purchased.,B0000E014L
This fit perfectly and totally keeps me warm in cold weather under another top.  I wear it alone when it isn't very cold and it's still comfortable.  I ordered another one and find that I wear them almost every day.,B0000E014L
"Well constructed.  Very lightweight, very sheer.  It did not add any noticeable warmth to the long sleeved shirt I wore over it.  Perhaps it will be good for wicking moisture.",B0000E014L
Great for this cold winter weather. Thin light comfy and warm!,B0000E014L
"Comfortable and thin enough to wear under a formfitting garment, yet still provides warmth. Just take care as the fabric snags easily.",B0000E014L
Perfect for wearing under sweaters in my cold office.,B0000E014L
Kept me nice and warm during a January trip to D.C.,B0000E014L
"Transparent to the extreme - have returned am awaiting
Post of credit to my account",B0000E014L
"Does a great job of adding an additional layer of bulk-free insulation. Hand washing  and hanging to dry, folded over a hanger, keeps it in good shape.",B0000E014L
"Great silk piece, keeps me warm as a thermal underwear.",B0000E014L
"Very lightweight, fit is good. Don't love lace at neck. Silk isn't soft. Doesn't shrink when dried. Not sure it is warmer than cotton.",B0000E014L
The silk is very thin and thready.  I suppose that is what Pointelle means.  I didn't know what it meant and ordered it assuming it was smooth silk.  It's okay for the price........but not worth more than that.,B0000E014L
"Have owned similar items before; still ""quality under garments"".  THANK YOU!!!  gwg",B0000E014L
Very well received and the person loves these,B0000E014L
"Great light weight under garment that really keeps me warm. It is delicate,
So take gentle care of it as
it easily snags.",B0000E014L
Xmas gift for my Mom.  She is 92 and is always cold.  She loves these.,B0000E014L
I live in a very cold state and I can't go without my silk thermal.  The is no other product that can exceed this product.,B0000E014L
Much thinner than other silks I've had,B0000E014L
"THIN, not thermal.
This product is more of a long-sleeve teddy. It is moderately transparent. It is so thin, it's hard to keep tucked in, and the long sleeves keep creeping up my forearms under my top layer. Thin would be acceptable if it were warm, alas, it is not AT ALL warm. It's hardly an improvement over no base layer at all. A normal-weight tank top keeps me warmer than this. Useless.

The photo below is with a bandanna just tucked under the top. The top is not stretched.

Why would they call it ""thermal""??? Seems fraudulent.",B0000E014L
Similar to the Terramar Thermasilk natural color undershirt but a little less sheer since it is black and textured. It is not soft and smooth. It is rough feeling and the skin.,B0000E014L
Very thin material - can puncture easily.,B0000E014L
It ripped a few days after I received it.,B0000E014L
This was not as warm as expected. I had used L L Bean silk long underwear and itinsulated better. I returned the item.,B0000E014L
I originally bought a medium after reading reviews that it ran small. I found the medium too large for me and returned it for an extra small. I tried on my extra small last night and it fit me well. I normally wear a size 4.,B0000E014L
This thermal shirt is great.  I have had silk thermal underware in the past.  This one seems to be almost twice as thick as previous shirts I have owned.  I love it.,B0000E014L
"runs about a size small-- doesn't show under sweaters, feels really soft and comfortable, needs care with washing and drying-- have been using this for several years and with the right care, it holds up well. -- just wish I could find it in a turtleneck.",B0000E014L
They were not a true xl.  the fit was more like a medium.  You'd best contact the manufacturer in order to not sell more incorrectly sized products.,B0000E014L
Not as warm as expected..material is very thin,B0000E014L
"I LOVE this! Perfect fit, perfect weight, moves well and not at all bulky so I forget I am wearing it. Not too hot but plenty warm. Buying another one right now. The best silk under shirt I own ... and I own a lot. I had no problems with washing but use cold, delicate cycle and air dry. I wish there were more colors available. Yum.",B0000E014L
"I much prefer the men's version, for the style and different knit pattern. But these have held up well, silk is an amazing fabric. They are so thin, comfortable and lightweight that you might forget you are wearing them. They are definitely too thin to be worn on their own. But as a soft, warm under layer they are great. I wear them to bed all the time, even in the hot summer weather. I throw them in the washer and dryer with everything else, no problem. I highly recommend them, if you like the style. I just prefer the men's style.",B0000E014L
Warm lightweight and of course its silk5,B0000E014L
"I bought this as a gift for my daughter. We were both very surprised at the thin fabric and that it was very see-through. My daughter does not like a turtle neck, but the neckline was very low to be called a ""scoop neck"". Not the best neckline design for a base layer.",B0000E014L
Fit was perfect.  Kept me cozy.,B0000E014L
"A light undershirt that layers perfectly beneath a long sleeved top and a sweater. It doesn't add bulk, so a weather appropriate jacket or coat can easily go over the entire outfit with no bulges.",B0000E014L
Kept me warm in colder climates. Fits smoothly under sweaters and turtle necks and no one knows you're wearing it.,B0000E014L
"Whoa, this is cool. So thin, but once you put it on, it hugs you. Very similar to cuddling with your boyfriend on the couch while watching a funny movie, but without the awkwardness of having to readjust positions with another human to maintain comfort.",B0000E014L
"This item is extremely thin and if you expect it to keep you warm you should find something else instead.  Side note, it gave the user a rash.",B0000E014L
Lightweight and warm -- just used it on a ski trip where the wind was howling at the top of the mountain and calmer at the base.. I was toasty at the top yet comfortable and not overheated at the bottom. Thin and easy to layer over,B0000E014L
Was perfect for my trip to the arctic.,B0000E014L
"Based on other reviews, I bought the larger size which isn't too bad - somewhat loose.  Both this top and the camisole are quite long and there seems to be a lot of extra material.  However, it does help keep your core warm under lighter weight clothes.",B0000E014L
Love these tops for wearing under sweaters in the winter. I would buy again!,B0000E014L
"This product is low quality and disappointing.  The fabric is very thin and whenever I put it on, I think it is going to tear.  I have had silk undershirts before so I know what to expect.  This is just too cheaply made.  Also, the silk is not soft - it is somewhat rough.
On the plus side it does fit as expected and it does keep you warm.",B0000E014L
"This product said it was 100% silk when I purchased it. When I got it, the label says it is cotton, model, spandex. It looks like the same product, it isn't 100% silk.",B0000E014L
Very nice lightweight addition to a winter work wardrobe.,B0000E014L
a little on the small size for a busted small women,B0000E014L
Absolutely as advertised - light weight but warm. Easy to layer,B0000E014L
Should keep me warm in the Antarctfic,B0000E014L
"Beautiful layering piece, very feminine, but sleeves were 3"" short so returned. Well made.",B0000E014L
"This is just what I was looking for. It's very thin, but that makes it perfect for layering under almost anything. It adds remarkable comfort and warmth to whatever I'm wearing.",B0000E014L
seems to be good quality.  I have worn this a couple of times and it's a nice underlayer for sweaters.,B0000E014L
"I would like it in x-tra large. :-)
great shirt...",B0000E014L
These Terramar silks are a disappointment. The silk is very rough/scratchy feeling. I bought two sets of the tops & bottoms but will return both.,B0000E014L
"Light weight,warm and comfortable",B0000E014L
"This shirt is very thin, and can definitely not be worn by itself. It's a fine undershirt. The sleeves are a little short and it doesn't sit very low. Does keep you very warm though",B0000E014L
"Very warm, barely noticeable under layers.",B0000E014L
"It is a lot more sheer (""see through"") than in the photo.
However, this shirt really works and is a great, comfy base layer for hiking in areas where the weather changes quickly from warm to cool.",B0000E014L
Very lightweight and great under layer.,B0000E014L
Black rubber addition  on item gives off black dye so all the item is ruined by black dye-Terrible product -remove black rubber addition asap-not needed and ruins product,B0000E014L
"This is thin, but it worked very well for a summer trip where I needed a little extra warmth sometimes. I have used this for hiking, for sleeping, and just as an extra bit of warmth. if you are careful with transport/storage & wear- a very good buy indeed.",B0000E014L
"The fit is a little larger than expected; I would've preferred the shirt to be more snug.  Also the silk material is very very thin, and I hope it can stand up to gentle washing.  I have to say though, for being so thin, I am surprised at the warmth it retains!  I'll be wearing this all winter as my base layer for outdoor winter sports.",B0000E014L
Works great!  Great first layer undergarment for warmth.,B0000E014L
"Perfect fit, lovely feel. Just what I wanted. Much less expensive than the L. L. Bean silk long johns.",B0000E014L
"I should have read the reviews before ordering.  Other reviewers talked about the sizes being small and also that they ride up.  I would consider myself a fairly normal shape and I have had similar tops before, but however these ones are cut, they do not fit well and are annoying in the way they slid up to my ribs although when I first put them on they are a reasonable length.  I wish I had ordered a larger size and possibly a man's one.  Every time I wear them I wish I had returned them instead of excitedly ripping off the plastic wrapper and putting them in my wardrobe.  In terms of keeping me warm, they are sensational.",B0000E014L
"I'm happy to have this thermal wear to keep me warm on those cold winter days ahead.  Wish they made these in petite, but being warm is my goal, not fashion.",B0000E014L
"Quality appears good, however it is VERY large for an extra small. For an under clothes layer it really needed to be more snug.",B0000E014L
"I use this and a matching bottom to sleep in when I am out backpacking in the back country. Warm or cool, these are perfect for staying comfortable at night. They add just enough warmth when the night air gets nippy and just enough breath-ability when its hot and humid at night. The  fabric can snare easily, but little snares here and there do not affect it's function in the least. The fit is perfect, the material feels good on my skin. It is very light weight and takes up very little space in my clothing bag. It's a perfect addition as an under layer if it gets chilly while i hike as well. I would never go on a backpacking trip without them.",B0000E014L
I can't be without at least 1 of these ast all times! They are cool in summer and warm in winter.,B0000E014L
"Great product,  just as described!",B0000E014L
It fits great and really keeps you warm,B0000E014L
"I ordered these for my daughter who went off to college into the cold country at Northern Arizona University. These are the best thermal shirts and underwear you can buy. They are not cheap! But, the money spent is well worth it. They are not bulky like most thermal clothing and keep you warmer than anything else out there. They fit well under all winter clothing, without making you feel like you are stuffed like a marshmallow. I ended up getting a pair for myself when I went to visit her. These are a great investment if you spend a lot of time in cold weather. They also make a great winter pajama!",B0000E014L
"These are fanstastic. I wore them ice caving and basically lived out of them for a week. With just one other layer, they kept me at the perfect temperature regardless of how fast or slow I was moving. I can't say enough great things about them.
The top is super comfortable and fit perfectly. Worth every penny. I'll be buying a few more for my next adventure.",B0000E014L
Love them.  Went on 7000 plus motorcycle trip and they performed just as I had hoped.,B0000E014L
"This is what I needed for a layer next to my skin under clothing due to a skin issue. Only thing, it can get very warm during the daytime hours.",B0000E014L
"I had bought two of them a black and a white but I lost? the black one so I re ordered it.
They are great under sweaters (no itching) under suits and even to sleep in on cool nights.",B0000E014L
"I wasn't sure if this would be too big or small.  I am a 38DD but size 12, 5ft. 8 tall.  I ordered the XL and it fit just right.  It was long enough, and
the sleeves fit just right and not too long.  It looks skin tight, but does have some give and stretches.",B0000E014L
Love it. Live in it for 4 days camping (heading to Peru shortly so trying out the stink factor). It is so comfortable. Warm. Dries fast. Very happy. Bought another one!,B0000E014L
"It was great, my wife was in Paris during
a Recent snow storm and said it kept her nice and warm, but very lightweight and not bulky ....",B0000E014L
"I liked this base layer so much I bought a second one. It's more durable than you'd expect given how sheer the fabric is. The elbows are a little nubbed up from...well, elbow contact with chair arms and such, but that's easily avoided by wearing this under a long sleeve shirt. It feels very luxurious for the price.",B0000E014L
"I just wore this top and pants as an under-layer on a 54 degree day outside under my running outfit. First, it is sooo soft! It reminds me of my favorite dance tights, but made of silk, and a slightly flowing fit.  I'd say the collar is just right -- not too close to the throat, and not too open. Once on, I forgot I was wearing the extra layer. It did not bulk up under an outer jersey. This is going to be my go-to for winter layering.  As soon as I can save up enough I'll get one in white as well--I just wish they had it in brown!  For sizing, I'm 5' 8"", 125 lbs - normally size 5 or 6 for a tailored fit.  I went for medium, hoping for extra length in the arms and torso, and this was perfect.  Another person not as tall might go for small, but tall women need long sleeves.",B0000E014L
"I just got these and really like them for an upcoming 100-mile hike, but I'm so glad I read the reviews re: sizing. I wear a size 8 shoe and would have normally ordered medium, but these socks in size SMALL are perfect.",B0000E014L
"Maybe it is just me, but this fabric is WAY too thin.  Think almost spider-web-like, also see through. I did not find it particularly warm, therefore, returned the product.",B0000E014L
"Great item to take on trips where the weather may be unpredictable.  No bulk--lightweight, comfortable and easy to pack.",B0000E014L
"Comfortable, flattering fit. 5'5 130lb purchased a size medium. Note the fabric is sheer, not opaque as it appears in the photo.",B0000E014L
Again I'm shopping for my wife at her request.  The wife loves them and looks great in them.,B0000E014L
"Got these for a daughter in law, who organically farms with our son, and she was amazed how warm they were. while still being breathable. I feel they are very well made.",B0000E014L
Very warm. Wear it with a wool sweater and it stops the cold.,B0000E014L
"I love this silk underwear.  I bought one last year and bought another this year, along with the matching bottoms.  They are light, but warm. Great for being out and about on a winter day without adding bulk.",B0000E014L
"nice layering piece.  It is transparent so cannot be worn on its own, but works very well under sweaters or long-sleeved shirts, and just adds a great layer of warmth",B0000E014L
Excellent quality - extremely comfortable.  I live in the south so the thin fabric is excellent for  light layering and warmth!,B0000E014L
Great for the horrible frigid winter days. This layers wonderfully under my sweaters.,B0000E014L
"This is a wonderful garment and I encourage anyone who lives in cold climes to buy it!  I would have spend a lot more at LL Bean if they hadn't been sold out, and this is a great quality alternative.  I washed it with my regular wash and it came out fine.",B0000E014L
"The fabric was very sheer, and not very soft. I don't like wearing it, and I wouldn't buy it again.",B0000E014L
"I love it, I wear it a s a base layer, when hiking or backpacking, I wear it when sleeping in sleeping bag if it's colder than a temperature range of my bag.
I also wear it just under cloth everyday in colder weather.
It's though run a bit bigger than expected and it also stretches from wear, but that;s fine for me.",B0000E014L
This is a great thermal layer.  Thin enough to wear under a blouse without being noticed.,B0000E014L
wear it almost every day in the Winter,B0000E014L
"Got 2 of these for my mother-in-law, she is 85.  These are perfect to keep her warm, at anytime of the year.  She is very small and thin. She wears these in the summer and winter under cloths.",B0000E014L
I ordered a size up and it was still smaller than I had hoped. I probably should have returned since I never wear it cuz its not that comfortable.,B0000E014L
Xmas in northern italy - this made all the difference. Keep me warm without the bulk.,B0000E014L
"Terrific, took it on my winter trip to Iceland. Bought two so I could wash one and wear one. Dried great overnight in the warm bathroom.",B0000E014L
My wife bought this top as a base layer for a sub-arctic trip we recently made. She found that the product worked well and performed as expected. A good buy!,B0000E014L
Best fit! Best quality! Best price!,B0000E014L
Wife loves the warmth without the extra bulk of bundling up with layers.,B0000E014L
"Soft, quality fabric. Feels very good.",B0000E014L
"Very nice item! Has kept me warm throughout my winter travels!  I love how light weight it is - fits perfectly shirts, tees, etc.  I only wish the scoop neck was a bit more scooped.  Sometimes the shirt peaks out from under my other shirts.",B0000E014L
"Fit perfectly, keep me warm, wash and dry perfectly.",B0000E014L
"Lovely silk layer. Easy to wear, smooth on the skin, perfect warming layer - very light adds no bulk. Only issue neckline a little high for buttoned blouses. Would prefer it was a lower neckline.",B0000E014L
"Excellent product and very reasonable price!  I was very pleased.  The fit was perfect, and it has not shrunk after several machine washings.",B0000E014L
"Love this long underwear. It's my favorite and I'll buy it again it again. Just don't wash them in the washer, use Woolite and hand wash and it will last forever. I still have a top that I bought 15 years ago. They are warm and light weight/ thin and I will never use anything else when skiing.",B0000E014L
"Lovely to wear, feels so good against your skin...you won't want to take it off!  Oh and it does keep you WARM!",B0000E014L
These shirts are so nice and comfortable,B0000E014L
Took these on my trip to Europe this winter and they were perfect.  Love the feel of the material and kept me warm.,B0000E014L
Love this silk thermal. Thin enough to fit under any top. Soft enough to not even be felt & supplies enough warm to be so comfortable.,B0000E014L
I love the warmth from these thin thermasilks. Mine never ran or tore and I was very rough on them. I evem washed them in hot water and threw them in the dryer. The black color faded considerably. Dont know if that matters if you're using them to layer under clothes.,B0000E014L
This is a little baggier than I had expected for a base layer. It is exceptionally thin. Has feminine detailing that some people might like and others wish it wasn't there. I find it doesn't keep me nearly as warm as other silk under layers. The quality seemed unremarkable. I tend to wear it for pyjamas instead of under clothes because of the fit.,B0000E014L
Purchased for my mother-in-law. She said that she has been wearing these for over twenty years and has always liked them. The quality has not gone downhill. Fits as expected. Ordered a medium based on her old one and it fits just like the ones that on their way out. Not bad for 20 plus years. haha,B0000E014L
"I'm 5'7.5"" and 128-130lbs and the small fits great.  Washes well and you can wear it a few times before washing.  I also bought a medium in white.  I like the small better, but both work well.",B0000E014L
"not smooth or stretchy like my other silk thermasilks, but it 'does the job' ok; sleeves could be longer, as could the length; it comes out when tucked in... price really does seem to matter for the best experiece.",B0000E014L
"Not tight fitting, but does the job. Easy to wash and fits under most shirts. It was difficult with tighter fitting shirts. I ordered a size S and it fit, I usually wear M in most shirts",B0000E014L
"Nice base layer. I have worn it a few times. It's comfortable, layers nicely under sweaters. It's breathable but warm. I will probably buy some more.",B0000E014L
Very light weight but functional for additional warmth,B0000E014L
"My absolute favorite base layer for everything! I wear it under work clothes and it doesn't show or cause static cling, and it's great as a first layer for outdoor activities too.",B0000E014L
I purchased this for my wife to wear indoors at work. Her environmental climate varies considerably. This is made from thin silk and is very comfortable to wear. It also feels comfortable in a wider range of temperatures than other insulated underwear.,B0000E014L
"Wear this white one more than the black, under ponchos, when cooler in the evening",B0000E014L
"Gift for a sister who loved it! No scratchy label, too!",B0000E014L
"Soft and silky but also thin and flimsy. I got a snag from my cats claw getting stuck on me and ended up with a hole, just like you get when pantyhose snag and you get a run. So be careful with any loose threads! I wear mine (top and bottoms) as light weight PJ's and as a second layer under clothing, just for the softness. (Helps a bit for fibromyalgia sensetivety) Thats about all they are good for. Hand wash with mild soap and hang dry to avoid ""pilling"" and snags. Im glad I got mine on sale, cuz they are NOT worth the full price in my oppinion, sorry to say.",B0000E014L
"Very cheap, scratchy, rough.  Too thin for warmth.",B0000E014L
Flimsy and cheap looking when it arrived,B0000E014L
Great products. The material was not too thin like some other filament silk shirt. It was warm enough but not too thick.,B0000E014L
Warm without the bulk. True to size and great price.,B0000E014L
I really like this shirt. It was a great price.,B0000E014L
Keeps me warm in the northern winters.,B0000E014L
Arms are a bit short.  A piece of paper thicker than this!!!  cold on.  so thin you can see through it!  save your money! i wish i did.  most pathetic thermal ever! plus front came with a snag....,B0000E014L
This is showing a ton of wear after only 3 washes. Low quality.,B0000E014L
"This product is perfect!  Yes, it is very thin but that is what makes it great!  It does not show under your other clothing and yet, it provides great warmth!  I definitely recommend this product!!",B0000E014L
"Purchased for my Mom, a Florida transplant who moved into our home.  After living in a warm climate for decades, Chicago winters were tough for her.  We couldn't have the heat turned up to 80 in the winter, because we'd be miserable, not to mention the expense.  So, this was the answer.  Kept her warm without the rest of the household suffocating.  Very lightweight and easy to layer under clothing.",B0000E014L
"I purchased this as an under layer for cold weather traveling. It's a see-through, fitted top and fits true to size (I'm usually a medium with a 36.5-37"" bust and the medium fit perfectly). My torso's on the shorter side and I'm glad this was not super long on me. It will keep me warm under another top. I liked the pric for this item compared to other brands I've tried that don't fit as well.",B0000E014L
"If the shirt wasn't completely see through i'd give it five stars.  It fits well, it feels nice to wear, just wish i could wear it on its own.  I bought it as a baselayer to keep me warm and dry for hiking in the winter, and it does its job well. Just wish it could pull double duty as a standalone shirt.",B0000E014L
This top replaced one that I have worn for ages and it fits and feels exactly like the old one.  I wear it under sweaters in very cold weather and under jackets for running.  It is light-weight and keeps me warm.,B0000E014L
"My wife is cold natured, so I bought her these for Christmas. She said they are very comfortable, lightweight and keep her comfortably warm.",B0000E014L
"Very cold,  but, make soft Pj's.",B0000E014L
"It is as pictured and as described.  It is worn under all materials, even for evening wear.  Warm without bulk.",B0000E014L
Destined to become a valued piece of winter gear here! The shirt fits beautifully and is wearing well.,B0000E014L
Pleased with sizing & warmth! Most comfortable & indeed lightweight! Thanks,B0000E014L
"Perfect underwear layer. Thin, light and invisible -- but just enough to trap some body heat and keep you just a degree or so warmer on cold days.",B0000E014L
Not bad for the price but very sheer and thin.,B0000E014L
I so love these under shirts.  I have worn them for years. They are light weight yet keep me so warm. I have them in other styles also.  I wear with dress and casual wear.  Great product will order them again.,B0000E014L
This is so soft.  Very thin. Perfect for layering.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  It fits nicely and adds NO bulk.  The length is good in the torso and in the sleeves.  I can't wait to wear it this winter and see how much warmer it helps me to be.,B0000E014L
"I bought it with their pant.  It was way too big!  I can't wear it under cloths but I like to wear it under Pj.  It's ligh, soft, and It keeps me warm all night long:-)",B0000E014L
I bought this product in a brick and mortar store previously that's why I sought it out a second time! Thanks! I love it!,B0000E014L
Exceptionally comfortable and warm. May need to order more this winter!,B0000E014L
"This is super light weight and was great at being not too warm during the day but plenty warm at night after a 20 degree temperature drop.  One thing to be aware of is that it is SHEER!  The picture doesn't really show this so I was surprised.  I was never planning for it to be my only layer, so it's not a problem for me.",B0000E014L
"Fits well, somewhat oversized which is great for me with my 38"" bust. I ordered a large.  What I didn't like is these shirts are very sheer like a heavy panty hose or stocking. You can see right through it, so it couldn't be worn alone. Good for layering underneath a sweater but that's about it.",B0000E014L
"They are cut a bit large, so not as form fitting as hoped. They are exactly what I needed (a natural layer for under synthetic materials), but are very thin. If you are wanting a thick/warm set, these are not it. If you want a soft layer next to your skin, they are perfect.",B0000E014L
"These are super soft but should only be worn UNDER things since they are so SHEER!
:-)
Very satisfied with the price and fit and hope they do well this coming winter.",B0000E014L
"I was a little hesitant to buy a silk base layer because of static but it's been worth it. It's the perfect thing to wear under a warm, but scratchy wool sweater. It's thin enough that you don't feel like you've over-layered yet warm enough to keep the chill out. I haven't tested them out yet in super cold temperatures (I'm in Mongolia so we'll see how this goes) but they've been super great for 30s and 40s temperatures.",B0000E014L
"I bought a couple of these undergarments at a sporting goods store last year, then found the same thing on Amazon this year for half the price!

I need several of them because I wear one every day in winter, in combination with other layers. I'd like to stress that this garment is very lightweight and rather sheer. By itself it would not be enough of an undergarment for me during a Vermont winter. I wear it under a Marino wool undershirt, with a wool sweater on top of everything. I'm sensitive to wool, and the silk garment acts as a protective barrier for my skin, as well as adding a layer of warmth.

If you're always cold, like me, this Thermasilk can make a significant contribution to your layering strategy. If you're warm-blooded, the Thermasilk might be all the layering you need. Either way, this is a very useful garment.

I think this item runs a bit small, so you might want to consider ordering the next size up. I buy a size small, even though I take an extra-small in most things.",B0000E014L
Exactly what I wanted. Lightweight !,B0000E014L
wow super nice to keep warm in winter . will wear this underneath as a layer got one for my daughter as well. haven't washed it yet but this was worth 3.29 as an add on item.,B0000E014L
The material was not as soft as I expected,B0000E014L
Thinner then expected and can see through.  However good re extra warmth and ease of Thinner then expectedwashing and drying while traveling.,B0000E014L
"These are very nice and such a nice low price, I paid under $7. It does not look as opaque as the photo suggests and it does have a feminine neckline (sort of a scalloped lacy pattern) so do not plan of buying this for a man like I did. It definitely looks like a woman's top. According to the size chart I should have ordered the small but I ordered a medium and it's perfect, just loose enough to be comfortable but still tight enought to wear under clothes. I am 5'9 130 lbs and wear a 34C-D and the medium was perfect. It is long enough, it covers my entire stomach. This is indeed delicate and care must be taken, I am washing mine in delicates bags, but well worth the small investment to keep warm in the winter. I'm seriously considering buying another set of these for my emergency bag and to keep one in my car for winter emergencies. For under $7 you can't go wrong.",B0000E014L
"I was very happy with the fit and warmth, it fit well under clothing.",B0000E014L
"This is just what I was looking for. I do wish it was available in other colors, plum or black. But it's delicate and fits well, for an inner layer.",B0000E014L
"I ordered small, was sent small & it seemed it was extra large.  It was so large that it might. Fit a 6'4 man weighing 250 lbs.  I would never again.",B0000E014L
"very very good,Exceeds Expectations.",B0000E014L
"Light, so effective for warmth without bulk. Like a layer of skin.",B0000E014L
"I found them a bit to thin fabric wise,",B0000E014L
"I love this. It's lightweight and warm, perfect for under clothing.",B0000E014L
"Poor quality, but does the trick. Fits well but very thin and gets pulls or runs in it very easily (like from my sweater rubbing against it). However, it is pretty warm for such a thin shirt.",B0000E014L
Very sheer. I hope it keeps me warm as I hike towards the glaciers in New Zealand.,B0000E014L
"nice & lightweight, buts runs small",B0000E014L
"Are these really pure silk?  because I have two pure silk dresses from Italy, they don't feel like this rough. Anyway, I will keep them, although they run large to me.",B0000E014L
"i LOVE these, i snowboard in them, backpack with them, no runs so far and two years in. lighweight, breathable, and Cute!",B0000E014L
LOVE these! I purchased two and shall be buying more...,B0000E014L
This underwear is really comfortable to wear as it's so light and soft. I ordered two camisoles as well and the long johns as I was so impressed.,B0000E014L
I love these and wear one every day. Being always cold I needed something not too bulky or heavy so these are perfect. I'll probably be purchasing more before winter sets in. Thank you very much.,B0000E014L
"These were a gift, and the recipient LOVES them.",B0000E014L
"This is a fine silk shirt for those days when you just can't get the chill out of your bones. I remembered liking the Terramar brand from back in my backpacking days and made sure to look them up when I decided I wanted some long johns for more sedentary uses. Do check out their size charts, as they are smaller than some modern sizes. But the garments are accurate according to their size charts.  Non-silk undershirts and longjohns just make me sweaty and gross and usually overheated. I appreciate the balancing and breathing affect of silk. These are thin. They are not expedition weight by any means.  But I think most people want to thin for general usage; I certainly did.",B0000E014L
"Its comfortable, but I didn't feel as though it kept me as warm as everyone says silk  does.  Now I use it as an undershirt under down hill body armor and its fine for that but doesnt have any real cool/warmth value as I can notice.  More comfortable inside out as the seams and tag made me itch.",B0000E014L
Very comfortable and kept me warm,B0000E014L
"These are great.  If you have never used silk long johns, I highly recommend them.  They are so thin they fit under anything and really keep you warm, maybe not at 30 below.",B0000E014L
Fits well.  Keeps you warm as a baselayer.  My only criticism is that it tends to wear out faster than I like....generally starts to develop holes after about one season worth of wear.,B0000E014L
Perfect for travelling....light weight and warm.,B0000E014L
"These tops were great, good fit. Quite a light weight, nice for summer.",B0000E014L
"I was up in at Mount Shasta for a mushroom festival. The highest temperatures were 85 degreesF and the lowest temperatures were 38 degreesF. The elevation of where I camped out was about 6000 feet above sea level. I bought a size 1 size larger that I normally am.
THE GOOD: This is so lightweight. I barely felt it while I was hiking. It wicked moisture from my body so I never got too hot while hiking. I wore this for 7 days straight and it did not smell bad or make me feel dirty. I can wear a t-shirt over this and I'll be warm, until I hit snow then I must have a jacket. Even though the top is sheer, I don't expect people to see through my t-shirt so I am okay with the sheer-ness.
THE BAD: Why are the sleeves so short? Please do not wear this by itself. It make a great base layer, not very good pajamas. It is sheer.
THE CONCLUSION: Overall, I liked this product. It did exactly what I expected it to do. I wish I can say it prevented me from getting a sunburn. I wish I could say it prevented mosquitos and other bugs from biting me. I can't say those things because I am not entirely sure if it was the product that did those things, or if I was well prepared for my trip.",B0000E014L
"A little bit looser than I thought it would be, but I love the material.",B0000E014L
"I ordered two of these tops, one white, one black for an upcoming trip where a base layer will be needed. I have only worn them, so far, for sleeping on cooler than usual nights (I refuse to turn my heat on in May!). They are light, comfortable and kept my body at perfect sleeping temp. They take a minute to hand wash and dry quickly (though they can be machine washed) . Yes, they are sheer, but they are meant to be underwear, not an outer shirt. You could put a cami or tank top underneath if you want to wear it as an outer layer. I got them through warehouse deals for $11.50 each. They were in perfect condition and am looking forward to using them on my upcoming trip.",B0000E014L
"I was waiting to write the review for this product since my first purchase. This is my second purchase so I don't need to hand wash every night to alternate them. I can wash them in washer by using delicate wash with other clothing. Theyve not shrunk from the wash.
Ive cotton and Heatech thermal underwear; cotton is thick, Heatech is medium, this silk is very thin & light. I like to wear this under cashmere sweater so I don't feel bulky.
Ive small size, they fit just fine, not too loose and not too tight.
One thing I want to mention is if youve purchased the cream color: Remove the black label and logo before you wear or wash them to prevent color transfer if you don't want to see black stain.",B0000E014L
"I bought this for my vacation and the temperatures were all over the place, including during same day. The pointelle knit is very pretty and feminine. The shirt is very thin and see-through but it does add noteceable warmth to your clothes. This shirt is 100% silk and silk is known for being comfortable in wide range of temps. I really felt that - it kept me warm in cold and cooled me off when it was warming up.
It is also extremely comfortable against your skin. I wish the neck was cut lower (and wider) though.

If you compare this shirt to L.L.Bean's it is definitely thinner and snags more easily. It's also 3 (three) times cheaper.

I think the sizing chart is very accurate. My chest is 36"" and I ordered Small. It fits close to the body with a little stretch (exactly how I wanted it). I could have bought a medium for a more roomy fit.

Size  XS (4-6)  S (6-8)  M (10-12)  L (14)  XL (16)
Chest  32 to 34  34 to 36  36 to 38  38 to 41  43 to 45
Sleeve  28 to 29  29 to 30  30 to 31  31 to 32  32 to 33
Waist  24 to 26  26 to 28  28 to 30  31 to 33  35 to 37
Hips  32 to 34  34 to 36  36 to 38  38 to 41  43 to 45",B0000E014L
"Lightweight and packable.  Breathable, great for base layer, and super-comfy.  Regulates body temp very well.  Love this shirt!",B0000E014L
Would order a smaller size next time,B0000E014L
It's a great liner. Light but warm and very comfortable.,B0000E014L
"This is so thin that it is see-through.  I bought it for a trip to Europe in the winter to wear as a base layer.  I assumed if I got hot I would be able to take off my sweater and just leave this on - not unless I wanted to provide a free ""show"" to those around me! It didn't provide noticeable warmth that I could tell.",B0000E014L
love this under-garment.  warm but sexy look,B0000E014L
warm yet lightweight.  very nice.,B0000E014L
"Love this - I'll be buying more.  It's lightweight but helps keep my arms warm when walking.  It was exactly what I wanted.  I live in California so it's not like I needed a super thermal shirt, just something to take the chill off.  This is perfect.  Fits fine and washes/dries well.",B0000E014L
Only disappointment is that I wish it was a little thicker as the winter was really cold.  Otherwise it was perfect. The style was good and was what I wanted. I gave it a 4 stars because I thought it was supposed to be thicker.  The picture looks opaque to me based on the picture.,B0000E014L
"I think it is too large, but I have elected not to return it.",B0000E014L
second one in 10 years...they really last,B0000E014L
"Thinner fabric than expected, so you have to wear another shirt over it, but it's comfy and warm enough.",B0000E014L
This is great when you need some more warmth without adding bulk.,B0000E014L
great for skiing. recommend it with a fleece and jacket,B0000E014L
"Nothing else compares to these for the price!  I had a 20 year old pair that was finally falling apart, found some inexpensive ""micro-fiber"" ones, but was NOT happy with them. Searched these out online, and have been very content since. They re super thin, so they fit under clothes that already might be a little tight, and they breathe, so you don't get over heated. Nothing else like them for that extra layer for warmth.",B0000E014L
"Wife likes quality, fit, and material",B0000E014L
"It's great, but snags a little.",B0000E014L
Great item. Ultra thin fits underneath most clothing with no problems,B0000E014L
Fit was right-on. Kept me warm all day and for a FL girl paddling in 20 to 30s that says something. Yet light weight and comfortable as a base layer. I loved them.,B0000E014L
Wore mine under a sweater and coat up on a glacier in Iceland and was totally warm.  Have worn it many times since in less severe temperatures and am always comfy.,B0000E014L
"Love this wonderfully thin but warm undershirt.  Perfect to tuck into pants without adding bulk.  I wear it under all my shirts & pullovers.  It keeps the Winter chill off.  The silk is much warmer than cotton & keeps me warm.  Washes & drys well on low, gentle setting.  It does snag on the hip area in the back when I tuck it into my jeans.  That is my only complaint.  I'll be purchasing another one.",B0000E014L
I like the silk skins very much--just what I wanted and expected.,B0000E014L
Not meant for extreme cold but comfortable for moderate cold.  Still comfortable to wear,B0000E014L
Good fit and quality.  Keeps me warm and toasty.,B0000E014L
"This thermasilk top is very comfortable.  I think the price is too high, however, and would not order it again.",B0000E014L
Works well. A little thin but good under light weight clothes.,B0000E014L
Excellent merchandise.  Exactly as described.,B0000E014L
"I could not get thru an Ohio winter without this underwear....it also kept me warm at the Mardi Gras (which wasn't quite as warm as
I expected.)  Silk underwear is a must for real light-weight comfort.",B0000E014L
"I love it, it is super thin bur warm. the only thing you need to know - it is semi-transparent, not like in the picture.",B0000E014L
Perfect fit and very comfortable.,B0000E014L
wow....wonderful weightless...washes well...and very warming...i did repurchase and will recommend this to friends and family...love it..,B0000E014L
My mom loves it. She happy-I happy. thanks,B0000E014L
Comfortable.  Can wear under nearly anything since it's not bulky.,B0000E014L
"Fits well, works well, and useful on cold days outdoors (or as an undergarment under a coarse wool sweater!)",B0000E014L
Good quality for the price. Fit is good. Will order again.,B0000E014L
"Love this. I bought one last year and got more this year. If you live in a cool area, this light weight silk undie will keep you a bit warmer if
you wear it as an undershirt. You can use any silk blouse to keep you warm under clothing, but his is so light
that you forget you are wearing it. Remember silk keeps you cool when it is hot out and warm when it is cold out. Better then wool.",B0000E014L
really warm  similar to underarmour without the price,B0000E014L
"My wife loves these.  She had some that were years old and starting wear out.  So I got her a new top and bottom for Christmas. This is a different brand than what she had before, so I just got the one.  She is 5'4"" and about 110. So I got smalls.  They seem snug but are supposed to be as the go under other clothes.  She tried them and loved them so we ordered two more sets, one in black. Her office is a little cold and she says these make her very comfortable. So a winner! It is thin, breathable and washes and dries quickly (by hand). She's looking forward to the other sets!
I ordered this on a Thursday and it came exactly a week later.",B0000E014L
"My wife works with children outside all winter long. This is light, but does a great job of keeping her warm without heavy thermals. Runs true to size.",B0000E014L
Warm and cozy but stretches out and gets ratty quickly.  Still love it.,B0000E014L
My niece had this and wanted another so I know she'd give it 5 stars!,B0000E014L
"When viewed simply as a warming layer of undergarment, the Thermasilk performs exactly as it should.  A very light, thin layer to add a few extra degrees on cold days and nights.
One thing I didn't know about this material, but quickly found out when my wife wore it for the first time, is that the material is a little bit sheer.
I'm not complaining, of course, but just to warn you, these won't work as a substitute for pajamas.  They definitely must be worn underneath.",B0000E014L
"Hubby and I both got a set of these Thermasilk Filament layers for a Dec trip to NYC - these were perfect! These are thin, like slightly thicker than women's pantyhose, but that means that these easily fit under jeans and long sleeve tops.  We both felt warm enough to endure late nights in the chilly wind (with coats and scarves obviously) but didn't feel too bulky or hot. Sizing was true for both of us - not skin tight like spandex but not baggy either. You can bend your limbs just fine. These are great baselayers for walking a winter city, but not thick enough for really braving the elements.",B0000E014L
"Pretty fabric and collar. After washing on hand wash in washing machine all seams are still intact. Lower hem is not bulky and cuffs on sleeve stay in place. It is lightweight yet gives warmth even at freezing temperatures - yes had shirt, sweater and down jacket but it gave that ease of wear with all these layers. It was breathable & not sticky as with other fibers on other thermal shirts I've had.",B0000E014L
This is amazing and kept me very warm during my 20 degree dog walk this morning.  Helped keep me my clothes dry from sweating also. Highly recommend this.,B0000E014L
"This is fantastic. I have tried many other thermal underwear tops and bottoms, but this breathes with you and doesn't get you overheated and also gives your body that warmth you want!!!!",B0000E014L
"It is very comfortable, and washes well (I hang it up to dry, so cannot speak to what it might do in the dryer).  But it does not provide as much warmth as I would have thought, since it is described as thermasilk.",B0000E014L
"This is a middle of the road product, so I'm giving it a middle of the road rating (3 stars). If you are in serious need of being kept warm, I'd suggest avoiding this Thermasilk product altogether. I'm one of those always cold types, and I hoped this would be a non-bulky option to keep me decently warm. Wrong.

Pros:
- Very light-weight.
- It's decently fashionable. I sometimes wear it under short-sleeve shirts, and it looks cute enough.

Cons:
- Isn't this supposed to keep you warm? I have never felt warm/cozy in this Thermasilk product.
- It snags constantly! Honestly, I'm disappointed about not being kept warm in this shirt, but the snagging is a bigger disappointment. It snags in a manner similar to pantyhose.
- Not a washer/dryer friendly product.",B0000E014L
"I had a couple of these great Terra-mar tops before. I was so happy to see that AMAZON carried a whole line of TERRA MAR winter warmth items. I have looked at other brands but they never measured up. Ladies these are so silky and warm,just order your normal American size off their chart and you will be satisfied. Tried and true....These are the best for winter layering warmth.....treat yourself !!!",B0000E014L
This was exactly what I was Looking for,B0000E014L
Nice neck line.  Material just so so.  A little small.,B0000E014L
This was a gift for my girlfriend. She said the fit was perfect and they kept her very warm.,B0000E014L
was alot thinner than what I thought. They are actually see-through. Not what I expected.,B0000E014L
"I bought two sets of long underwear for the season, these in oatmeal heather size medium, both top and bottom, and the
Cuddl Duds Women's Thermal Long Sleeve Top & bottoms. This is a pretty classic set of long Johns. Like them a lot. I wear them under waterproof Patagonia pants out rowing on Gloucester Harbor. I am warm, cozy, and dry in them. I've already washed and dried them and they didn't seam to shrink.

Folks' reviews complain of their being too thin and running. I am not experiencing that issue with these. They're supposed to be lightweight. And if yours ran, maybe you're running something scratchy along them. They shouldn't run.

These are very seathrough. So they've got a sexy appeal to them too. So if you're on a little winter holiday getaway with your sweetie, these are kind of sexy in an unexpected kind of way, but maybe only would be considered sexy to folks who love winter outdoor sports and winter indoor recreation by the fireside.",B0000E014L
"Just fit my 5'3"" frame, comfortable and warm.",B0000E014L
"Thin, and not very sparing with the amount of cloth to produce it.  Buy a larger size than you usually wear, or better yet, spent more and get a better product.",B0000E014L
"Soft and comfortable, but be aware this is very thin and transparent. It will need to be worn under other clothing. I have worn these 5-10 times and have NOT had any trouble with runs as other reviewers mention. It is short in the torso and sleeve length. I actually purchased this in two different colors to wear under more formal shirts for work (e.g. silk button down) and it works perfectly for that purpose. The shirt peeks out a small amount above the top button, but does not hang out the sleeves or below the bottom of shirts I want to wear untucked. It is not too hot to wear in a slightly chilly office and I am very pleased with it's function as other long underwear is too hot. However, I would not really consider this shirt beneficial for keeping you warm in the winter. It would work to layer under a T shirt for a slight bit of warmth on a cool spring / fall day, but not really long underwear for snow skiing type of thing unless you have trouble getting too hot.",B0000E014L
I let a freezing young friend of my daughter borrow it in Italy and he has not returned it!,B0000E014L
"Since I am always cold and had tried so many ""silk tops,"" I had my doubts that this would be any different.  WOW was I surprised!!  It is incredibly good, very comfortable, fits true to size and at last, I am not freezing cold all the time.  It washes beautifully and I highly recommend it",B0000E014L
"I am 5'4"", 115lb, small size fitted me perfectly. Lightweight, works as it supposed to.",B0000E014L
"it's very very very very thin.  see through both the front and back thin.  it doesnt look like the picture either.  much more lacy and open.  i supposed i should have researched what pointelle-knit is.  if it wasn't open weave like the what is pictured it would be better even it is thin.  i cannot tell that it adds any warmth, i've worn it a few times.",B0000E014L
Nice lightweight item and keeps you warm.,B0000E014L
"Good fabric, great for layering. Body length and arms are a bit short for me but I am tall and usually have this problem.",B0000E014L
Exactly as pictured . Soft and silky against the skin.,B0000E014L
Warm and light. There is nothing like silk.,B0000E014L
"I love the pants, but why are the shirts so short?  I will give them 4 stars, because they are the perfect weight and provide a lot of warmth for the bulk, but they basically reach about 1/2 an inch below the top of my jeans, so they can't be tucked in, and they ride up.  I would love these if they were a lot longer like old school thermal shirts.",B0000E014L
silk very thin. inadequate for temps below 32 degrees. don't buy these.,B0000E014L
"Fits great, good thermal layer.  Love the very thin aspect of it.",B0000E014L
This light weight top is the perfect companion to wear under other shirts when layering.  It works remarkably well.,B0000E014L
"I bought the set (pants and tee) to wear in Ireland and England.  Found myself warm and toasty every day.  I washed them each night and hung them in the hotel bathrooms.  Next morning they were ready to wear again.  I'd recommend you get two sets so you don't have damp cuffs.  They fit perfectly under clothes... no bunching!
HIGHLY recommend and would never again think of going anywhere chilly without them.",B0000E014L
Very pleased.  Nice and warm !!!,B0000E014L
perfect except the arms are a little long,B0000E014L
"Cozy, lightweight underwear in cold temps. Subtle design. Very nice and price $27. is right!",B0000E014L
"Very light weight and comfortable. I've worn it as underwear and also a a top with overskirt, so I like the versatility, especially when traveling. It washes and dries well.",B0000E014L
"Very comfortable, both for sleepware or under clothing to layer on chilly days.",B0000E014L
Size was a problem.  Too small.,B0000E014L
"Comfortable, great warmth even in very cold conditions.",B0000E014L
Wonderfully warm and comfortable.  Not bulky under outer clothing.,B0000E014L
It's beutiful but I don't know yet if its too warm,B0000E014L
"These are great for adding a little extra warmth without adding bulk, thus allowing me to wear that extra layer without substantially changing the fit of whatever I wear over it. I have found them useful for fall weather and mild winters. I haven't tested them beyond that.

As one would expect from silk, the material is soft. If you pack light, and wash clothes in the sink, you can expect these to hang dry in a reasonable period of time. They do pick up a little static sometimes.",B0000E014L
"Bought 2 of these, one for my daughter who was going skiing and one for my mother who is always cold. It is thin enough to wear under your clothes at all times yet warm enough to do the trick.",B0000E014L
look very cheap on wear and with first wash lost its texture and became loose and shrank looks better on the internet.,B0000E014L
"Arrived on time--before I left on trip to northern Scotland--and were very helpful in keeping me warm. Were somewhat large, but I was glad to have!",B0000E014L
I like this a lot. Wears and washes well. If only they offered a short sleeve version in black silk.,B0000E014L
I wish the neckline was a little deeper & the sleeves are too long Otherwise I love it Looks & feels great,B0000E014L
I expect my wife to be cozy in her silk underwear while we tour Alaska this coming month of May,B0000E014L
"Compared to other silk sleepwear it have purchased, this one was very thin. So it is acceptable, but not as nice as I had expected.",B0000E014L
True to size & very warm for the cold winter months. I would recommend this thermasilk to anyone who wants to stay warm,B0000E014L
I bought this partly because the reviews said it was very thin.  And it is.  I wanted to wear it under cotton shirts as another layer of warmth.  For that it was perfect.  It had the added bonus of not taking up much room or adding much weight to my suitcase.  I wish it came in a turtle neck model.,B0000E014L
"Light, comfy, fit well and kept me warm.  Recommend to anyone.  Have used them ofter and really enjoyed wearing them.",B0000E014L
The shirt arrived with a torn sleeve and is so short I can barely tuck it in. Quality not good. Took too long to open it so I couldn't return it.  Will never buy again and wouldn't recommend anyone buying it.,B0000E014L
"Very thin - which is exactly what I wanted - something that I could wear under dressy clothes. I like that it is long, so I can tuck it in easily.",B0000E014L
this shirt works just like a silk undershirt but is a lot less costly.  i love it. got black too,B0000E014L
"So soft, so warm. Good quality. I'm 5'8"" and long waisted, it is just long enough but if I had a choice I prefer that it be about 2 inches longer.",B0000E014L
Seller was excellent.  This is a great product.  Got one for long winter trip to Austria and it was perfect.  Not too heavy and perfect warmth and protection.  Bought two more for winter wear around the house.,B0000E014L
"We consider 65 degrees F cold here in Hawaii.  When I got the item, I immediately tried it on under my knit blouse....after 1/2 hour I did not feel any warmth from the top.  Maybe I have to be in colder weather????  I had to put a jacket on even with the thermasilk undershirt on.",B0000E014L
Chose this over winter silks but this is very thin and for the $$$ not a great deal.  Would not purchase another.,B0000E014L
This seems well-made and adds no bulk under my clothing. Excellent for chilly offices where the air conditioning comes on at odd times of the day.,B0000E014L
"I was was looking for a light weight layer to help me get thru these colder than normal NYC days and this works ok. I would give it another star if it washed well. A word of advice, use the delicate cycle.",B0000E014L
this item is very comfortable and by far it keeps you warm with out the bulkiness. it is great for layering. I have purchased 4 of them,B0000E014L
"It's more silk than thermal. Unfortunately I received it while I was on the road and missed the window to return it. It's 100% see through, which the picture doesn't really show. The material isn't soft or nice against the skin. All around flop :(",B0000E014L
"It is not as warm as I read from the review, still have to wear 3 more layers of clothing to beat the Chicago weather.",B0000E014L
"This shirt was much lighter in weight than I expected but it was warm as an undergarment/layer. Note, it is very sheer so you definitely need to wear it under something.",B0000E014L
The quality doesn't look great. It's very thin and it looks like it will disintegrate if I'm any rougher with it. The sleeves were too long and the neckline as sagging. Doesn't keep me that warm either. A cotton shirt might have been able to do the same job.,B0000E014L
"Ii was very surprised that something so thin would actually keep the chills away.  I am always cold at work and this Thermasilk was perfect.  I must say, I was hesitant at first, but first of all, when I put it on, I was so happy the neck had enough scoop that it didn't show above my scrub top.  It is so soft, you can't tell you have it on, until go to take it off and remember ""I wasn't even cold today.""  Maybe not enough for snowmobiling without added thermals, but it was the perfect thing I was looking for under my scrubs and other clothes. Be careful and treat it like a delicate.  I wash it in my mesh bag.  That's how great it is.",B0000E014L
It's truly amazing how warm these thermals keep you considering how thin they are.  I wore these backpacking and they did a great job at insulating without overwarming.,B0000E014L
"I like the material even though it's a little staticky. It helps keep me warmer but I thought it would be even more warm than what it does, maybe it's just my body temperature.",B0000E014L
I really love these long johns. My boss insists on keeping the office freezing so I wear these under my clothes. They are so thin clothes glide over them and yet they really keep me warm. They have washed beautifully I put them in a lingerie bay so they don't get snagged.,B0000E014L
"Just the right weight to wear under a sweater but cannot be worn alone!
Must wash inside a lingerie bag since the fabric is delicate.",B0000E014L
"I had bought a Thermasilk years ago. This one seems thinner and shorter, i. e. of lesser quality.  That being said, the product rates 4 stars because it is silk and a very good insulator.",B0000E014L
"True to size, sleeves would be better without cuffs.  The cuffs sometimes show out of my sweaters.  Otherwise, like this is a great thermasilk product.  It should come in three-quarter sleeves and it would be perfect!",B0000E014L
Very thin. Useless. Seriously. Do not waste your money. Maybe it's not meant to be for warmth. It is smooth.,B0000E014L
Sizes are accurate and I love silk underwear for the cold. It's not heavy but definitely helps keep you warm. I used to purchase them from a ski shop but they were much more expensive.,B0000E014L
"The value of the product was good, however, the quality is not. I enjoy wearing silk underwear in the Winter, but this is disappointing.",B0000E014L
"I am happy with this as an underlayer-- thinner than I had thought it would be. As a lightweight underlayer it is great though, and will extend into the spring and fall, hopefully it will hold up!",B0000E014L
This set of silk thermals is the base of most of my wardrobe. I have a skin disorder that causes sores and the silk is not irritating at all. They are true to size and a must for layering. I can even wear them under tights ( ain't easy :),B0000E014L
This silky does the job and keeps me warm. I prefer my silk underwear thin but some may not like the fact that it is see through,B0000E014L
Keeps you warm indoors and outside but not suffocating.  Light weight this mesh easy to wear under multiple top layers if desired.,B0000E014L
I found the fabric on both the top and bottom quiet a bit thinner than the last pair I bought. So dissapointing that the quality from China is getting worse all the time.,B0000E014L
"Surpassed expectations! Warm and lightweight under scrubs. Easy care, quick drying!  Would recommend to anyone working with exposure to the cold.",B0000E014L
"Would not recommend buying these.  Totally sheer and not warm...even in my heated home.  Bought two, so maybe if I wear both at same time they will have some warmth?!  Buyer's regret.",B0000E014L
"This was a very pricey item that was a poor fit.  While it was warm, the arms were too long and the material did not hold its shape once it was put on.  It just kept stretching.",B0000E014L
"I love this thermasilk top!  Feels comfortable and keeps me warm without feeling ""bundled up"".  I would highly recommend this product!",B0000E014L
These are very lightweight. I wear them under my work clothes without the feeling of bulkiness. I bought a black one and a white one and now plan to get the tank tops. The shirts do not quite scoop enough to go unnoticed under work clothes but they look nice enough to look like they are part of the outfit.,B0000E014L
"Since the Polar Vortex is hounding us, this is the best investment I ever made.  Should have purchased more than one.  I wear it everyday in these minus degree days we are having in the mid-west.  Washes up nicely, too.  Right size and all.",B0000E014L
A little thinner than ones purchased for $20 more - but seem well made for the price - have not worn as yet - but will change rating if it does not wear or last well.,B0000E014L
I bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it. She is going to take it along to the Andes Mountains with us in February.,B0000E014L
"Love all three of these. Warm but like wearing nothing at all. There's no bulk like with most thermalwear, and no binding, just silky nothingness.",B0000E014L
"I headed to MI from AZ during the ""polar vortex"" and decided these would be a good idea. Very comfortable, very warm, without the bulk of traditional long johns. I wear a medium and these were just a little loose, meaning they were not form fitted but were perfectly fine under jeans.",B0000E014L
"My Aunt loved it!  It keeps her comfortable and warm, she is really enjoying this item, I'll buy more when I need to.",B0000E014L
"I absolutely love this product.  I have several, and I've worn them for the past few years, under just about everything, from December through March.  The great advantage to this silk is that they aren't thick or bulky, so they don't make clothes feel tighter.",B0000E014L
"I purchased this as a gift for my grandmother, who has circulatory problems.  The lightweight silk fits comfortably under her clothes but provides the warmth she needs without bulk.",B0000E014L
I ordered this because it was a lot cheaper than the LL Bean ones I had been ordering. It seemed to be about the same quality only the sizing is much smaller. It was also too short to tuck in which I like in a first layer shirt. Other than that these shirts are great. You can wear them under a sweater of knit shirt and they don't cling to the top layer. So loose fitting clothes over them don't creep up. It's unfortunate that they cheeped out and made them 4 inches too short.,B0000E014L
"I was sort of disappointed when I received this because I expected it to be fitted and it is too loose to comfortably where under fitted sweaters. It also snags easily so be careful with rings, etc. However, the feel of the fabric is wonderful, and I am still able to wear it under certain things.",B0000E014L
"I got this for my wife and she really likes it.  She says it keeps her warm and fits well.  Also, it's well constructed and sturdy.

Also, the fabric has a nicer feel than polyester.

The only sort of down side is that it is not as warm as (the much more expensive) merino wool thermals.",B0000E014L
"The material is able to trap body heat, and when worn under a sweater and jacket, it is warm indeed! It is extremely comfortable, doesn't feel like you are wearing a thermal underwear at all. Highly recommended!",B0000E014L
"This shirt is just great for the cold weather, it is thin enought to wear under shirts or sweathers without feeling tight. I like the shirt because it is airey and light.  I have only wore the shirt 3 times  and I am glad that I ordered it. I have had shirts before that you wear for extra protection from the cold and not one is as great as this one and it is also pretty. The shirt is a lot nicer then I thought it would be..",B0000E014L
Fit nicely under every day clothes although sleeves were slightly long. Silk keeps from sweating when going inside after walk,B0000E014L
"Knit silk is an excellent fabric for insulation.  It doesn't seem like such a thin fabric could be so effective, but it is.  I like the pointelle; it makes the fabric more feminine.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product again.",B0000E014L
"The recipient,  you understand,  is often against my continual desire to bathe her in gifts, but this one she greeted it with a smile and instantly put it on.
That's a sign, Best became Better!",B0000E014L
"really glad i could find silk undies for less then $45 a piece.  took one star off for sizing, but i always seem to have sizing issues.  xs fits more like a small.",B0000E014L
"I love these undergarments!  The color is lighter than shown but, it is still a lovely pink.  They are thin and so comfortable.  I've only tried them in mildly cold days (30 F).  Because of how thin they are, I'm afraid to try them in anything colder.  They are so thin and comfortable, that you forget they are even there. I'm 5' 3"" and about 135lbs. and the small fit great!

Cons:  Snag easily",B0000E014L
This shirt ripped the first time I wore it.  I have two and both have pilled and snagged more than once.  Very dissappointed for the price I paid and will not purchase another.,B0000E014L
I bought this item along with the pants to wear to A Pittsburgh Steelers game in Dec in the snow. I am from So. Calif. this was my first experience in cold snowy weather. These thermal underwear worked great in keeping me warm not to mention they are so thin and light weight and comfortable.,B0000E014L
This is very light weight and easy to fit under other clothing. It is also easy to wash and dry quickly. I like it a lot!,B0000E014L
"I bought this to provide another layer while playing winter golf.  It is so light, you hardly know you are wearing it and it adds no bulk so you don't look fat.  There is zero restriction of movement and the silk absorbs perspiration better than any synthetic dri-tech fabric.",B0000E014L
This was way way too big and very thin.  I can't use it because of its size.  I also bought the leggings and they were too big but I wore them and they sagged on my legs. Also very thin to help keep warm with an added layer of clothing.,B0000E014L
warm and soft for the winter.  fits under clothes nicely with no bulk.  buy it for my mother who just loves it for the chicago winters!,B0000E014L
"These exceeded my expectations.  Well made but most of all, helped keep me warm. Washed beautifully and dried quickly.  The sizes run large, I ordered extra small for the top which was more than adequate but I ordered small for the bottom which was too big but I was able to manage.
The Pointelle Scoop was very attractive.",B0000E014L
"My wife will probably be after me when she reads this but although she is rather petite she's also uh, full figured and this garment fit her very well for the cold weather here in the northeast. Amazing how much this thing can stretch!",B0000E014L
"I like this thermal top - it's really thin and light, but warm and feels nice against my skin.  It has a delicate pattern knitted into the fabric, subtle, but gives it a little 'fancy' up close.  The shirt makes a nice under layer, warm without being bulky, and pretty enough that it's okay if the arms stick out under a t-shirt.

The quality seems good, no manufacturing defects that I could see, with nice straight seams and no loose threads.  I'm not sure yet how it will hold up to multiple washings because it's still pretty new.

The fit is as basically expected.  I ordered my usual size and it's a close fit without being tight or confining.  My one complaint is that it's a little short; when I tuck it into jeans, it immediately un-tucks itself the first time I bend or sit.  Another 2 or 3 inches at the bottom would've made it a 5 star shirt.",B0000E014L
"Very silky, fits well and is attractive.  The knit is light but strong and I will enjoy wearing it.  I am 5'9"" and the large fits well with plenty of length in the body and sleeves. I usually wear a medium but I didn't wnt to have to struggle into the pants and shirt so I bought larger and they are close fitting without being tight. I like the extra length on my long arms.",B0000E014L
I bought these Terramar Thermasilk undies for my niece to wear under her clothes while showing her cattle at a stock show.  She said they were warm and felt wonderful.  Great price and great product!,B0000E014L
I love this under everything. It is so soft and comfortable under my sweaters and I wear it with my scrubs for extra warmth. I need to get some more of these.,B0000E014L
"The fabric is see through and light. Very good for an under layer. It is warm and soft. I was hoping the fabric was a bit thicker because of the picture. The colour is a lighter shade than shown. Very nice colour, a warm pinkish berry.  Washed nicely in the wash machine and dryer. The sizing was smaller than expected but it fit.",B0000E014L
"I bought a large, and it is short but sleeves are long enough. Material is thin, but soft and does not irritate my admittedly over-sensitive skin. I agree (from N. Oregon) with ""Montana"" it is for layering, this is first layer.  I put a sweatshirt over it and an Irish or British wool sweater over that (thick wool). Then going outside, still I would need a hat and an overcoat, wool socks, waterproof shoes. The pants are sold separately, I will try those next.

I would not put it in a dryer, either, cold water and hang up on a wood hanger or lay out in front of a pellet stove or fireplace on a towel to dry.  It might bleed, I would not wash it with white or light colours, cold water. So that part is maybe a bit of a hassle. OTOH, the price and convenience for getting 2 of them in the mailbox when I really hate the retail clothing experience, is priceless. If you want something more luxurious, pay more. If you are going to pay more try Ag textile, which is almost like silk and insulates quite well and also lasts until the silver wears off, 3 years or so.",B0000E014L
The material really is so light that it doesn't feel like you're wearing it. It did bunch up a few times when I layered it over with a sweater or long-sleeved fitted tee.,B0000E014L
Excellent fit and good for layering.  I am very happy with the product.  I will purchase again as the occasion arises.,B0000E014L
"Not heavy, but held in the hear.  Good for travel as it was easy to wash by hand, dried  fast and packed in a small space",B0000E014L
"Love this top.  I bought it for a trip to Norway in a few months, but I might wear it out before then, I like it so much.

It got super nippy cold here, in So Cal, and I thought I'd better see how my first-ever silk underwear top felt.  Now I want to wear it every day. Love the color, too.  I got ""Jazzberry."" Luscious.  Oh, and WARM.",B0000E014L
"Would recommend these to anyone, price was reasonable compared to other manufactures and they keep me warm, which is why I bought them.",B0000E014L
"The reason I ordered this is because I had bought one in a Houston store and could not find it again. I would like to order another one in a neutral color and and another black. They are very comfortable. Please send me the link.
If you order one know that black fades so wash separately. It will dry quickly if hung.",B0000E014L
"I had one of these previously and love it!  I literally wore the old one out!  It is perfect; lightweight, snug fitting to wear under clothing and folds up to a tiny size to go anywhere.  I will probably buy a second one as the price was very good.  When I purchased in a store I paid much more!",B0000E014L
Neckline is too prominent under shirts.  Got dyed when I washed with other laundry.  Does not have a silky feel to it.,B0000E014L
"It fitted perfectly; it  washed easily, and dried quickly.  Furthermore, it kept me warm in 30 degree weather in Prague.",B0000E014L
"I was looking for a thermal shirt that was thin and warm and this does it!  Keep in mind, it's VERY thin...not exactly the best on it's own for a PJ top (especially if you get it in white, like I did) unless you're very comfortable around anyone who might be seeing you.  My only complaints is that the neck is high enough that you can see the trim over basically any non-turtleneck sweater, and sometimes the cuffs too (but these can easily be rolled up).",B0000E014L
Form fitting... I love silk and other natural fibers and love how clothing slips right over this silky material.  Lightweight but certainly warmer than polyester or cotton base layers.,B0000E014L
"Thin but providing warmth. Fit under a variety of clothing for layering. I love that they are 100% silk, because many of the man-made fibers make me smell! Natural fibers do not. I have five of these - two black and three natural. LOVE THEM!",B0000E014L
"This is delicate top, although I did wash it on the delicate cycle in the washer, and it was fine.  It did keep me quite warm in 40 degree damp weather with just a sweater and scarf.  Am looking forward to actually being warm this winter.  Very effective top.",B0000E014L
"I was hoping to love this top but I don't so much because although the overall fit is good, the length has shrunk so much that I cannot tuck it in my pants.  It also doesn't really add a layer of warmth.  I bought this to wear under my scrubs and I am still freezing!",B0000E014L
My elderly mother loves it. We live in a cold country so she needs this to get through the winter.,B0000E014L
This therma underlined is way too thin. Wore it to work under my coverall and was freezing all day. Wind passed straight through it. Waste of money. I put them in the donation bag.,B0000E014L
"I bought them to use as layering, and a way to pack lightly. This they do admirably. They roll down to almost nothing, and three shirts fit in the extra pace in a packing cube I already use. They take up no additional space in my system.
That alone makes them worth my investment.

Once you grasp that this is underwear, not a T-shirt, this becomes a very nice layer.
I chose it because merino base layers were out of my budget.
These came in a pack of three. They have a strong chemical smell, so whisk them to a sink of sudsy water.
They dry quickly, a major selling point for me,
Shirts are VERY sheer. As in lingerie sheer. Which also means they are lightweight. Very lightweight.
They seem a touch fragile, but likely only sections of sleeve would show, if at all.
Natural fiber base layer for less than $60? And three of them?
This is a budget traveller (to cool and cold climes) dream come true.
Silk. Neither the highest quality silk, nor the lowest. Not slick like the silk shirts from the '80s. Slight diamond pattern.

Again, not suitable as a top layer, like some merino wool can be, but admirably suited to the task.
Balancing price and limitations, this come out a winner.",B0000E014L
"Fit perfect, kept me warm, but not too warm, hand washed easily, dried quickly.  Excellent purchase. Would recommend for any cold climate travelers!",B0000E014L
I bought this shirt and the pants for a July trip to New Zealand.  They are very lightweight but add lots of warmth.  Good purchase.,B0000E014L
I bought this Thermasilk for backcountry camping.  It is really nice on the skin and dries super fast.  The only problem is that the velcro on my sleeping bag caused it to snag.,B0000E014L
The fit is perfect and it is very lightweight. The rounded neck also is low enough so it doesnt show under shirts.great buy!,B0000E014L
"I tend to be cold. I wore this frequently last winter and it gave me some cozy warmth without being bulky.
I put it in the regular cold wash in a net bag and hung it up carefully to dry.",B0000E014L
"This shirt is true to size and a good fit. The problem is that when I washed it ( by hand), the color washed out too. My shirt started out bright purple and after one wash looks like it was washed 20 times. Other than that, I liked it veey much. It's thin and warm. Great for packing  on vacation.or in a carry on bag or for taking backpacking. It takes up no space.",B0000E014L
"Got it as a Christmas present for her. It's very thin and lightweight, but somehow keeps her very warm on even the coldest days. I don't know how it works, but she had one a long time ago and wore it to tatters so I went looking and I saw them at Dick's Sporting Goods for $70, which was too pricey, so I looked here and found it. She loves it and is getting more.",B0000E014L
"I liked very much. The material was as I expected: soft, thin and very warm. No volume under my  other clothes.
Good for dressing under silk like  shirts and dresses,with long sleeves, in mild temperature (12-15oC) and  whithout jackets or long coats. They are very confortable.

The other second skin sold here are thicker and unconfortable because of the volume.
The arms were too long for me, but I am not a tall women. I think the size  would fit well a number 12-14, and a tall women.",B0000E014L
"Like the pant, this top was absolutely perfect!  Light and warm!  Perfect!  Wore it everywhere when visiting the Bay Area!",B0000E014L
"Very familiar with the brand from local store. Wanted more, so took a short cut and ordered more from Amazon - I like to do this for really great value. Unfortunately, they did not have the exact style I wanted and took a chance on this one - no at all what I want or need. I don't ever have time to exchange items, so will keep it and see if there will be some other use for it. No complaints with the company - I just took a chance and it did not work out.",B0000E014L
"Very thin and sheer fabric, but expected that from the description and reviews. Fits comfortably but I'm not sure how warm it really keeps me. I wear at least 3 layers because I work in construction sites with no heat during the winter and I'm still cold, but I'm always cold ;).  Comfortable and easy to move in.",B0000E014L
I didn't like the material.  It felt cheap. It was too thin and not soft enough.  It also wasn't long enough.,B0000E014L
"So thin, great for keeping you warm without all the bulk. Would definitely buy these again.,also easy to wash. The black color is nice.",B0000E014L
I like to wear these when mowing or working in garden during full sun days vs slathering on the pore blocking sun screen.  If you think about what you spend on sun screen vs light weight clothing - clothing by far comes out ahead since I just sweat the sun screen off..I usaully get 3-4 seasons with tops and 1-3 seasons with bottoms.,B0000E014L
"THis is light and warm, as advertised. However, be aware that the scoop neck isn't that low or wide, so you can't wear it with a shirt that's more scoopy.",B0000E014L
This is soft and light and punctions as good light weight base layer. Seems a little delicate so I'm hand washing. Time will tell on durability.,B0000E014L
"I have worn these for years to keep out the cold and feel warm with just one extra not noticed layer.
They are delightfully warm with no weight.",B0000E014L
I layer this under a merino wool undershirt and the two layers work well to keep in the warmth.  The Termasilk top washes well and has not run yet.  I wear it almost every day.,B0000E014L
"When i received this shirt in the mail I was shocked that it was not opaque. The picture for the item does not seem translucent at all, but the shirt is completely see through. I had to reconfigure all my layering that I had planned for my ski trip because this item can not be worn on its own.",B0000E014L
"I think this is a very good purchase; however it is more sheer than I expected.  It also runs small.  I still wear it and it does stretch.  Silk is the best material ever.  It keeps me warm, but I do not feel like I'm wearing anything underneath my clothes.",B0000E014L
"Silk underwear is crucial for those of us who live in cold climates, and although this isn't the nicest silk top I've owned, it's perfectly functional and significantly less expensive than the better ones. The fabric isn't as nice as some others I've owned (REI's was the best) but having high-quality fabric isn't as important for a top than as for a pant. The main point is that in buying this one, I saved almost $20 and got a top that will work just fine.

I may feel less happy if the fabric runs or develops holes quickly, but that's just less likely than with a pant. I do think that the quality is significantly worse than with the best of these products, so if you wear yours every day, spring for the more expensive, higher-quality product.

As for sizing, I ordered a bit large and found that it fits perfectly well, even after laundering.

I wasn't sure whether I'd be happy with the scoop neck, but that has allowed me to wear it under more of my clothes.",B0000E014L
"I give it a 5 star rating as I took this on an Arctic vacation and used it as a base layer, and also slept in it. It is so soft and light and not at all scratchy. I became allergic to wool so this is a good alternative.",B0000E014L
Very Very thin. static is huge problem.  doesn't really provide any warmth. I was expecting something comparable to what I already owned. Probably won't get used much.,B0000E014L
"Great product!  Very warm under-layer, especially for skiing and outdoor activities!  Soft, comfortable, yet sheer to fit under clothes.  I bought the Terramar Thermasilk leggings too!",B0000E014L
Excellent undergarment for the ski slopes.  I wear this under my ski jacket for 25 degree days and up and put on an additional layer when it is a bit colder.  The pants are great too.,B0000E014L
This product is thin enough to be worn under anything and makes a giant difference is how warm you will be! Iove all my Thermasilke stuff!,B0000E014L
"I bought it mainly to wear this while playing golf in frigid weather.  I liked it enough to buy two more.  Its texture is not as soft, air-tight, and warm as that of Uniqlo's thermal undershirt but, given that Uniqlo does not sell its products online in the U.S., this was a good second choice.",B0000E014L
It's fine as another layer and is comfy but doesn't do much for keeping me warm.  Would not purchase again.,B0000E014L
This top is wonderful.  I layer it under sweaters to stop the itchys from wool; I layer it during cold weather to keep very comfortable.  I also use it to sleep in.  It is very light and travels well.,B0000E014L
"This was almost exactly what I wanted.  I had ordered the medium before and had to return it.  Much too large.  I am 5'3', weighing 120lbs.  The arm length is much too long so the cuff becomes easily soiled.  I decided I would cut it off and hem it at the proper length.  More to do but basically it provides a lot of warmth for such a think fabric.",B0000E014L
"If you want something to keep you warm that's not going to show bulk under your tightest sweater, this is what you want.  In fact it's so sheer, I can't even find mine.  I think it's hiding somewhere in the inner reaches of my washing machine or maybe clinging to one of my bed sheets.  Other than that, it's fine;  easy to wash and it dries (not in the dryer) in a very short time.  Now if I could just find it....",B0000E014L
"Despite that the label says this can be tumble dried on low heat, mine shrank a lot when I did that. If you plan to use a dryer, I suggest buying one size larger. Before it shrank I really liked it. The little bit of extra warmth it provides without being bulky is great, and it's nice to be able to pull a sweater or t-shirt over it without the sleeves pushing up to my elbows.",B0000E014L
It's thin but warm. Also great for travel--drying time was quick. It was also quite soft and comfortable. Recommend it.,B0000E014L
"I was delighted when it first arrived:  very silky, lightweight, long in the waist for tucking in, and a bit of a dip at the neck so it doesn't show above sweaters.  However, after washing it on delicate in lukewarm water and laying it out flat on a towel to dry, I was surprised to see how much it had shrunk in length...3 inches!  Luckily it still fits into my slacks, but not by much.  And the delicate pattern in the silk has condensed a bit, so it is not as silky as it was before.  Also, wearing it under a cashmere sweater does not protect me from feeling the slight itchiness of the wool on my skin.  Not sure if I would buy again, although I did feel warmer with it on, and the arm length is perfect.  I am a size 8 and I bought a small after having read the other reviews.",B0000E014L
I ordered a large which should be just a little big for me - it was skin tight and shrunk even more when washed.,B0000E014L
"The shirt is not ultra-heavy nor ultra-light. This dry-fit material is very nice for the gym, running outside or skiing. Size accurately. Great color! So I bought another one.",B0000E014L
This is the second time I have ordered Thermasilks and it feels like your second skin. It keeps me warm under sweaters without having to add more layers. I recommend this product 100%.,B0000E014L
"This is a thin lightweight product that is very comfortable.  It provides extra warmth, but also allows your skin to breathe so you don't get as hot.  If you have sweaters that are a little uncomfortable or bulky, it's great to wear underneath as a barrier.",B0000E014L
This is a really pretty and very lightweight layer to wear under sweaters or long sleeve shirts. I would highly recommend it. Fits snugly.,B0000E014L
"The Terramar Women's Thermasilk Pointelle Scoop top was thin and silky but kept me comfortably warm this winter.  That said, the weather was only about 3C to 9C.  It wrinkled easily after wash but it dried quickly.  Unlike other reviews I have read, mine retained it's shape.  I am a size 6 or small (American size), heavy on top and the small fits well.",B0000E014L
It does not feel like I am wearing anything. It is very warm and comfortable under any sweater or shirt.,B0000E014L
"It is wonderful that they make thermal underwear in such soft silk, light weight and able to do the job.  Great to have for the winter.",B0000E014L
I found these to be accurately sized and comfortable to wear.  For the $27 price they appear be compatible in quality to others costing upwards to $40.,B0000E014L
"It was really thin, like really thin. Works decently as a under layer. Just once issue: The collar is laced, which I could not tell from the picture.",B0000E014L
I bought this as a base layer and am well pleased with the fit and comfort of this top.  It washed easily and comes out of the dryer ready to wear.  Gets more comfortable with each laundering.  Good top for the money.  I will buy again.,B0000E014L
"This shirt fits extremely well, and it isn't too hot or not hot enough.  I hope others will purchase one to see how great they are.",B0000E014L
"I have the same brand, same style, same size that I bought a year ago and this is MUCH bigger!!!",B0000E014L
"I love this undershirt. I bought one (along with the leggins) last winter to wear under my XC ski clothing. Next I took it on a 5wk walk across Spain this spring. Although I didn't need to wear it much on the walk I lent it to several of my friends who were walking with me and who needed a little extra warmth! My sister was one and I promised her one for her birthday! I found it quite roomy and could have probably bought a medium for myself....hence I bought the medium for my sister. It can be squished into a ziplock bag taking no space in your pack. It is warm and washes and dries quickly overnight. All in all a very useful item for travelling!
Jenn, BC",B0000E014L
"I wore this around Ireland on a recent trip. Was perfect under all of the layers and was warm. My only ""con"" is that it snags easily. But other than that I would recommend this product.",B0000E014L
Purchased this product for my wife as a base layer during winter. It fits her well and keeps her warm . Great product for the money .,B0000E014L
"I use this product as a base layer and like to pile other layers on top. This shirt allows my skin to breathe which makes it in my opinion much better than the synthetic base layers.
Silk is a very good insulating fabric very lightweight and great to wear under many layers.

One thing I have noticed about the top and especially the pants that can be brought separately is that I feel it does not run true to size.
I suggest buying one size smaller than the sizing chart implies.",B0000E014L
"I had bought a similar thermal long sleeve shirt about 15 years ago at Macy's and I wore it until it began to rip from wear. I could not find anything similar to it at any of the local department stores. The Terramar Thermasilk Top is almost exact to the one I had purchased all those years ago at Macy's except the cuffs are a little different, and the price is a lot cheaper through Amazon. It's light enough to wear under blouses and I sometimes wear it under short sleeve tops (I don't like showing my upper arms). I work in an office where the air conditioner is always on, so I've been wearing this top a lot. I'll probably buy another as a back up.",B0000E014L
"Bought one for myself and another one for my daughter we both love it. This shirt is so soft and thin and feels very pleasant to wear, while keeping me warm and cozy. definitely a favorite this winter! I was so pleased that I bought several more products by the same manufacturer and will again.",B0000E014L
"My silk long johns were long overdue for replacement. This is it. Not so thin it's cheap, but you just know you're going to be warm and not be bulked up in your mother's long johns. In other words, you'll be warm in your tight jeans and who'll know there are long johns underneath? These are (almost) sexy! And roomy. I'm tall and chesty so it's difficult to find things like this that fit. These do and I know I'm gonna love them. Going to an 8-day photo class in Santa Fe where the weather in one day can go from freezing to hot hot hot. But I'll start out with these, duck behind a bush and get them off (if I can find a bush) and if we stay for sunset, get them back out for the cold evenings in Santa Fe.",B0000E014L
"Title says it all.  Very light weight, you don't even feel like you are wearing thermal underwear but efficient, very warm, easy to launder and dry.  Will probably buy some more for next winter.",B0000E014L
"I took my first trip to Europe in the middle of december and it was quite cold.
The Terramar top and bottoms were light, easy to pack, even easier to wear and kept me very warm.
A worthwile investment that I will be able to use again and again.",B0000E014L
"This is so incredibly thin I figured it would not keep me warm AT ALL, but it at least does an ok job at that. I would not say that it makes me nice and toasty on a cold day out skiing, but keeps me from being completely chilled to the bones. However, unlike every other ""long underwear"" I have ever had for skiing, this is not long in length at all. In fact, I can only wear it with ski pants as they come up higher than normal pants. Jeans don't even reach the bottom of this top, just leaving it hanging open on my midriff which is a very poor design. I don't see anyone else mentioning this so maybe I just got a top form a bad lot, but I thought it worth mentioning. The top is good for one of many layers, but I can't really count on it as a sole under layer to a sweater and coat as it just doesn't do THAT great a job at keeping you warm if you are out in the snow. If it is just mildy chilly and you are wearing them to add just a thin (and I do mean thin) layer for extra warmth then these are for you",B0000E014L
"I bought the x-small but it was still too roomy for my taste. I'm usually a size 0-2. If I'm going to have a layer this thin, I want it to fit like pantyhose. It also has a pattern on it, kinda like snowflakes, but I wanted something plain.",B0000E014L
"I wanted a lightweight but warm layer to wear underneath my clothing at my (very cold) office. Silk is a wonderful thermal layer -- very light, comfortable on my skin and incredibly warm for its weight. The sizing I'd say is true-to-size, and the quality is excellent. My only complaint is that I wish the ""scoop neck"" on this shirt was just a little lower because I can see the edges peaking out from under my open-necked shirts. The neck opening is much lower than a crewneck-style shirt, though, so for most people I imagine it would be perfect.",B0000E014L
"I purchased this underlayer for an outdoor trip during cold weather and it is a very comfortable undergarment that will not take up so much room under your clothing that the fit is made tight. That is exactly what I wanted. It is warm but breathable. I like the feel of it, though I could see as other writers have said that it would need to be washed by hand as the fabric is  very delicate,sort of like a pair of pantyhose, but a little thicker. This top makes a perfect travel piece and would make a perfect lightweight pajama. I think it would be useful in both hot and cold weather. When I washed it by hand it was always perfectly dry by the morning. I like it so much I may purchase another!",B0000E014L
VERY COMFORTABLE AND FEELS GOOD AGAINST YOUR SKIN.  DON T THINK THEY WOULD INSULATE MUCH IN FRIGID TEMPS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY THIN  UNLESS DOING SOMETHING ACTIVE LIKE SKIING.,B0000E014L
"This item is soft and thin, but very warm and wearable under  most clothes. The material is similar to tights so you have to be careful not to snag the material.",B0000E014L
"I bought a set of these (top and bottom) for my wife as a Christmas gift. After I bought them and before she received them, I probed her for Christmas ideas. I was dismayed when she said she wouldn't want any ""long underwear"" as they are bulky and would make her look bigger. Great! I reluctantly gave them as a gift anyway. I am glad I did. She loves them! They are quite thin and are just enough to take the chill off in the winter. More often than not she sleeps in them, as they don't twist and bunch up like most sleepwear.

They are very shear. As in see through. Not necessarily a bad thing but something one needs to know.",B0000E014L
"this is a fine top and helps keep you warm in very cold weather...it is pink....one thing to suggest, wash it first before wearing, could cause rash....",B0000E014L
"The shirt is so thin, that I doubt it will have the ability to keep me warm.  This is only speculation, since I have not worn it in cold weather as yet.",B0000E014L
"The shirt is so thin that I certainly can't wear it without something over it, but the extra warmth is just the right amount.",B0000E014L
"Fantastic - light enough to go under a shirt, and feels like you're wearing a sweatshirt!  Pants and socks are the same way.",B0000E014L
"Knew this brand from previous purchases.  Have very touchy skin, so wear this as an undershirt.  Washes well; fits well (36 bust, small shoulders--wear an XS). Feels feminine.  Arrived quickly.",B0000E014L
I can be very cold natured in the winter.  I decided to give this product a try.  I am glad that I did.  This top is very light weight and not at all bulky.  It holds in your body heat very well.  I usually have to layer to stay warm. With this top I found myself taking extra layers off to be comfortable.  I am thrilled with the performance of the shirt.,B0000E014L
"Just what I was looking for in cold Chicago winters. It adds a layer of warmth without bulk. It has a pretty edging around the neck. The material is thin, so you need to take care that you don't snag it. Otherwise, just lovely!",B0000E014L
Very comfortable and perfect for another layer during our cold winter.,B0000E014L
"Sheer, basically good for an extra layer.",B0000E014L
"These are very nice, except that they are tissue-paper thin and I needed heavyweight ones, so I had to return these. It would be good if in the product description they could describe them as feather light or something so consumers would know the weight.",B0000E014L
"Perfect to be worn under anything, super warm",B0000E014L
Very soft.  Comfortable.  Nothing better than silk next to your skin !!!!!,B0000E014L
Perfect lightweight layer for my pretty evening tops. Thank you for offering can size!,B0000E014L
"Silk is it, lightweight and unbelievably warm. Rinse it out if you sweat in it though. The sizes seem true to fit.",B0000E014L
We really like it. Put our groceries in the cart instead of carrying the bags up we use the cart.,B0000UZ5GY
handy light weight great for what I wanted it for,B0000UZ5GY
"Did not fit the Honey Can Do cart...need  to find a liner, can you help",B0000UZ5GY
I use this little cart to pull my oxygen behind me and it fits my purse and anything I need it to.,B0000UZ5GY
"I am very disappointed in this product. I have a mini type cart much as pictured and ordered this liner. The product is not as described and in no way fits the cart at all, and certainly not as shown. It also has a terrible odor. I won't bother sending it back just another compromise. If I could I would give it no stars at all!",B0000UZ5GY
I really wanted to like this. I put it on and looked great. I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already. Maybe be good for smaller chest but didn't work for my 36DD bust.,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this because I have a couple other Felina bras and they fit perfectly, this one runs a bit big. The wire in the middle goes up really far so I have to wear a higher cut shirt when wearing this bra. It's fairly comfortable though and has enough support for a 34D.",B0000ZFDD4
I am very pleased with the way my breasts sit in this bra: forward and lifted. Felina is the only brand I've found for myself and I use it almost exclusively. Recommend.,B0000ZFDD4
"My Boobs never looked so good, just the right sexy & playfulness... I love it!
It fits great and feels comfortable, I am very satisfied with the product.",B0000ZFDD4
Felina products fit very well and are very confortable to wear for the whole day. Do watch for new styles to come out from them.,B0000ZFDD4
This is the BEST bra I've purchased in a long time.  It's very comfortable; fits perfectly.  I've had several comments from other women about the beauty of the straps!  I plan to purchase another one soon.,B0000ZFDD4
"I don't think I've had a sexy bra since I left the C-cup range in early high school. As a 32DD, I can't even find a bra and when I do, it's usually disappointingly elderly looking. This bra is sexy and beautiful. The straps don't seem too wide like many made for the bigger busted gals. The only thing is I doubt it will be very supportive, as my breasts are sitting out further from my sternum than I'd like, which means there's a little too much room to giggle...but if you're not concerned about that, get it!",B0000ZFDD4
"comfort, support, separation, this one has it all. and it lasts too. This is my second one, and I wish I could make all my bras this model,  but I need some smooth ones, too. that's the only gripe. Lace doesn't work under every fabric",B0000ZFDD4
"It is not uncomfortable, but the cup are cut weird. There is more room for the top for you boob even though the bottom half fits normal.",B0000ZFDD4
"It's my 3rd bra from this brand. I really love it, fit perfectly",B0000ZFDD4
Im in love with this bra! I have used it for 10 years. It does the job and well.,B0000ZFDD4
"Wonderful bra! Ordered this Felina bra on a whim as I had never purchased one before. Turned out to be a very pretty and supportive bra (acts like a push-up, but with no padding). Very lacy and sexy look. I always order 36B and this fit with no problems. Cups are double layer fabric (satin inside and lace outside), front of strap has decorative design and does not stretch (but the back of the strap does). Side panel has no boning, but I get no rolling up on the side...so overall I am very happy with this bra.",B0000ZFDD4
sexy and fits perfect. im a 32 ddd,B0000ZFDD4
Pretty. Comfortable. Decent support for a lace bra and I wear a 32 DD. Well made. Only bought in a nude color and going back for a black and white!,B0000ZFDD4
"In my photos:  my hand is showing what it could look like if the straps adjusted tighter or if I can get this professionally altered.  In the other I am wearing the bra with a sheer work style shirt.

This bra is similar to VS unlined Demi bras. VS doesnt make my size and I cant fit their version of the 38DDD unlined Demi.  Im normally a 38DDD/38F and the 38DDD cup size fit well.

The downsides of this bra: The straps are only partially adjustable not offering enough support to lift.  The straps are also oddly wide set.",B0000ZFDD4
The size and shape of the bra was completely off. I would not recommend buying this bra. Quality of the fabric was cheap and only last 4 times before ripping.,B0000ZFDD4
Nice bra.  Good quality.  Glad to have it.,B0000ZFDD4
"the fit seems to be off. I am a very petite woman who wears size 30ddd, i usually can fit into a 32dd but the cups were way too roomy. Im going to re-order a size down to 32c because i would like a snug fit.",B0000ZFDD4
Very nice bra. Fit true to size. Would have given 5 stars but lace at center bunches a bit. Overall very good and pleased. Will be ordering in other colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"I have bought 3 styles of Felina in 38 D, too tight in the chest and 40 D, too big in the cup and they all fit differently. I am now about to try 40 C in this one. My previous styles were exactly right but no longer are made. I still wear a bright turquoise lace bra I bought 13 years ago and the color hasn't even faded. Other than sizing this bra has a great curvy, not pointy, silhouette and is so comfortable. The underwire is small enough not to dig in.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great, comfortable and beautiful bra. I have had it for a year now and they are still in great condition after biweekly washes. They are comfortable enough for daily wear and sexy enough to dress up with a thong and thigh highs. I ended up purchasing many different colors. They are true to size. Great buy!",B0000ZFDD4
Not having seen Felina in many years I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Amazon.  Nice construction and great fit.,B0000ZFDD4
"Not only is it beautiful, but it's so well crafted!",B0000ZFDD4
The only bra I will wear! Comfy and beautiful and wearable for a long time.,B0000ZFDD4
"Lace was kinda itchy, band felt tighter than expected; hoping it will loosen up after a few wears.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love Felina's sizing.  First time in my life a bra fits like it should!  And they are so pretty!  Impossible to find such pretty bras in my local dept stores. At least where I go. They are pretty fragile tho  I hand wash mine. Hang dry.  And I'm not sure how much support they would provide to someone else.  If you have a lot of sag, it MIGHT not be right for you, but for me it works perfectly.",B0000ZFDD4
"MY FAVORITE BRA! I wear a 36DD and it fits perfectly, is comfortable, sexy and affordable. Can't believe I can order a bra that will reliably fit online!",B0000ZFDD4
"Liked it, but ordered the wrong size.",B0000ZFDD4
The bra is nice looking which is why I gave it 2 stars but the material is really flimsy & it didn't fit well. It was loose at the top of the cup. Like not a lot or anything. Just no support. I am sending it back bc while I could live with that I can't deal with wire in the middle stabbing me in my chest. It goes too high in the middle & there are wires all the way up so I bent over & into my chest it went. Just not a great fit or thought to it.,B0000ZFDD4
Cut bra but it is very uncomfortable and did not shap my 36dd breast they way a good bra should.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra (34 C) is well crafted and very pretty. Looks and fits me just like the photo shows. It is not a stretchy lace, so very supportive, but unlike the Delimira full coverage lace bra, this bra can not be used for nursing/breastfeeding. The Delimira bra has stretchy lace, and the top edge is sewn in a way that it also stretches, allowing it to be pulled down to nurse. I was hoping this bra would work out for that, but I returned because it will not. When I am no longer nursing, I will definitely buy this bra again!",B0000ZFDD4
"it is the most beautiful bra
the drawback is that it does not hold the breast well
also if you are willing to hand wash it will not last long",B0000ZFDD4
Love this bra so much i ordered three more. It's so hard to find an inexpensive bra that actually fits well.,B0000ZFDD4
Very soft and comfortable. Fits as expected.,B0000ZFDD4
"Great bra. Very supportive for being unlined. Very pretty too. Not the most comfortable, but not bad at all.",B0000ZFDD4
...and easier access to myself with the lace.,B0000ZFDD4
Really pretty but runs a bit small. The 36 fits like 34,B0000ZFDD4
I bought the size I typically do with other brands. My advice is to go down a cup. The lace is just ok quality-wise and feels scratchy. After half an hour of wearing this I changed into another bra because it felt abrasive against my skin.,B0000ZFDD4
"I have implants 34dd and unless i bought VS no bra could fit right, small cups in most cases.  I found this brand in C21 but now I'm gonna shop here!!",B0000ZFDD4
"I suggest sizing down on the band, the material is very stretchy. Cups fit well, material is nice.",B0000ZFDD4
"Really pretty but the cups are a bit weird. Makes the girls a bit wonky and skewed.
Much like there's a search party going on at my elbows and the ladies are trying to help search too.
A definite ""what the heck"" moment.
I'm giving 3 stars bc the rest of the bra is well made and it's  (again) really pretty.",B0000ZFDD4
"So pretty and fits perfectly. Was worried about buying online, but it's beautiful, comfortable and supports without padding.",B0000ZFDD4
"Was a bit bigger and the inside lining also started to come undone after 1 wash. I might have needed a cup size down, on the size but after the wash I don't think I would order another.",B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty really liked it. There is absolutely no padding just lace and a really thin liner which defeats the purpose of wearing a bra. I have to insert some padding from sports bras or else my niples just poke right through it.,B0000ZFDD4
It's really pretty but way too big for me and I bought it in the size I currently wear??,B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra. Gives plenty of support, yet it is comfortable. Also, it is very sexy.",B0000ZFDD4
"Helps my back pain. Holds the waight of 34DD purfectley! Looks great,feels amazing",B0000ZFDD4
"I am well pleased!!!!fits perfectly! !I bought 32dd, very hard to find",B0000ZFDD4
Well made but not made for large bust,B0000ZFDD4
Not exactly sure what is wrong with this bra.  May be the right size but makes my girls sag really bad.  I had the nerve to order two of them so one is not opened and I waited too late to return so a total waste of money being that I will never wear it and I don't know anyone else my size to give it too. Bummer.,B0000ZFDD4
Very beautiful bra but it runs on the small side.,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits nice with good lift , materials are nice also. I would of given 5 star but I ordered a DD just a tad small .",B0000ZFDD4
Wasn't exactly what I expected.,B0000ZFDD4
Perfect fit! Nice full coverage. Will buy more.,B0000ZFDD4
"Bought the alabaster color in my size, the 32DDD, and it fit good. I felt like the top of the bra cups were a little too loose and needed to be cinched in towards the middle where the underwire meets above breast bone but maybe it's me and not the bra. It's super sexy and my husband really liked it. It was see through some but that's ok. Will probably buy other colors.",B0000ZFDD4
True to size. I'm between a C and D cup so I always go with D. Fits perfect. It has no padding. Just lined with a sheer mesh type fabric. Very pretty. I will be purchasing more in different colors.,B0000ZFDD4
I ordered a 36D and it fits perfectly. The quality is good and fair for the price and it is a pretty bra! I am happy with it.,B0000ZFDD4
Love this one - the fit and feel - ordered another one!,B0000ZFDD4
I wear DDD and this is the firts bra that looks sexy and is able to hold up my girls. My husband lives it too. Will buy more.,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits and looks great. I'm not sure how durable it's going to be, but so far I'm pleased with it.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra, fits really nice and it's extremely comfy. I will definitely more just like it !!",B0000ZFDD4
it was too small and didn't fit her well,B0000ZFDD4
First day wearing this bra was a bit uncomfortable - the underwire was digging a bit and the straps were a little tight. But after wearing it in a bit I can say that it is definitely the best bra I've worn in a long time. Very supportive and comfortable. I can't wait to stock up on all the colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits very well.  The cups are deep enough that I don't spill out of the top, which is hard to find for me.  Although the straps are narrow, the band is wide enough and supportive enough that it is comfortable to wear all day. I wear a 32 DD or DDD.",B0000ZFDD4
"Awful, way too tight and unflattering. Hopefully returning soon.",B0000ZFDD4
This is the most comfortable sexy bra I own - I have it in several colors...........love this bra. I am a 34DDD - so anyone can wear this bra and enjoy this lacy number.,B0000ZFDD4
I bought and returned two bras before i bought the third one. I am too tired to make another trip to the post office to return it. The sizing is not correct and the fitting is terrible. I will not recommend anyone else to buy this.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is one gorgeous and sexy bra! I love Felina. The color 'Bermuda' is much prettier than in the picture. The fit is great. I usually wear a 32DDD, but in this bra I actually had to size down to a 32DD. Usually most bras are too small in the cup, but Felina seems to be generous, which I appreciate. This bra provides good support and though it will show through most clothing B/C of the seams and being it is lace, it is a really pretty bra and would be fine under thicker sweaters. (I also bought the matching thong in a medium, and it fits very well also. I weigh 114. Very happy w/ both and will def continue to purchase Felina lingerie.)",B0000ZFDD4
Poor quality of material. I returned it.,B0000ZFDD4
"It fit good, everything inside, nothing falling out at the top or sides. But I would of preferred if I could of adjusted the strap length... shortened it a lil'.",B0000ZFDD4
first wear it came appart. not happy at all,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra; my size changed and I had to return.  But bra was beautiful and perfect.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love the lift and shaping, just a bit small on the cup size but still fits ok.",B0000ZFDD4
"It fell apart after only a month, sizing was off too. It fell apart after only a month, sizing was off too.",B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a 40DD US, 40E UK. I read the reviews before buyng. The material is great, this is a semi transparent bra with a light lining. Good fit in the cups, underwire and straps. I adjusted straps to lengthen them and they stayed on my shoulders. Minor gap at top cup border, not really due to too large a cup. Adjusting my breast eliminated most of it. Continue reading for the rest.

Underwire fit me fine, tight to athe sternum. I could have bent it slightly to ease that. Problem was the straps. They were a good length and I had to lengthen them, but they bear too mich weight from the cups. So between my collarbone and the top of cup, they never touched my chest, did not lay flat because of weight from the cups. Moving them in a little closer to neck caused more gap at top of cup.

The band is true to fit and the back lay just as it should. However, at the bottom of the center gore the lining is not attached to the lace. Both the lining tbere, and the band tend to roll up there.

If your breasts have more volume on top, aren't that heavy, and are not close together, this bra may work for you. If not for the straps not laying on my chest in front, I would have kept it.",B0000ZFDD4
"very nice bra, my size is 34D & I thought the fit was nice, however the material is a bit itchy. For the price I was satisfied.",B0000ZFDD4
"Kind of itchy, but fits comfortably",B0000ZFDD4
"fits well and isn't stifleing in padding, sexy and a brighter red then in the picture",B0000ZFDD4
"very nice, pretty lacy bra. no complaints at all! yay!",B0000ZFDD4
"i love them they fit so perfect, and very good material. i will buy some more",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is not only lovely but fits very well.,B0000ZFDD4
I am 34 D and it fits great and it's really comfortable. But most of all its so pretty.,B0000ZFDD4
"Somewhat itchy lace; but otherwise fits as expected (if not a tiny bit small). Not for everyday wear, though as there is not a ton of coverage.",B0000ZFDD4
"I really love the look of this bra! It is really very beautifully and intricately detailed. I  usually wear a 38DD, but ordered a 38DDD. Unfortunately, had I had ordered my regular size, this bra would be really tight and very uncomfortable, however, considering the larger size, this bra fits nicely. The band stretches nicely, the straps are largely adjustable and the cups offer modest coverage with out those annoying ""hangover lines"" . I am built a little heavier and have a large chest, I felt like the ""normal"" bra material really emphasized my bust size with all of the extra padding. The lace material allows me to dress modestly and not feel like my chest is the first thing noticed. The material tends to get a little itchy when worn for longer periods of time, but its not at all unbearable. I love the nude alabaster color, it blends nicely under most any colored top besides white.",B0000ZFDD4
Horrible! Bra was fine for the first couple wears but the cups do not hold their shape and look all stretched out and saggy!!! I would not buy again. Waste of $,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra.. Just did not fit,B0000ZFDD4
"I don't understand where all of the negative reviews are coming from; I haven't taken it off since I put it on!

The fit is great and it is supportive.. I purchased the black/nude shade and I swear I had bought the exact same bra from vicky's secrets years ago.. it is a dead ringer for one I used to have a long time ago..

Anyway, I am 38DD and that is what I ordered.. There are no problems with the fit; I find it is perfectly true to size.. The material is not itchy, the cut is supportive and the lace is sexy (though, I do have a thing for black lace..)

What more can one expect from a moderately priced bra? I can see this lasting me for years with proper care.. I love it!",B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra ...Have at least six ...Comfortable and washes well .,B0000ZFDD4
Bought this same brand in three sizes 34ddd 36ddd 38ddd in two colors. Never the right fit. Never the same fit in different colors. Horrible.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's a beautiful bra. Very sexy. My husband was very appreciative.  I read in some reviews that the material was itchy and scratchy, but I didn't have that problem. I just hand washed it before wearing, and it worked fine.",B0000ZFDD4
"Let me start by saying that even with 38DDD breasts, this bra *nearly* feels like you're wearing nothing. Of course, no bra is perfect, and any way you cut it, you're still strapping metal and lace to your body in an attempt to lift, separate, and otherwise wrangle a few hefty handfuls of fat, so there will be some discomfort.

PROS:
- No side ""boning."" You know--that absolutely infuriating two-inch long piece of pokey plastic that most bras have, that can only be assumed is a half-assed attempt at controlling your side fat? That doohickey is 100% the worst. I usually cut it out of bras, because within about an hour of wearing a new bra, that side-boob contraption becomes a barbed wire fence, rolling at the hems and poking you incessantly. You know what I'm talking about. No side boning in this one. Thank the heavens.
- The shape is nice and natural, with enough lift to get the job done. I've avoided unlined bras for years, after an annoying Cleo experience (nobody wants triangle-shaped boobs, amirite? So why do they keep making bras that make our boobs look like triangles?? This bra does not do that).
- It feels absolutely divine. Really, it just feels like wearing nothing at all.
- NO UGLY CONTRAST LACE! I'm so sick of extended-sized bras with weird shiny lace all over the place. I wanted something understated but sexy, and I think this delivers.

CONS:
- The straps... I love that this bra doesn't have gigantic, inch-wide straps. These ones are actually kind of pretty! I wouldn't be ashamed if they showed a little bit with a sleeveless top or something. But the scalloped edges aren't super comfortable. And, admittedly, wide straps exist to lighten your load, so these thin (but pretty!) straps are making this bra slightly uncomfortable. I can deal with it, though.
- The sizing isn't consistent with the other Felina bra I have, to the point where I really probably *shouldn't* be wearing this bra. My other Felina is a 38DDD and fits like a glove. It's supportive and (somewhat) comfy (Oy, the side boning). I figured this bra would be nearly identical, but it isn't. The band is much too large (fails the 2-finger test, even on the tightest setting), and the cups are the teensiest bit baggy. Obviously baggy is better, aesthetically, than muffintop, but baggy isn't great in the long run when it comes to protecting your spine. So that's annoying.

With the above concerns in mind, my first thought was to size down and get a 36G (which is what I wear in nearly every other brand of bras), but--alas!--this model of Felina doesn't offer that size. Really unfortunate. That said, this bra is super comfy, and the price was right, so I'll be keeping it in the size it is. I just won't wear it on days I know I'll need a ton of support.

Would buy again, but only if Felina increases their sizing.",B0000ZFDD4
The pink bra looked very cheap and it didn't last a year.  The right under wire came out and it fits a little loose.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's very pretty and comfortable for an underwire bra. I hate padding in bras but I have big boobs, so I kind of need the underwire. I wore this bra almost exclusively for the entire summer, and hand washed it only, and it has held up well.",B0000ZFDD4
So sorry - had to return these bras - unfortunately they don't fit my body style. My error.  I am sure others love this bra.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is terribley uncomfortable. The straps dig into my shoulders and leave impressions and soreness. It's pretty, but I'll never wear it for longer than an hour again.",B0000ZFDD4
Very cute but not comfortable to wear all day.,B0000ZFDD4
"I tried this bra for the first time and I FINALLY found a bra for bigger boobs that actually supports and lifts while still offering a sexy feminine look for the bigger boob women! Having big boobs, it's hard finding bras that support AND look sexy. I usually have to buy bras that window washers could use as holsters! Ugly, tight elastic bras. I've already a variety of colors. Women with double d's, you will love these bras, and so will your men!",B0000ZFDD4
"I originally purchased this in my measured size but it was slightly too big so I returned to size down and the fit was perfect.  The material is soft even though it's lace and it's very feminine while still providing ample support.  I am going to order this in more colors now that I am finally wearing the right size!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",B0000ZFDD4
A little snug on the band. I use 32/34. Bought a 34 and fits a little tight. And the cup is Demi. So if you need it to cover more of the top part gert one size bigger,B0000ZFDD4
I am in love with this Bra!!! It fits perfectly and does the sexy lift and separate...I plan to order all of the colors:),B0000ZFDD4
"The cup sizes run quite large.  In a Wacoal I wear a ""C""; this one the wire nearly killed me so I took them out.  Now I have a comfortable flappy bra:)  I'd say go down a cup size.  You'll have to be the judge, though.",B0000ZFDD4
Adorable bra but didn't last long.,B0000ZFDD4
not very good quality - you get what you pay for,B0000ZFDD4
"I used to work at VS, but I simply can't afford their bras right now. I'm a 36D in Victorias Secret & this fit true to size. I actually measure at 35, so the lace is great because it's a little tighter than other materials. Great support, nice and thin materials for summer comfort, sexy lace, and sturdy straps. I'm including some pix. In one of them I'm demonstrating with my fingers how opaque the thin piece of nude material behind the lace is for modesty. One finger is completely behind both layers, the other is behind the lace only, & the other is on top. I don't think this would be a good bra for smaller frames & sizes. 32C & up. Hope this helps & that my photos are helpful for the fit & not offensive.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love it, it really enhances the girls and being a trans girl that's important",B0000ZFDD4
Better bra for someone who has small bust.,B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty but not as supportive as I'd like.,B0000ZFDD4
This bra is cut weird cause it make your boobs push out pointy and the material sags and pinches oddly. The color is exactly as shown on here though. Not see through maybe if your white and dark nipples it may be see through but I am literally Light brown skin so nothing about this bra is see through,B0000ZFDD4
"Even though this doesn't quite fit as perfectly as I'd like... it's still one of my favorite bras right now. Very cute and rather comfortable, even for a fuller figure. I may try a different size to see if I can get a better fit.",B0000ZFDD4
"First of all, this is not a padded bra but I'd does have enough lining to cover. It looks smooth under t-shirts if you get the right fit. I should have ordered exactly according to the size chart, but I read reviews that said order a size up on the band, and that was a mistake. I measured 34 in the band and the 34 fits perfectly. If you go by the size chart for inches between band size and fullest part of bust measurement, you will get the correct size, too. This may be VERY different from the size you have been wearing! For me, every time I have been fitted they have said I was 36 and DDD but the cups always gapped and puckered, well since I followed the chart recommendations this one fits like a glove. I ordered a 36DDD and a 34DDD the 36 gaped just like my old bras, but the 34 did not. I've learned from this experience that the band fit is just as important as the cup size. Also, some reviews said the material was scratchy or not great quality. All of the ones I have ( I now have 4) feel great and are as well made as any bras I have ever had. I hope this helps others get the correct fit, because I am so pleased with the way this looks, very flattering and sexy, not at all like the lady bras you get when you order ""plus"" size bras. I'm do glad to find a bra that fits my size and looks good too. I'm going to order a good supply because you know how hard it is to find a bra that fits-and then they change or discontinue it!",B0000ZFDD4
"The first day I wore this bra I was impressed by how comfortable it was.  The support was great.  The next time I wore it I felt the underwire poking me.  When I took it off, I found that the underwire is not secure.  It shifts.  I was able to move it back into place but it doesnt stay there.  Very disappointing.",B0000ZFDD4
Perfect bra. Pretty and fits well.,B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra. Im a 38 DDD and its beautiful,B0000ZFDD4
Strange cup size made for lumpy boobs.,B0000ZFDD4
Fits perfect. Hard to find a good comfortable fit for big boobs.,B0000ZFDD4
The adjustment is limited so I couldn't really adjust to the right fit.,B0000ZFDD4
"The lace provides very little support, but it's still a cute bra.",B0000ZFDD4
Bought the 34DDD fits like a dream! At last an affordable cute bra in my size,B0000ZFDD4
I love it! It looks great on I just had a breast lift and implants and I just wanted something while I'm still healing to give just a little support and I'm gonna order another. Very happy,B0000ZFDD4
"The most comfortable unlined bra I own aside from Victoria's Secret. It's fit was a little big along the top part of the sides near the arm pit, but that just as easily could be from body uniqueness. The lace is beatifil and has lasted quite a few washes already.",B0000ZFDD4
Way too small and almost no support,B0000ZFDD4
"Beautiful, sexy,Lacey!  Excellent fit.  Love it. Will likely order more colors. Thanks!",B0000ZFDD4
Looks wonderful and the cups fit well...,B0000ZFDD4
"I really like the look of this bra.  The details on the straps are gorgeous.  I've worn it all day with no issues.  Fits just like a demi bra should, and its gorgeous too.",B0000ZFDD4
I'm back to buy again.  Had this a few years ago.  Wore it until it wore out. Stretched out too much and started looking ratty.  It was worth every penny.  Hugged my 34DDs well and gave a nice fleshy feel.  (I prefer a little natural  springy movement and no padding).  Bending over didn't work out so well with this.  Great bra for lower cut tops when I want to feel a little special.,B0000ZFDD4
"This arrived today.  I tried it on,  and it's absolutely perfect!  Very comfortable.  I will be purchasing more!",B0000ZFDD4
"The lining is the right size, but the lace is too big for the lining.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love the bra, it looks exactly like the picture and arrived early.",B0000ZFDD4
"It is incredibly hard to get bras in my size-especially when you don't want to spend $70.  I ordered this bra with low expectations, feeling like I would probably be sending it back.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  The fit is great, the material is sturdy.  I absolutely love it.  I can't believe how wonderful it is for the price.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have worn this beautiful bra for years, the balconette style presents a lovely decolletage. This is an ideal bra to wear beneath low cut tops, the lace detail on the cups looks sexy enough to to invite a peek.
Several of the colors have a contrasting lining with the same color ribbon woven into the straps. I cannot say enough good things about the Harlow.
I will say when I originally purchased this style I was surprised by the measurement of the back strap. It is 3 hooks high. Also, the lace on the cups is textured, and noticeable under smooth clothing.",B0000ZFDD4
Happy to find this bra have worn for years and like the bra with lower cut tops.  I have it in black also.searchef,B0000ZFDD4
Have the same bra in a different color so I decided to order this one and it was strangely toooo large and definitely not the same size,B0000ZFDD4
"much brighter than expected. At first I thought i was sent the wrong color. Practically neon. Baggy and poorly fitting, like I ordered a DDD and got an E or F.",B0000ZFDD4
"I was conflicted about whether to order this bra.  I love the look of it and was excited for the wider band, but was concerned the cup would not offer much in the way of support... and I was right.  It looks great and the fabric feels nice.  The lace is beautiful and a bit stretchy.  However, I get more support from a cami than I do this bra.  There is a very thin lining and no padding at all.  I will be returning the bra for a refund.",B0000ZFDD4
Good considering it is an underwire but definitely not an 18 hour bra.  It is just not that comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
Fits pretty good. Definitely good for larger breasts.,B0000ZFDD4
"Its nice to look at but too small for my Double D's, I ordered it in the size that should fit yet this was still too small. This was the last and only bra I ordered online, bras are something I think I will have to do in person.",B0000ZFDD4
Gorgeous color and perfect fit!,B0000ZFDD4
"I wanted something sexy. This bra is sexy, and pretty. My only complaint is it doesn't have any padding at all, and practically 0 support. It's just lace, and under wire. So unless you have perfectly shaped boobs, or 100% comfortable with the way you are then this probably isn't the bra for you. With it being just lace it doesn't give you any shape. I would not recommend it for a everyday bra, only romantic times.",B0000ZFDD4
"Good product, runs large.  Should've gone one cup smaller.",B0000ZFDD4
"The straps are to long, and doesn't offer much support.",B0000ZFDD4
"great fit, doesn't jab me anywhere, very durable and I feel great in it! If you're looking for something sexy AND supportive, you've found it!",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is beautiful! It is not padded but very comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
"Gorgeous color and great fit, will definitely be buying more!",B0000ZFDD4
"Fabric a bit flimsy, pretty bra though.",B0000ZFDD4
Is a great bra for a big breasted woman trap in a small figure !!! I'm a 34ddd maybe even FF but this bra was perfect the only thing is I was not to in press with the fabric looks like is going to rip soon ... Hope not but overall great fit,B0000ZFDD4
"All my large chested women know, it can be difficult finding bras in our size.  I bought this beautiful bra in a 38DDD and it's perfect and reasonably priced. Arrived on time, comfortable and I will probably buy more in different colors.",B0000ZFDD4
Great fit. Awesome lift. Would buy again.,B0000ZFDD4
"Ok I'm 5,9 were a 32 ddd yes there are real but it's hard for me to find bars that fit me and don't make them look funny but this is the best one iv got in a long time I love the way it make me fell I would walk around my house in only this and the underwear I got with this I got both of them In red like I said I got a 32ddd and a m underwear its very sexy",B0000ZFDD4
"This is an attractive bra, fits as expected.

This is an attractive bra. I have a D cup and the bra  does not quite cover the bust, but not a problem. The color is bright and the fabric is very  comfortable on the skin.",B0000ZFDD4
Fits great!  Looks great!  Beautiful bra.,B0000ZFDD4
I like this bra the only thing is that no matter how tight or loose the straps are they keep sliping off my shoulders and I have to use a paperclip to hold them up but otherwise I like the bra and it feels great ( :,B0000ZFDD4
"I haven't had a bra fit me this well, ever!",B0000ZFDD4
"As a large busted lady I have always had issues with finding the right bra. My back is narrow and bust size is DDD. Felina, Simone Perele & Chantelle are in my opinion the best ones out there! Great coverage & very flattering. It's hard to find a great looking bra, that also makes u feel good about yourself especially being a size 32/34 DDD",B0000ZFDD4
"If you have large breasts this bra isn't for you. The straps are very stretchy in the front, so they don't provide support. You'll be bouncing all over the place.",B0000ZFDD4
"It would have been great but the straps were too long, no support",B0000ZFDD4
"Full coverage for gals with larger chests. The color is so pretty and the fit is perfect. My boobs were contained all day and I was actually comfortable! I had no spillage on the top, which normally happens when I get demi bras (I got 36D) I will definitely be buying more of these bras!",B0000ZFDD4
"I purchased the 32D bra and it's very snug. It has 3 separate hooks (a total of 9 hooks) so if it's too tight, you can loosen it. The straps are wide and sturdy. There is no padding in the cups. It's thin material. So the middle of the cups look kind of weird to me but for $11 I'll keep it. It's very beautiful! It arrived on time. I might purchase again if other colors go on sale.",B0000ZFDD4
It's a pretty bra. Good quality. I'm a true 34DDD but could have taken this bra in a DD,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought and really liked it. I am planning to buy other colors as well, in addition to the blue one",B0000ZFDD4
"Very nice bra, but did not fit me as well as Felina Monica style, which is perfect. Had to return for fit.",B0000ZFDD4
Pretty bra with a nice fit for larger breasts.,B0000ZFDD4
"Wires had to be bent out to keep from rubbing my chest,  overall a great bra.",B0000ZFDD4
This is a super sexy bra. Crossdressing guy here. This holds my forms wonderfully and is so sexy. I wear 38d and this fits perfectly. So cute.,B0000ZFDD4
My wife loves this bra. It was very different from her typical padded bras however she likes the natural feel with just enough support. Looks great as well.,B0000ZFDD4
"My favorite bra ever! So cute and comfortable, and the fit was so perfect when I first got it. Unfortunately it stretched out quickly due to me wearing it pretty much every day. I might buy more of these in the future and cycle through them so that they last longer. The color of the lace is much more vibrant in person (which I loved, but if you are looking for a more pale/pastel bra, this may not be exactly what you want).",B0000ZFDD4
this seemed to fit me a little large than expected.,B0000ZFDD4
"A little tight for a 38,  cups are snug.",B0000ZFDD4
No padding and the bra is a bit unconfortable. Will not be buying again.,B0000ZFDD4
Poor quality lace and it is really uncomfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
Fits well and looks great.  Exactly what I was looking for.,B0000ZFDD4
Im a 34DD and these fit amazing and perfect. I have Breast augmentation and wanted something with out a lot of padding and this is the bra I've been looking for.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's pretty but the straps are too long so you can't adjust them to where you'd like. I have a small back and small shoulders but a huge rack so being able to adjust it is really important. I can't wear this if I'm doing anything even a tiny bit jiggly. Otherwise, it's pretty and flattering when it fits right.",B0000ZFDD4
"I wasn't sure whether I should list this as ""somewhat small"" or ""somewhat large"" because the cups are a bit big while the band size is so tight! I'm a 32DDD through and through, so I know I bought the right size. It's a pretty bra, but I can't see myself wearing it too often because of these difficulties. It unfortunately might be a ""bedroom only"" bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"It was very uncomfortable and rough, and did nothing to support me. It looked lovely, but that wasn't enough. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because of the easy return.",B0000ZFDD4
"Lots of bras claim to be a large cup size and are not. This DDD cup size delivers as spacious enough. I am excited to find a bra that fits comfortably that when I Bend over things stay in place and
don't spill out.",B0000ZFDD4
"I bought a black bra and a white bra over a year ago and absolutely loved them.  I'm big chested and it's hard to find a good bra that isn't padded so I was ecstatic I found these.  Recently I bought the blue and light pink bras and am very disappointed, I wore the blue bra a couple times before the wire came out.  So I checked the pink one and it doesn't look like it will last much longer either, where the wire is looks worn.
I've had these less than a month.",B0000ZFDD4
"This does not fit a 40DDD lady as the picture would show even with the straps doubled up all the way. Very comfortable, but does not look cute. There is a lot of area that sticks out on the side of the bra.",B0000ZFDD4
Not the best support but who cares. It's an indoor bra. The fabric is so lovely. The lilac color is so dreamy. I'd buy it again.,B0000ZFDD4
Wire poked through after 6 months of wear.,B0000ZFDD4
"I am a size 38DDD. I thought I would play it safe and order one size larger because I thought just maybe it would be a little too small. Nope, the larger size was too big. So just be sure to order the size that you are. I switched it out for a 38DDD and it fits perfectly.
Now, about the bra....it is a beautiful bra! I have a difficult time finding very pretty lacy bras and this one is perfect. I just got it today and have worn it all day, so far it is comfortable and supportive and I love the balcony style it gives me. It is supportive yet I feel free. This bra may not work for everyone because some people find under-wire bras uncomfortable, but I am so used to under-wire bras that I don't really notice it's there.
I saw that some of the reviews on here said that the straps are too long. Not for me. I appreciate the long straps because I prefer to let my chest be natural; I don't care for the ""pull yourself up as high as possible style"". I like the natural look.
A very pretty bra, I recommend for every lady either to just wear on special occasions or more often.",B0000ZFDD4
I LOVE THIS BRA!  I had to send my UK34DD back ONLY because the stitching was missing in the inner center where the underwire would poke out.  I am excited to get my replacement and begin wearing it ASAP!  The lace is NOT scratchy and it seems to be well-made for the price.  I am a happy customer!,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this recently in the chrome/silver color. It's extremely sexy,and beautiful. I forgot that it's unlined, but I can wear it with t-shirts nothing too sheer. I have had problems in the past finding good bras. This is my second felina bra, it did dig a little underneath my breasts but it's not bad. It fits somewhat better than other bras I have, definitely want more of felina since they have beautiful designs and aren't as expensive as Victoria's Secret.",B0000ZFDD4
Very very good quality and fits perfect,B0000ZFDD4
This bra is great if you like having your nipples pop out every time you bend over.,B0000ZFDD4
It is pretty. The lace is soft but itchy and the underwire poked at the sides. Going to the cute but wear infrequently pile.,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful and sexy! So excited to see lift in a 36 DDD while still being pretty! Only one reason this didn't get 5 stars: straps are so long! I wish I was able to make them shorter! Hint: hand wash gently!,B0000ZFDD4
Cute not much support if you are gifted with larger than C cup.,B0000ZFDD4
The bra was comfortable and fit perfect but didn't last long before the under wire came out,B0000ZFDD4
"Very nice, looks great, good material",B0000ZFDD4
I wanted to love this bra but it was more like wearing Armour.  The band size was exactly right but the cups were too big (I ordered a D cup) overall it was not comfortable at all.,B0000ZFDD4
"The wire in this bra is too short for the channel so if it has worked it's way to the center front of the bra it is digging in your side and is VERY painful and uncomfortable.
I love the styling and appearance of the bra but unless you are willing to put a tack to prevent the wire from sliding or are willing to keep shifting it into your arm pit it is going to be unwearable.",B0000ZFDD4
"Cups are loose on the top edge of the bra in my true size, 34D even at tightest settings. May try 34C to see if that fixes. Otherwise a beautiful single-layer balconet that's not full of unnecessary stuffing.",B0000ZFDD4
There is a weird double layer of sheer material in this bra that I couldn't get to lie flat. I found the bra slightly uncomfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
Very comfy. There is no padding at all. The lace is put in such a way it gives a little support. Wash by hand only. The band and straps are long enough.,B0000ZFDD4
"The bra looked beautiful but the fit was atrocious. The cup was too large and offered no support, and it was impossible to tighten the straps adequately, so they hung loose. Honestly, I can't even tell what size I would have to order in this bra to get a good fit.  Someone needs to go back to the drawing board with this, I think.",B0000ZFDD4
Gives large breast a strange shape,B0000ZFDD4
"A little less substantial than I expected from photos, but it's served me well for about 6 months.  The matching panties are comfy and look great even on my XL butt.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra. Definitely lifts and separates.,B0000ZFDD4
Very comfortable bra as well as beautiful. Fits true to size.,B0000ZFDD4
"Bra doesn't really do much for my boobs if I'm wearing it under my clothes, BUT it is very pretty if that's all you're wearing (;",B0000ZFDD4
"I LOVE this bra.  I love Felina, they fit me great.  It is really hard to find alluring bras in a 40D and this one is beautiful and sexy but also supportive.  I highly recommend it.  It feels very comfortable and looks pretty.  I will be purchasing more.",B0000ZFDD4
"It fits perfect, give you support, it feels very confortable and looks beautiful",B0000ZFDD4
Absolutely does not fit.  I can't wear it.,B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is unmolded, but it does look just like the picture. When I tried it on, it was a little small, maybe a cup smaller. Therefore I returned it.",B0000ZFDD4
It's ok I took the label off so I can't return it. So I'm stuck with them,B0000ZFDD4
"i LOVE all the Felina Harlow bras!!!!!!!!!!!  I fear the day they don't make them anymore!!  As with large boobs and underwire bras, I just wish they lasted forever, but eventually the wire does poke through.",B0000ZFDD4
felina is a great brand for lingerie! the bra fits and looks great.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love these bras, very comfortable. I wish I would have ordered a cup size smaller though. They are just a little loose in the cup and stretch as bit.",B0000ZFDD4
"I don't really like this bra but I don't hate it either.  The cup size is a bit strange and it doesn't seem to support like it should.  The lace is cute, but doesn't really add much coverage.",B0000ZFDD4
"Decorative lace i sewn to a thin fabric to form the cup, and the lace seems like it's a bit too big so it flips up which is aesthetically irritating but you can't really tell with a shirt on. Otherwise fits great and is very comfortable!",B0000ZFDD4
"It fits pretty nicely, but the color was completely unexpected! I ordered ""Azalea"" which is kind of a dusty, subtle, cool pink, and I got a bra that was a shocking bubblegum pink! Like seriously it is SO bright. Thankfully I like bright pink too, so it's not an issue. In fact, it's really my only complaint about the bra.

Edit: I had originally left a higher, positive review, but I have to change that now. I've owned this bra less than two weeks and the underwire already broke through the front. Thankfully there are a few ways to fix this problem, but I really think if you spend $30 on a bra it shouldn't fall apart in less than two weeks. Talk about flimsy. Between that and getting a bra in the wrong color, I really wouldn't advise anyone else to spend money on this product.",B0000ZFDD4
"It is absolutely beautiful and comfortable! I was a little worried how this would fit, because I do not have the same body as the model. I will purchase again.",B0000ZFDD4
"It fits well, 5 stars on that.  I gave it 3 stars because it makes my girls look too pointy!  Also an unlined bra on larger chested women doesn't seem to work to well.  The underwire digs in close to the arm pits.  These are the reasons I sent it back.

There are a couple good things it's sexy for one.  And 2 it has a space between the lace and inner lining for a pad or support.

If you are looking for lingerie and won't wear it all day, then go for it!
If you are looking for a sexy comfortable bra, I would look elsewhere!!",B0000ZFDD4
"I ordered a 36 B, it was tight using the last hook.
I am 5'2"", 132 lbs. I returned the Bra because it was not 100% black.
It had a brown interface. It I better on a person who is taller I think.
It did not fit me like the model.  It was very low cut. I gave it 5 stars
for the price and fine quality.",B0000ZFDD4
Perfect fit! I now want one in every color.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is cute but it doesn't let you adjust the straps very good and it was about 2 cup sizes too big. I buy this same bra size off places all the time and read the ""measurements."" really upset they are dramatically off.",B0000ZFDD4
Very sexy and cute. Will definitely order more. The matching underwear is adorable too,B0000ZFDD4
"Ended up tossing this one after trying two different sizes. It was pretty, however the straps and design was not supportive enough. After eating it my breasts started popping out (muffin topping out of the top of the bra) and it was embarrassing. Also there was a weird pucker with the fabric near the straps. Honestly, if you have a large chest and a small waist I would recommend a Wacoal bra, the Embrace is a fantastic lacy option.",B0000ZFDD4
Straps are a little uncomfortable and scratchy,B0000ZFDD4
"The fit was awkward for me, so had to be returned. The cup size was fine, but I think my breasts are too heavy for this type of bra. They needed more support.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra seemed comfortable, but the cup was larger than expected.  I had to return for a smaller cup size.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is a bit uncomfortable and smaller than expected. I can wear it an entire day, but it's not a top pick daily. It's a great price, but it's not comfortable enough to wear on a regular basis.",B0000ZFDD4
Attractive. Fits well. Agree with those who feel it is not all day support - but great for low impact days or going out special.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love this bra!!! I ended up buying duplicates in several colors. It has taken forever to find a great bra and this one is awesome! It fits well (which is a challenge) but is also comfortable, cute and sexy. (Had to add in thin pads to cover nipples but still love this bra!)",B0000ZFDD4
Very nice line of clothing accessories.  Fit my wife perfectly.,B0000ZFDD4
"Ordered in my size, received it in the mail in a timely fashion, tried it on, and it fit too large. I have returned it.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is super pretty but it is not lined!,B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty and comfortable.  It is hard to find this style of bra in my size.,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful brazierre and a lovely brand. Removed the tags too quickly!,B0000ZFDD4
"This is the most comfortable and sexy bra I have tried in a long time.  I was very cautious buying online, but I just ordered 2 more.  As a large chested woman, I have a difficult time finding a bra that fits well, comfortably and looks nice as well.  Very sexy, very excited to bring these along on an upcoming romantic vacation!",B0000ZFDD4
"Wow, amazing fitting bra, they fit like they were made for me not to mention they look really awesome on. I got them in three colors and plan to get all of them in time as they are really affordable. I purchased them in 36DDD the cup is mesh with an extra soft inner layer for extra support, full cup but peekaboo at the same time wide side band for us who need it and most of us do.
The straps are a bit too long on me but nothing that can't be altered. (DEPEND ON THE BODY TYPE)
Thanks.",B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra but way too small,B0000ZFDD4
This brand consistently fits very well.,B0000ZFDD4
"Not as soft as other bras, but very cute.",B0000ZFDD4
This is my most comfortable and cute bra.,B0000ZFDD4
A very pretty bra-- but cups run a bit small go up one size in cup or frame.,B0000ZFDD4
My first time using an unlined bra and this one supports as much as any of my push ups. I love the way it feels and the band is generous. The color is a gorgeous red with pink lining.,B0000ZFDD4
Perfect fit and sexy to boot. An excellent purchase.,B0000ZFDD4
"I adore this bra! I bought it in two colors, black and hibiscus. They are both so pretty and fit perfectly. It's been a long time since I wore an unpadded bra but I love this and it fits my 34DD just perfectly. Plus they are cute as heck.",B0000ZFDD4
"No sized the same as US, made in China.",B0000ZFDD4
I like the styling and design but it does fit a bit smaller than expected.  It does stretch a bit but probably would have ordered a size up.  I will not return as it is able to be worn but could have used a bit more room.,B0000ZFDD4
"Band is tighter than usual, cups slightly larger than usual. Overall, very pretty bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"very pretty soft fabric,cup size as expected. too tight around rib cage but i had not bought this brand before so next time will go x1 full size up.",B0000ZFDD4
"Best bra ever. I remember buying a victoria secret one identical to this one for $36+ years ago and i loved it and couldn't find it anymore. It keeps boobs up and perky but separate so they're not squished together, best cleavage in my opinion. I'm a 38C/D I got a 38C and I love the way this bra fits.",B0000ZFDD4
Very comfy and cute. I like this bra a lot.,B0000ZFDD4
"Pros: very wide straps, 3 hooks in the back
Cons: unlined

I didn't realize it was unlined, which is the main reason I'm going to return it. It does fit fine though. I went with 32DDD.",B0000ZFDD4
This is the second bra I have ordered. It is hard to find larger cup bras that are sexy and not full coverage. This fit the bill and supports my DD girls just fine. I wish it came in all colors- all with the matching thong.,B0000ZFDD4
Not as supportive as I would like for everyday wear but a very pretty and comfortable bra! 36DDD here and it is nice to have a pretty bra that fits well!,B0000ZFDD4
Felt it was a bit smaller. Don't expect nipple coverage on this one. You can see headlights big time. Super sexy for bedroom wear.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is an interesting bra.  It's not a push up and it's not a minimizer.  It's not super supportive but it's actually quite comfortable.  It covers and it holds, which is hard to find.  It's just real unusual to have such a ""casual"" bra.  I really like it.  We will see how it stands up after a couple of washes.",B0000ZFDD4
Got it on right now. love it!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a beautiful bra, made very well. Unfortunately, it was just too big in the cup size. I was disappointed.",B0000ZFDD4
"I ordered this bra because it such a beautiful, classy bra. It is also made very well. Unfortunately, the cup size was too big and I ended up sending it back. Needless to say I was disappointed.",B0000ZFDD4
Sexy bra - haven't worn it yet but I love it!,B0000ZFDD4
Weird gapping in the front - wear 38dd- returning!,B0000ZFDD4
She looks awesome in it! She loves the fit and I love seeing it fit!,B0000ZFDD4
Wonderful bra! Great support without adding extra bulk. Size DD fits as expected and the band seems to run on size. The lace bunches a tad but I think it will lay out flat over time. Not really able to wear under anything too light as the wrinkles will show but it makes my breast look amazing so worth keeping for sure.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's a gorgeous bra, but there's not much give, so definitely get the bigger size if you're between sizes.",B0000ZFDD4
"36D is my normal size. It fits somewhat small, but the elastic begins to give in all bras eventually, so I'm keeping it.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is beautiful. It would have been perfect if the FIT was RIGHT. It fit too big, I usually wear a 32dd or 34dd depending on the bra, This bra as a 34dd fit me like a 38ddd. I suggest going at least 2 bra sizes down. I'm going to try a smaller size because I love the design.",B0000ZFDD4
"Ok so here is the deal... This bra is amazingly comfy. As in..bring with you on family tripa because you don't wanna go bra less around your mother in law even if you are in your pajamas comfy. As a chestier woman I find it difficult to gets bras that are both functional and comfy without the dreaded unaboob. I think of I were to purchase again I may go up a cup size for fuller coverage, but this fits very well. Now don't go expecting miracles though as this is unlined and unpadded. The bra will bring the girls up to a natural height, but won't do any push up, magic fluffing, or high impact support. Just routine support in comfort.",B0000ZFDD4
"I'm not typically one to post reviews on products but this one was needed. The fit is inaccurate, the under wire is flimsy, and the hold is weak. I have been having a very difficult time finding a bra that fits well and does its job and shall add this one to the list of disappointments.",B0000ZFDD4
returning for a b.tempt'd by wacoal womens ciao bella balconette bra.this bra has a odd large spot where my breast does not fill.i adjusted the bra several different ways and it was still there.otherwise the bra fit fine.wish it could of worked out.,B0000ZFDD4
sexy but wish it was more supportive.only wearing it at home or with dresses.,B0000ZFDD4
Fit very odd. Fabric itched and made my boobs look very strange. I am a 32DDD and after having my son they aren't firm like they use to be so I need for of a supportive bra.,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a 34b and it fit me perfectly. The cups do point a tiny bit in the middle at the seam that runs over the nipple but this isn't a bra I planned on wearing under anything other than flannels and heavier sweaters anyway so it doesn't matter to me. Straps are nice and sturdy, this bra feels nicely made and holy heck is it pretty. I recommend.",B0000ZFDD4
Excellent fit and very good quality,B0000ZFDD4
"The look is cute on, but very uncomfortable from straps and no actual support to breast",B0000ZFDD4
"the lace is very stiff and scratchy at the bottom, also it is lined so not see through, I returned it becasue I don't like to be uncomfortable and my hubby did not like the lining.",B0000ZFDD4
Band was way too tight!  Returned.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a lovely bra that gives me comfort throughout the day. Since it's made of nylon, the fabric doesn't chafe my breast/s so often.",B0000ZFDD4
"i want to start out by saying i have a horrible time finding a bra that actually fits me! and this one does. i am a 40DD, and i always spill out of bras but with this one...it fits perfectly!",B0000ZFDD4
Amazing! Totally in love with it! it fits so nicely and definitely worth the price. I am so pleased with the quality and comfort. I will be buying it again for sure!,B0000ZFDD4
Fit is wonderful..... Really Sexy!,B0000ZFDD4
"nice stretchy material and great fit, it looks very pretty.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love this bra, it's beautiful and looks great on. It is also great quality!",B0000ZFDD4
It is cute and comfortable but it runs a little big.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is so comfortable! However, despite fitting well, it has absolutely no support. The only time I can wear this is underneath something baggy because otherwise it looks like I'm practically not wearing a bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love, love, love this bra!  It's beautiful, comfortable and gives great support!  It's exactly what I was looking for!",B0000ZFDD4
"I was pleasantly surprised with this bra.  I've been buying Victoria secret bras since I can remember but feel like the quality has gone down and prices have gone up.  I started searching for new bras and came across this one.  I ordered two by accident but they are both great and I'm so excited to have found them.  They fit just as expected.  They are beautiful, comfortable and have great support.  I would definitely purchase more.",B0000ZFDD4
"My regular bra is a full bodied bra, so while it doesn't have push up padding, it does have *some* padding. I bought this bra in the same size, and this one sags like none other. I removed the tags so I can't return it. I guess I'll be donating it then...",B0000ZFDD4
"I actually measured this bra and then myself with a tape measure to make sure I hadn't ordered the wrong size. It was fully 9""' too short and I have worn the same size since 1990. Lame.",B0000ZFDD4
"Cups are a bit flimsy, so I'll have to do some alterations. Otherwise it's a pretty bra, with good support.",B0000ZFDD4
"Usually, I have a problem with finding decent coverage all the way around and back. I don't have to constantly adjust myself in this bra. The straps could adjust more instead of half way to make my chest sit a little higher but I'm so happy to not be adjusting myself all the time, that I don't even care about that part. I've already ordered two more.",B0000ZFDD4
Was a very pretty bra but didn't have much support.,B0000ZFDD4
"32 F..... Its so hard to find a Bra for my wife that fits good. This one fits and looks Amazing. She loves it. No Side Boob. I loved it, she loved it. We bought 4 more in Different Colors. All 5 Amazing.",B0000ZFDD4
"It is kind of push upy......fits great for the hard to fit, but does put every thing up and out!",B0000ZFDD4
I am disappointed that the wiring is already poking me on my side. I expect this to happen after SEVERAL washes but not in the first 2 weeks of owning. I will say the color and size are what was promised so that was good.,B0000ZFDD4
could have little better support-coverage for nipple show. otherwise one great bra,B0000ZFDD4
"In my defense, the regular 34D was a little small (side boob) so I got a 34DD and it's a little big for me, but I make it work anyway. The actual bra is really pretty though :)",B0000ZFDD4
"Very sexy, very comfortable, 'very pleased, will buy again",B0000ZFDD4
"I was surprised that the bra fits very well, as a 38DD, that's not always the case.  The straps a little scratchy on my skin, and not great for all day wear, but overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute bra to wear.",B0000ZFDD4
"the band is a little small but other than that it's ok. it does amazing things for my breasts, and I'm a 34DD so to find something for su pport is very hard. the lace is a little itchy, but I'm hoping after a few washings it won't be so bad.",B0000ZFDD4
"Bought sz 36c , it didn't fit properly,  breast hung out on the sides. Bought sz 38d  , fits perfect, looks , feels great. Very pretty,  soft lace,  sexy. order a sz up for a appealing look, sensational fit",B0000ZFDD4
"Excellent product, and basically phenominal for me for the price point, although I'd assume the fit would differ person to person.",B0000ZFDD4
"Size down in the band and maybe up in the cup size if you're on the cusp. The inner cup liner can make a line and give you muffin boob if the bra isn't sized perfectly right. Once you nail the sizing though, the fit is great - really holds you in and gives good separation.",B0000ZFDD4
Really pretty yet still very supportive without giving uniboob effect.,B0000ZFDD4
"The 42DD was a true fit.  The support was okay.  This is definitely a ""date night"" bra, not a wear all day/ to work bra.  The lace on the straps was very scratchy.  I'm hoping it softens after a washing or two.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great bra, fits well and looks pretty",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra. I wear a 38ddd and it fit me perfectly. Holds my girls up in place and looks very sexy. I'm going to order other colors right now.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love, love, love this bra. So comfortable, and very beautiful.",B0000ZFDD4
"As someone who is fairly large chested (36DD) I was nervous about there not being any support, but this bra has a great,strong under-wire and fits like a dream. Definitely would recommend, it looks great on and is pretty comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
"From reading  the reviews, I thought these bras might only look good on women with large breast due to no padding, but this bra looks great even on a cup B. I also thought the under wire would be uncomfortable, but I was totally wrong. I love this bra and I also love this brand. I was first introduced to this designer when I was shopping at Nordstrom. I really am a fan of these bras and will continue to buy them. They do make you feel sexy. I bought it in black and tan. They also make a great versatile strapless bra (check them out). You can use the the straps or remove them.",B0000ZFDD4
Love these bras they fit well. Great brand,B0000ZFDD4
Liked the bra but had to get a cup larger than my normal size,B0000ZFDD4
Awful. I read the reviews thinking this would be the perfect bra. I couldn't snap it on. Also doesn't have padding.,B0000ZFDD4
Bought this at a boutique and loved it so bought another one here sexy and comfortable I need more so I can where one every day haha,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits well in the band, but the cups are too generous to do anything for me. As I am in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy, I thought about keeping it until my milk comes in in the hopes that it would fit well then, but if it doesn't that would put me past the return window, so back it goes. Didn't have any objections to the fabric or cut or anything, except it's just not the right fit for my current bust!",B0000ZFDD4
"I have several square neck tops and it is difficult to find bras that don't show under these tops.  This bra is well cut, works great with my tops, and fits comfortably.",B0000ZFDD4
"The product is beautiful, but fits too small",B0000ZFDD4
"Really cute, little itchy at times.",B0000ZFDD4
"I loved this bra so much, I have just ordered more.  It fits perfectly.  Cup size just right.  It fits better than bras I have purchased in department stores.  Hope they keep making it!",B0000ZFDD4
"Thought it would be higher quality. Fits ok, little awkward where the bra straps meet the bra. Not the most comfortable thing, but pretty. Lace is kinda itchy. Wouldn't wear it all day long.",B0000ZFDD4
If it has no lining then it would be just the black lace. Unfortunately is has a beige lining that pinches at the top of the breast causing a dent. With this in mind it is also not a demi cup but more of a whole breast cover.,B0000ZFDD4
I may have gone up a cup size and didn't realize. I have a large bust and small ribs and back. The band fit perfect but the cups are small and not very supporting. Otherwise a nice bra very pretty and super soft lace.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's ok, but I am a bit disappointed. The straps cause the cups to pull in a bit at the sides, giving my breasts a somewhat odd shape in it. The band cuts in after several hours of wear. One of those bras that comes off as soon as I get home.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is so lovely but the 32DD fits a bit narrower than most felina bras. perhaps it is just the style.,B0000ZFDD4
"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this bra fit. Everything fits in and the wires create a nice separation in the middle which is hard to come across with most bras for larger chests.
I just wish they had made the straps so they would have an extra inch or so to be adjusted. They're fine now, but over time the straps tend to give out.",B0000ZFDD4
"Nice item.  This is probably my 6th Felina, over more than a decade, same style.  I keep coming back to it. They support are pretty and give good cleavage.  This bra is a staple in my wardrobe.",B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty but is itchy and not so comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
LOVE this bra. I am large busted and the underwires actually lay against my chest- which is very rare! comfortable and I recommend!,B0000ZFDD4
"Not a lot of support and a little itchy, but it's really pretty and fits well. (A little big if anything, but actually pretty right on.) Great for looks, not great for day to day.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have been having a HECK of a time finding bras that fit my 36 DDD top. Your choices are pretty much overweight granny or... commando. This bra is BEAUTIFUL, fits perfectly, and doesn't give me torpedo chest or five-inch straps. Truly, I've only had it on for five minutes but it is very comfortable, functional and GORGEOUS so far!

Thank god for Amazon :)",B0000ZFDD4
ordered a 34DD received a 36C (rolling eyes),B0000ZFDD4
i am 38C and the middle section of the front hits a little weird and hurts.  Maybe after a few washings this will be more comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a wonderful bra ! Functionality, style and sexiness all in one.",B0000ZFDD4
Nice. Really nice. Especially for the price...,B0000ZFDD4
It is so comfy but yet so sexy looking!,B0000ZFDD4
"Comfy, durable, attractive. Good fit.",B0000ZFDD4
"For sizing, I am a 32DD and that's what I ordered, though I find the underwire to be quite tight and would probably have opted for a 34 band size instead. The biggest con with this bra is how thick the underwire feels in the center, almost like it's pressing on my sternum. The lace is not exactly soft, but I don't find it to be particularly itchy, either. The cup size is basically perfect. I was worried about getting an unlined bra in DD, but the cups fit just as well as any other type of bra, so that's great.

As far as how it looks, it's really quite pretty! I got the city rose color and am very pleased. The detail on the straps and little bows are really cute, and the lace is lovely, especially how it lies straight across the ribcage. So, even though the fit isn't perfect, it looks so sexy it outweighs that complaint.",B0000ZFDD4
Doesn't fit like its suppose to,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this for the look of the straps and the fact that it was unlined. Fits exactly as expected and is super comfortable. If you are looking for something that is stylish and comfortable this is the bra for you. I love that the straps have a pattern to them, looks great under some of the new mesh and see through materials that make up the shoulders of all those new styles.",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits great!!!! Didn't take long to arrive, I was so excited that I had to try it on as soon as it came.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a good bra. My review of the Felina contour bra was less than satisfied. Not so here.

While the bra seems to run a tad small, it wasn't too small, and actually fit really well with the padding removed. If you can live without the padding (D cup really doesn't need it) then it's a great choice.

Good quality and nice style, that's what I expect from a Felina.",B0000ZFDD4
"Gentlemen, stop reading.

This is the perfect bra if you have lots of under-boob, or whatever they want to call it when a regular triangle-shaped bra cup is left kind of saggy and empty toward the top of the triangle even though the cup is nicely filled out. So if you have suffered as I have suffered, get this bra. It's pretty and feminine but still feels supportive. It'll shape your boobs differently/better than the regular triangle bra cup. Give it a try!",B0000ZFDD4
"I got a tad bit larger size than I normally do, just in case (bad experiences being maimed by rogue underwire), but I still have slight bruises on my side from the bra shifting and underwire rubbing against me roughly. Could be sizing error on my part.",B0000ZFDD4
Love this bra!  I'd been looking for something with a little more sex appeal than my usual functional T-shirt bra and couldn't stomach the $70+ price tag for comparable bras.  I'll be ordering another one in a different color.,B0000ZFDD4
Pretty bra...cup size fit great....but I wish I had ordered a size larger. Couldn't see myself wearing this bra all day as it is a bit itchy not sure the straps could be supportive over time (plus size full bust here) But nice peice to feel sexy in ;),B0000ZFDD4
"Quite comfortable but there's a gap at the top, cups too big.",B0000ZFDD4
Cups did not hold up well.  Just missed the cut-off to return,B0000ZFDD4
Its very cute and sexy it doesn't give much more lift/ support than you would have without a bra. I am a 38DDD and the cup fit perfectly. the straps are pretty itchy the first couple of days. and the strap that goes around you and clips in the back is pretty snug (but im sure it'll stretch over a few wears) I would prefer more lift and cleavage but my boyfriend says it looks sexy so i kept it. There is no padding at all. So if you want a sexy bra that gives lift extra cleavage and it padded this is not the bra for you. It is also a little fragile when it comes to tugging and shifting it around.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is actually a very pretty unlined bra, IF you adjust to their sizing.  This is sized for a full bust.  I'm not augmented or a super full breasted woman, but 32DD is my trusty size 90+% of the time.  Ex... Maidenform (or plunge styles in other brands), I often have to go up a cup.  Other brands like Penache, Felina, Fauve, Bali, Natori, Wacoal, Curvy Kate, Fantasie, etc...32DD is generally spot on, especially in the demi and half cup styles.  In this bra, I ordered a 32D, based on reviews.  It's a nice fit.  For someone who has implants or naturally full busted all around, your usual size should be fine.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love it, just wish it had a little more lift ;-)",B0000ZFDD4
"Great price , fast shipper ...as advertised .quality product .....  Thanks  . ..",B0000ZFDD4
"This is super comfy for a lacy bra. As with any lacy underwire, it'll start to rub after like 12 hours, but it's great until then.",B0000ZFDD4
Love this bra. It is very thin and still able to support large breasts.,B0000ZFDD4
"I absolutely love this bra. I keep buying more of them.  They fit perfect, no lining so they don't make you look bigger than you are, wide straps which work great on boatneck tops, and very sexy.  I have them in every color.",B0000ZFDD4
I think I would have kept it if the length around the body would have fit more like a 34. It's fit was more of a 36 and that was using the last row of hooks in. Other than that it was cute and sexy even for large breasted woman!,B0000ZFDD4
...not the most supportive bra. More of a lingerie item than an everyday bra.,B0000ZFDD4
"This was very small and it was very hard to bend over without my breasts falling out! I was leaning over one time to pick up parts that fell(at my job) and my breasts feel out, and I was getting all kinds of looks from the people around me! This stinks!",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra. It's perfect. Fits well, doesn't bunch anywhere, and surprisingly, the alabaster is pretty close to my skin tone. I'm naturally pale, and don't get a lot of sun (especially on my torso). This bra is made of ivory lace, with a nude lining that comes through a little bit. So, it blends very well. I can wear it under almost anything without it showing through. Might be a nice contrast on tan people, or subtle nude of pale folk!",B0000ZFDD4
I did read some review saying they band fit a little snug and it does. But the bra is beautiful when put on. If you're not used to the lace material it can take some getting used to. Please be aware that the bra is somewhat see thru. Will be purchasing again.,B0000ZFDD4
"Wires poke out too easily. Inner lining of bra gets ripped. I often have to sew it to repair where the wires stab out. Lovely bra, but impractical and runs a little small as well as being fragile as hell.",B0000ZFDD4
A bit uncomfortable for long term use but it's beautiful and sexy,B0000ZFDD4
"first of all, let me say, i'm victoria's secret girl, i had been buying their products for years, but i wanted to look for cheaper alternative. So i searched and read reviews, and decided to try. the result, i'll keep this bra and will wear on laundry days, but i'll pay for quality. This bra fits me ok, but has no support whatsoever. I'm 36DDD. It feels a but tight, but cup size is close enough. It's a bit too rough for a bra, i expected a more softer and durable product. I don't know how long it will last, but i rather buy one bra from VS then 3 of those.",B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra but it seems a little small in the cup size.,B0000ZFDD4
"If you often find that your bra fits perfectly except for a tiny bit of loose fabric on top, try this bra. It fits me so well and is quite comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this brand they make beautiful bras to big breast women.,B0000ZFDD4
"I got the size too big... I used ""modern sizing"" but that was a bad idea.",B0000ZFDD4
my wife loves it but yahoo so do I.,B0000ZFDD4
"I don't know how to explain the fit exactly other than to say when you bend over your boobs fall out.  The cup fabric is too loose at the top.  I have 3 of these in various sizes and they all do this.  I don't think they were made for women who are ""naturally gifted"" in this area.... if you're above a C I'd say keep shopping!",B0000ZFDD4
"Aside from being a beautifully designed, I am a true 34DDD and it fits wonderfully.
My mom purchased this for me as a gift and I couldn't me more happier with it. The girls are sitting where they're supposed to be now :)",B0000ZFDD4
Terrible fit. Not comfortable and the cup indents and looks so strange. No support and the straps are to long. It is deceiving in the photo. Bad quality bra. I'm sticking to Victorias Secret for my lingerie.,B0000ZFDD4
Just as great as everyone here said it would be. :),B0000ZFDD4
"Wow ladies. I mean, wow. Im 22 yrs old. I wear a 34DDD Ive had a problem with my girls since I got them! Lol & forget cute or sexy bras (or even the right size, without breaking the bank @ vickys) but this bra is amazing. It fits me to a tee I love love love it. Worth every penny!",B0000ZFDD4
One of the best fitting bras for my size.  Actually cute.  Not miles of fabric,B0000ZFDD4
"This is the most comfortable bra ever.  It is lined on the inside with a fine mesh, so you don't get scratched by the lace at all.  The profile is very, very flattering.

I'm 5'8"", 130 lbs, and I bought a 36 C.  I tried the D, but it was too large.  Then again, I might just be really bad at sizing bras.  That's also a distinct possibility.",B0000ZFDD4
Lovely look and quality is very good. Would definetly purchase more of this brand's merchandise.,B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is beautiful and looks very sexy on, I am a 36D so it is a little small so I would recommend going one size up. I would order from them again for sure, but I'll be getting a different size next time.",B0000ZFDD4
"it looks great but it is a little bit small, but i still love it",B0000ZFDD4
The strap is sewn on twisted.  Cannot be worn due to major discomfort.,B0000ZFDD4
"i bought these bras for my wife which can be a task at times, however, This item is a gem.  They look great and fit very well.  Highly recommend if you want a personal item she will flatter!",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is very pretty - the only thing I don't really like about the bra is that the straps are placed very far apart- and there is not a good range for how far you can tighten the straps so your breasts kind of are really...separated. There is no 'push in'  or 'centering' effect at all.

 Also, the straps are MUCH thicker than the picture relays.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is pretty. I love the nude lining. The only thing is that the lace does get itchy after a couple of hours of wearing it. I'll just be wearing it at night for my man.,B0000ZFDD4
"Very pretty, very sexy and comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this bra for the money. This fits like a bra twice the price. The wider band lends support.,B0000ZFDD4
Finally something fits right and breathable to wear. Thank you.,B0000ZFDD4
"I loved the feel of this bra! The only problem is that I feel like they run a bit small in the measurements, the cup size fit, but the band was a little too tight, I'm normally a 38D, but I ordered the 40D just to be on the safe side, and it was still tight and uncomfortable even on the last clasps. I would definitely buy it again, but the sizes are wildly inaccurate. I will be returning it asap.",B0000ZFDD4
"I purchased this bra because I purchased two others that fit just fine.  For some odd reason, the underwire ""magically"" came out of the bra when I washed it and I cannot figure out how to get the wire back in the stinkin' bra! I even had my sister attempt to find where the wire came out of the bra... What really annoys me off is the fact that there is no way to contact the seller about this! I think the manufacturer should repair this bra free of charge! IN any case, don't buy this one because it is too expensive for these types of problems!",B0000ZFDD4
Great fit and coverage for larger breasted women.  the straps don't fall down and there is enough support for a sexier looking bra like this.  highly recommend Felina if you need a fuller cup.,B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty and fits great.  I love the straps and the sheer lining.  I may have to buy additional colors!,B0000ZFDD4
Fits extremely strangely. The cups are very large but only in the upper half. So large that it makes no difference how tight you make the bands.,B0000ZFDD4
"Easily one of my favourite bras, simple and sexy, perfect if you're looking for a lace bra that compliments your melons (I'm a 32DDD/F) You won't regret purchasing this.",B0000ZFDD4
"I am always nervous about ordering clothing online because sizing is so different. But this bra is lovely, fits perfectly and is simply beautiful. It was difficult to determine if the bra was sheer, but it is actually lined with flesh colored fabric. Quite lovely.",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits like a VS bra, which I think runs a little smaller than others. It's made like the VS unlined demi. Seems to be made well. No complaints here.",B0000ZFDD4
I have 3 of these. I love how it holds on around my ribs n keeps everything in place.,B0000ZFDD4
I love it love it love it thank you,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is okay. I wear it on laundry days -- It could be my fault (maybe it's the wrong size?) but it's tight in the middle area, between the breasts (leaves marks) and fits nicely around the boobs. It can sometimes seem loose, but I believe that's just the style. It is quite uncomfortable around the middle breast area but fits on the sides. It makes each boob look like it has it's own cleavage line (separate but united?). It's a little hard to explain. When I wear the bra to work I usually regret it and it hurts a little too much to chill in. But overall, it is a bra.",B0000ZFDD4
The fit was super strange. The fabric and color were very nice but the fit was very odd. I returned.,B0000ZFDD4
Very scratchy fabric. Not great quality.,B0000ZFDD4
"This arrived before ETA which is always a nice touch.  I tried it on to determine if it would be itchy as some reviewers have said, but I had no issues.  My skin is very sensitive and so I put it to the test.  The fit is so comfortable.  I Iove the balconette style because it doesn't add too much exaggeration and seems to hold everything in place quite well.  The color is soft and nice as is the material.  The only drawback is that the material is on the thinner side so it is definitely a warm weather bra.",B0000ZFDD4
I first bought a 32ddd which is the size I was measure for the cup was too big so I reordered a 32dd and it fit perfectly so I ordered three more,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a size 40D but this bra was uncomfortably small, I'm returning it to get a 40DD size.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have found that the best fit for my unequal girls is an unlined demi or balconette, that this bra fits well.  I do wish it came in other bright colors!",B0000ZFDD4
so sad this didn't work. Much smaller than other Felina bra i own. Luckily i had a friend who could wear it.,B0000ZFDD4
Pretty and would have loved but cup was too big and could not exchange for smaller size as it was unavailable. It had potential. No idea if i would have liked if i could have gotten in a smaller cup. I do suspect it would have been a date night bra and not a every day for long hours,B0000ZFDD4
Is pretty but based on other reviews I sized up..should have stuck with my regular size.cups are large and actually a little strange even if they had been smaller.something on the design of this bra was just off for me. I also went up in band size.that can be controlled with the adjustable hooks so no issue there..lace was not scratchy and was pretty,B0000ZFDD4
The straps were to thin and the cups were way to big.  Sent it back.,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a 36 DDD/DDDD (E/F) depending on the bra. The band is perfect the straps are nice. I'm 4'10"" so I have to tighten them significantly. The lining in the cup is comfortable. The wires are nice and wide. The problem is the cups. They are just a tad too big. I could take them in a 1/4"" and this would be fine. But honestly, I'm not experienced with tailoring undergarments. I won't order a 36DD as I'm concerned that the wires will narrow too much and the cup will be too small. This is advertised as a demi cut but on me it's more like full coverage, the top of the cup comes almost to my collar bone and my shallow breasts just won't fill the top of the cup. I'm not too disappointed as I only paid $17 for the bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great BRA, overall. I am certain my husband would give it 5 stars on looks alone, as it looks great on my skin tone.

I ordered a 36DDD and while the band is not so small it needs an expander, it is rather tightly uncomfortable the longer you were it. Definitely more a ""date""-with-the-hubby type lingerie than comfortable to wear for more than 8 hours, unless you can get away with band size up, but this often creates the illusion of sagging, gaps, and backfat, so, not always the best idea.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love Felina bras!  They are perfect if you want to feel sexy and surprise your husband after work, as they are very discreet under work clothing.",B0000ZFDD4
My item came within 2 days.  When I tried on the bra it fit too high up on my chest area and was very uncomfortable!!!!!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is not what I expected. The thin shoulder straps dig into my shoulders and the lack of lining make the shoulder straps support all of the breast. This leaves the breast with an unnatural shape, like an indention in the breast. I will be returning this item.",B0000ZFDD4
A little stiffer than I would have liked. But because the waist does run slightly smaller it fit a bit snug in the underbust and under the arms. I am sure that also the stiffness contributed to that. But if you order a size up on the waist size and are looking for something sexy and not something to wear for support all day it is a super cute and sexy bra...,B0000ZFDD4
"Beautiful bra, and one if the most comfortable I've bought in a very long Tim.",B0000ZFDD4
"Haven't had the same issues with the black as I did with the white. The white one was very poor quality.  They both look amazing, this one has lasted longer though.",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits as expected, with a nice thick band.",B0000ZFDD4
"Just what the title says. I'm usually a 32DD/E but not in this bra. I will edit my review based on how/if I can exchange, and how the new size fits.",B0000ZFDD4
"It's so pretty and fits so well. It's wonderful. Fits under my clothing with no problem, doesn't bulge out or create any weird breast shapes. I love it.",B0000ZFDD4
It seems like all bras these days are geared toward implanted breasts that need a whole different kind of bra than natural girls.  This bra fits that need.  It is beautiful and sexy while giving support without hard cups.  Fits true to size.,B0000ZFDD4
i just tried it on and it itches already. the side cups are a little big on me. will likely return,B0000ZFDD4
"My wife said she love's the fit and is willing to buy more,thank you Felina for helping me find the correct bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"pretty, comfortable, fits well I love it you can wear it everyday - holds up well, can wash in the washer & hang dry or low dryer",B0000ZFDD4
Fit perfect and it was a good price for the size. It's hard to find bras the exact size I need so I was pleased when this bra fit as expected...,B0000ZFDD4
"No pinching and the cup sits well without awkward lines. I would recommend this for the sexy, robust lady. Great find.",B0000ZFDD4
"It was a little too big for me even though it was my usual size, so I ended up returning it.  It was good quality though and very pretty color.  I was looking for something with a bit more fabric to it but the unlined title should have warned me.  Overall, it's a pretty bra if you're looking for something unlined and no push up but does run a little big.",B0000ZFDD4
Fit exactly right.  Ordered my normal size.  Comfy and cute.  Would recommend.  Don't like having to write long reviews. Bye,B0000ZFDD4
I liked this bra from the beginning but it started to fall apart with the underwire coming out after washing it a few time. Had to purchase again but not the same style.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love this bra!!! SOOOOO comfortable!!!  So difficult to find this type of bra!  Will order more, later.  If you hate padding and can fill your cup, you will like it too.",B0000ZFDD4
"Money Well Spent
I must say that it is a Perfect Fit
Its Comfortable.
incredibility Sexy
No regrets with this perchase",B0000ZFDD4
"I really loved the look of this bra and was so hoping it would fit! However when I tried it on, the cups were simply too large. I'm not sure this is the fault of the bra, though; I suspect that it is simply not the best shape of style for my particular chest. If you have more top-heavy breasts this may work better for you than it did for me.",B0000ZFDD4
one of my clients always finds it hard to find the right bra ... so this was a good find the material she says is a bit thin ... so it doesn't offer much support .. bare that in mind !!!,B0000ZFDD4
The material is fresh and it fits perfectly. I like the way it looks and feels. I will recomned it,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this to match a pair of panties to make a sexy set, not for comfort. Boy was I surprised when this bra made it's way into my ""comfy bra"" drawer. I think I'll end up with four more of these. They made your girls look great, you feel sexy and it is surprisingly comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
"Band was a little loose on the first clasps, as were the cups. My major complaint is the fact that the straps are quite stiff when you first get this bra, and they like to rub the heck out of your armpit.

Very cute! would definitely go down a band size next time, but keep the same cup size.

Also, the periwinkle is a little more intense of a purple than is let on in this photo.",B0000ZFDD4
I bought the bra for my daughter. She is a curvy girl with slim torso. The bra fits perfect. The overall quality of the bra very good for one exemption. She complains that it a little bit itching in the front. But still she likes it.,B0000ZFDD4
"It is pretty and sexy.

I love the Felina brand... it is consistent. Once you know your size in Felina you can buy different styles same size and it will always fit.

Thanks
Sharon",B0000ZFDD4
"Uncomfortable and you can't tell from the picture but there is no lining or padding,  only lace over the cups.",B0000ZFDD4
"It came a little earlier than expected which was nice, however the fit was not at all like the picture, a little big and I have to wear a tank top to make things stay in place :/",B0000ZFDD4
"This is cute but it's scratchy in all the places you don't want it to be scratchy like the band and the straps. The straps have nude felt-like material for additional durability but I think this is what is part of the problem because the material used is cheap. Anyways, don't buy this one--go to the department store and find another cute one.",B0000ZFDD4
"The color is different and the detail on the straps is soooo feminine.
It seems to run a bit small in the back size.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a very pretty item and quite well-constructed. However the band runs a little small. The dark plum color is lovely and the straps are lacy and attractive without being itchy, and are lined in a plush flannely fabric. I will reorder this item.",B0000ZFDD4
"Felina makes some really great underwires, central gores, and band structures. Of the various brands of bras I have tried, Felina is the only one that creates bras that will perform to the standard that a good fitting bra should on me: stay on with the central gore flush with the breastbone, cups around the breasts, and underwires against the ribs under the breasts WITHOUT the straps on shoulders or band fastened. Seriously, the only brand. They seem to have the perfect structure for people with large, firm, dense, close-set breasts on a narrow frame. I've been fond of various Felina bras in the past. Unfortunately, the cup fabric does not quite perform quite as well. Felina bras tend to expect the vertical center line of your breasts to be farther toward your armpits than they are on me. This seems really odd to me given how well the underwires fit and lay flat. It causes some sagging at the top of the cups and any seaming or cup fabric structure to not line up properly with the breasts. This particular bra has the added drawback of having weird fabric. It's a stretchy mesh with either lace or stitching of some sort in a lace-like pattern. The mesh stretches and conforms to your breasts while the lacy detail prevents the fabric from moving and conforming. Unless you're toting basketballs around, this causes some weird indentation effects where the lacy detail is. Overall, the cons outweighed the pros for me.",B0000ZFDD4
I love it! It can be quite difficult to find cute bras in larger sizes that actually fit right. I am over the moon with this bra!,B0000ZFDD4
"Such a good bra! Looking for a non padded bra for a larger bust isn't easy, but this one fits great and the support is there. Comfortable and all natural :)",B0000ZFDD4
"I got a 32DD and it's tight. I normally wear a 32DDD though. Still looks good. But since it's unlined, it gets itchy after awhile.",B0000ZFDD4
"like other reviewers said, the bra straps are somewhat loose. i did adjust them and it was still too big. It didn't have enough support for me. pretty bra though, but i returned it because of the lack of support",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is really pretty and holds the big puppies firmly in place. Great quality and looks very sexy. I will be buying again,B0000ZFDD4
For a 34DD- this bra fits great- and it's comfy. love it so much im buying another--it's really sexy too,B0000ZFDD4
"So if you are among the overly blessed like myself (34DDD) then you will find that most pretty bras are just not for you. I like this one and even though I ordered the correct size I found myself sort of spilling out of the top ever so often, and really really spilling if I bent over at all. Just becareful maybe order a cup size larger for this particular design?",B0000ZFDD4
"When I first tried on this bra I loved it.  It fit perfectly, gave a smooth line down my back and great support.  I am size 34DD generally.  The straps did feel a bit harder than I would like.  By lunchtime I was compulsively wriggling in it as the elastic around the base of the bra was incredibly scratchy and irritating.  When i took it off and ran my fingers over it i discovered the stitching is done with really course thread and this was the source of my discomfort.  I am a bit sensitive to fabrics and will generally not buy a bra unless it has soft elastic, so it might not bother you.  I do also have to say the fit and look of the bra is fabulous.  I will wear this for outings rather than whole days at work though.  I also bought the Felina lush lace cheeky pany boyleg to match and these are really comfortable, flattering and pretty.",B0000ZFDD4
Fit great around but no support up top.  The lace was too loose at the cleavage area and I felt like I was moving around in it a lot....may try double sided tape to hold it hold it fits the dress I had in mind.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love the look of the bra and when I initially put it on it fit ok, but as the day progressed, I found myself spilling out.  If the cup was darted a little at the top, it would prevent the spillage.",B0000ZFDD4
"this is the perfect bra for those with larger breasts, very comfortable and NOT grandma looking.  It is very supportive.",B0000ZFDD4
the strap are not comfortable at all need to improve it looks great but I gave away the color is nice,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is amazing, it's supportive and super comfortable.  I'm a 36DDD (sometimes a 34) and this fits like a dream.  Also, it looks fantastic on, I will be ordering in more colors!!",B0000ZFDD4
"If you are buying this for a bigger cup size, the straps need to be tightened all the way and the cup stretches as the day goes on and ""the girls"" barely stay in",B0000ZFDD4
It fits good except there still loose space in the front but I love the fit definitely will order more,B0000ZFDD4
"So, why am I happy with this? It is a 36 B, and I pretty much fill it out. As others have mentioned, sheer bras are normally way too large in the cup, usually because they're stretchy. This is not stretchy through the cup, and I couldn't be happier. I'm built lanky: long arms and legs, broad shoulders, small boobs. This does not dig into me, and I don't find it to be itchy. This is working for me. I am so freaking glad it doesn't push my breasts together!!! All that does is make them look smaller, and, well....squished together. How that is supposed to help, I have no idea. Who ever thought that up? This allows them to sit a lot closer to where they want to sit (they tend to point outwards just a bit), however, it DOES GIVE SUPPORT. This is a small miracle. Hats off to Felina. And, thanks to all the previous reviewers whose comments clued me in as to how this would fit!",B0000ZFDD4
"Great usual Felina fit no surprises here. Has a nude colored lining under the lace, looks very nice. Good support, too.",B0000ZFDD4
Hate writing reviews but i like this bra. I love the way I look in this bra. Will order more in different colors.,B0000ZFDD4
The Whole thig was Huge I normally wear a size 38DDD so I figured I'd be fine with a 40DDD but the straps were huge! Even with them tightened all the way it's like they expected my boobs to be a lot closer to my belly button then my shoulders. I had to cut 5 inches off the straps and re-sew them to get it wearable and even then the fabric was so worthless that it did absolutely nothing other than make me not naked.,B0000ZFDD4
I wish the line was more readily available. Been buying Felina for many years. Bras wear very well and never lose fit.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love the design of this bra, but unfortunately they don't have it in my size.  My husband likes it though, so I'm keeping it even though I wear a 32 G bra.  I ordered a 34 around thinking it might fit a little better, but the cup is still much too small..  We like the soft cup though and it's a comfortable bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"I hate how this fits. The shape is off, the sides are too rigid (as the strap pulls up), but the front is too open and loose. Sending it back.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love the fit and style of this bra, the color is also neutral so good under light colors.
Would buy another.",B0000ZFDD4
"I usually wear 34DD but I do wear 32DDD/E in some cases (and in this case). The cups do not cover the entire breast area. From what was pictured, I didn't expect full coverage but this looks nice when put on initially but after 15 mins my boobs are spilling out from the top. The material is very delicate and doesn't appear to be long lasting. It is a very pretty and delicate looking bra but this is just not practical for someone with a larger chest.",B0000ZFDD4
"Couldn't find this brand in my size in the Mall where I live.  I was first introduced to this brand years ago at a large department store.  Glad I found some Felina styles here.  Fits well, though the straps could be a bit wider for the larger sizes.",B0000ZFDD4
Wow. It fits. I love the color and shape. I am excited to wear it. I have been battling with bras lately. Would definitely buy another. Style is very elegant. Doesnt level bulges under clothing.,B0000ZFDD4
Scratchy cheap material and the underwire left a scar on each side of my breast. I find it hard to believe that this is FELINA. Either the quality of Felina has dropped considerably or this is FAKE all together. Save your money!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is beautifully made and quite supportive. I'm large-busted (anywhere between a 32DDD and H, depending on brand/maker) and chose to try a 34DDD for this bra since cups run small on most brands that aren't specifically for large chests, and this item doesn't come larger than DDD. It turns out to be a little large in the cup, which almost never happens to me! But the support seems good and the bra is both delicate and sexy while still providing coverage. I'll be returning for a smaller size.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra!  It fits great and best of all it is really pretty and affordable which is really hard to find as you into larger cup sizes! (34ddd),B0000ZFDD4
"The cup comes JUST above the nipple... but barely.  I've always worn a 36DD in Felina so it's not that I ordered the wrong size. I believe that the bra is just cut particularly low which doesn't look good if you don't have the most remarkable round/perky breasts.  The bra itself is very pretty, however.",B0000ZFDD4
"I really like the style of the bra and the cup sizing.  It looks cute when it's properly fitted but the straps are a little long - I have to tighten them all the way and throughout the day the top part slips down so my boobs start popping outa little which is obviously uncomfortable.  It's still a good bra, I just wish the straps offered a little more support.",B0000ZFDD4
"If only they had them in my size! I am a 34 G, but decided to try the 34 DDD since they don't make this bra in my size. It is just incredibly beautiful- but, alas, it was too small, and I didn't want to have to go to a 36 inch band in order to make the DDD work for me.",B0000ZFDD4
"Nice looking bra. Super sexy, not itchy, boobs look amazing! I will be ordering more because it is so hard to find sexy bras in the larger sizes",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is very nice and good value for money. It fits perfectly, is very comfortable and rather sexy. But I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for those who like more relaxed style of life.",B0000ZFDD4
"Comfortable, but I definitely got a size too big, which is not good because since there is no padding or cups if it is too big it makes your boobs look saggy.",B0000ZFDD4
"I'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment, so this was definitely something different. Straps are nice and thick. Back band is wide. Front portion lays flat underneath bra instead of tilting up. Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might. Will not hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather'. Middle portion does tend to press into the chest. My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays.",B0000ZFDD4
"before I bought this bra, I was used to full cup bras that didn't offer me any comfort; I am between a size 34dd and 34ddd and I am full-busted. after doing a lot of research, I found that demi cup bras were mostly recommended for people with my issues. when I got the bra, it was significantly small in the cup region; I ordered a 34dd. the band could have done well with some elastic or something because it shows through my shirt. when I raise my arms up, the seam from the cups digs into my breasts and creates this odd look. I don't really wear it casually, but it helps under my nicer clothes.",B0000ZFDD4
"I found the band to be a little bit snug, but it otherwise fits pretty much as expected.  However, don't be fooled by the picture for this item.  Unless you have naturally perky breasts or you would actually wear a half size and size down, your breasts are not going to sit that high in the cup.  As with all demi bras, beware: any upper chest side boob fat you may have will be smushed into adorable little rolle, in a most unfortunate and highly visible manner.  Don't buy this bra if you are carrying 20lbs extra or more.  You will not be happy with the results.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is pretty but not quite as pretty as in the picture. For me, the cup is a little small and I am considering returning or exchanging for a larger size.  The band seems true to size.",B0000ZFDD4
I'm a 32DDD. I like the idea of this bra. It would fit really well if the cups weren't pressing my boobs out. It's too tight! So I would say it runs a cup size smaller. AHHHH it's so beautiful I wish it would fit :(,B0000ZFDD4
"all of the DD I bought have smaller than they should cup sizes when on...bummed. they are pretty. maybe once I lose more weight I'll lose some of that ""filler"" too lol",B0000ZFDD4
"I love the bra's design. The lace is nice and the straps have a very sexy detail. It fits a little small, but I'm dieting, so it will probably fit better in a couple of weeks (fingers crossed). It definitely gives a good lift and push, and who can't use a little of that, amirite ladies?",B0000ZFDD4
"I was so happy to find my size in an unlined demi bra. It fits perfectly , and the lace doesn't wrinkle up under my shirt.",B0000ZFDD4
It's when you wear it yourself that you appreciate how sensual it makes you look 9and feel about yourself). Will buy more,B0000ZFDD4
"The underwire is too high, after a few hours you feel it stabbing the middle of the chest. Otherwise pretty bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"i ordered a 34ddd, which are difficult to find in prettier bras, and it fits true to size.  i would definitely buy another felina bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"Their bras just fit me. I love how they look, I love how they fit. No gapping, bunching, and no popover up top :)",B0000ZFDD4
"I have trouble finding pretty bras in my size... big boobs skinny waist... This brand always has something cute, I ordered the black and the hot pink adorable!!! I love them , super flattering, great fit, and really pretty and girly! Only issue I have is the lace is very itchy after a while ... but aside from that I love them!",B0000ZFDD4
"Unfortunately, I ordered the incorrect (too large) size, so I really can't speak to it. I am not saying anything negative; the wrong size was my error. I returned the bra. If there were a way to choose NO STARS, that is what I would do.",B0000ZFDD4
Fits perfect and looks awesome. Very comfortable and husband approves. Will buy another one in a different color. Hope it lasts long.,B0000ZFDD4
"Perfect. Fits well and is comfortable. The fabric is flimsy, but it is very supportive while you are wearing it.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra so much. It doesn't give a strange shape to my chest like some unlined bras with underwire do. It's super comfortable and fit perfectly. I got it in City Rose, and it's more of a bright pink but I still love it. Planning on getting more in different colors.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great bra, super sexy. It doesn't give much support to DD cup but fits nice and it's perfect to use it with dresses.",B0000ZFDD4
the metal under wire jabs into my chest and if I knew this I would have never bought it. I would return no but I have wore it for to long. I don't want them to sell to someone else and have then get my tit sweat all over there's.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love demi bras now that I've been introduced to them.  I always thought that as a member of the big boobie club I need a ""full coverage"" bra, but I always had gaps and space at the tops of the cups with them.  With the demi bras, the shape more closely fits my actual boobs, and is much more flattering.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have 40dd breasts and it so hard to find a pretty bra that looks sexy, but still holds the girls in.
This is perfect as it is a mixture of balconette and demi so you get some cleavage without everything falling out like most of the plunge bras.. I went back and bought in it ivory as well! I a hooked.",B0000ZFDD4
I've been fitted recently so I know my size. This size is all wrong. I wish I could post a pic. It looks like the right size but it's like one extra inch of fabric was included around the boob area that I could literally fold over itself to show extra fabric that doesn't need to be on the bra to make it fit,B0000ZFDD4
"I am a triple D. I tried this bra, thinking it would be silky and smooth for long days at work. Wrong. Double d's are way too big, let alone my girls. See ya!",B0000ZFDD4
As a sissy it's so important to feel feminine when cross dressing. My breast inserts fit quite nicely into the cup. I love the pink color which is my favorite color!!! I love prancing around and feeling dainty in this bra!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"Finally, a cute bra in a larger cup size!  The only complaint I have is that the underwires tend to dig into my sides if I wear it for to long, but that means 18 plus hours.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have been having trouble for a long time finding a bra that fits nicely and looks nice! I have issues all the time with the ladies spilling out but I haven't had that issue at all with this one, it's nice and comfy (even for a bra with an underwire) and it looks so good! It separates nicely so I don't have a uniboob under my shirt, also even gives some good jiggle support. My boyfriend loves it too, I want to order more!",B0000ZFDD4
I love the unlined feel and it really fits perfectly! Better then any other bra I own. It's still super supportive but without the extra padding if you are larger chested and don't need it.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is lined. I'm not sure why it's listed as unlined - I thought the lace would be sheer but there is a thick nude colored lining. I don't think the pictures represent the actual bra well at all.
It's average in construction and is average looking, but certainly incorrectly advertised.",B0000ZFDD4
I got a 36ddd and it is perfect. It doesn't feel like I have anything on and it is so pretty!,B0000ZFDD4
"You will look super sexy in this bra!  It is comfortable to wear, as well.  The quality is great and you will love the way you look!!",B0000ZFDD4
fits great love the sexy lace of it and the size was perfect! so hard to find a 36 larger than D and this 36 DDD is Awesome. Have had it for some time now and its still holding up great.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra runs suuuuuper small.  Make sure you order up a cup and bands size.  If I had gotten a proper size, I may have had a better review :(",B0000ZFDD4
"Fabulous bra for those who have a fairly full bust but don't care for the ""harness"" (""full coverage"") feel. Has the one issue that all underwire has.. if you wear it too long (18 hours or more), it starts to feel like you are displacing ribs.. but that is because your ribs aren't made to take that kind of hard surface pressure for that kind of time. If you need to wear a bra of some kind 24/7.. get a ""soft"" bra for evenings at home, and sleeping.. this one is GREAT for daytime.. This thing will keep that cleavage UP and natural as it is gonna get with everyday support. No, you don't want to go jogging in it, but it isn't meant for that. AND its pretty! Just an extra added bonus!!",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra fit nothing like the Wacoal and Natori 32DDD bras I purchased from Nordstrom.  I won't say it was too large, or too small because that wouldn't be accurate.  It just wasn't *right*....",B0000ZFDD4
This bra was perfect! I normally am hesitant to order bras due to sizing and being disappointed but I must say I have no complaints. Not only is it a pretty bra but it lifts and gives the perfect hold. I ordered it in a black 34D and will order again in different colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"I got this in both the black and the ivory, and I love them both. When I first went to wear them, they were a little scratchy in the beginning, but they became more comfortable and now are my favorite sexy bras. The part I enjoy most is the straps with the ribbon detailing... if the straps peek out, they look so pretty!",B0000ZFDD4
"I gave this product 5 stars because it's a beautiful as it is comfortable.
It gives the support that I need with under-wires without the bulkiness of cushioning (that manufacturer's stubbornly put in all bras, regardless of the fact that a 40D is already bigger than most of us want anyway), it's comfortable to wear all day, and it's just transparent enough to drive my bf crazy with anticipation.
I'd definitely recommend this bra in the size I ordered, though I can't speak for the other sizes.",B0000ZFDD4
It's not itchy at all!! It has wide straps so it brings out the shoulders and it is quite comfy so I love it!!,B0000ZFDD4
"The Bra looks exactly as photgraphed. However, I was expecting a soft feel instead the fabric is very rough around the the underwire and even the cups. the straps are lined so they were ok. Couldn't wear this for more than a few hours. I donated it to Good Will",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is pretty, and I do love the ""bounce"" that a good balconette bra gives, but the straps on this bra stretched out almost immediately, resulting in me constantly pulling up fallen-down straps all day.

I wouldn't recommend this bra is you're a large-breasted woman.",B0000ZFDD4
"I like lace bras, but this one failed in a number of ways.
The lace doesn't stretch, and is VERY scratchy.
The underwire pokes.
The strap adjustments are difficult to reach because they're in the back, and only half of the strap stretches. The adjustment portion didn't adjust short enough for my small frame, so the straps were too loose.
This is an uncomfortable, poor-fitting, and hard-to-adjust bra.
The only thing good about it is that it's cute - but that's not enough!",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits Perfect!  I am fairly small but it fits like a glove.  Its comfortable sheer & sleek.  I highly recommend if you want something comfy, sheery & sleek.",B0000ZFDD4
"In the interest of helping others...I'm 5'6"" and 134 lbs (yeah, I know...working on it!). I'm a true 32DD in most brands. My ribcage actually measures at 31.5"".

First things first: this bra is beautiful, sexy, not the least bit trashy and I have been waiting for it to get marked down (THANKS AMAZON!!!). I purchased it in the black and its lovely. It has a lovely lace overlay and the cups are unlined. The seam you see in the pix is comfortable and doesn't telegraph through to a t-shirt/tank top.  The cups give a nice rounded shape and come up high enough to not have any quad-boob or spillage after I bend over to pick up a wiggly toddler. The straps seem to do a nice job of supporting my 'girls' without cutting into my shoulders. The back has three hooks. The band is soft/not itchy and seems slightly small. I LOVE that the underwire doesn't come up too high. It hits at a very comfortable spot on the sides. For some reason, where the underwire meets in the front REALLY pinches. I really want this bra to work so I'm exchanging it for a 34D in hopes that its sister size will be a GO. Fingers crossed!

UPDATE:
Ordered the 34D. THe band was more comfortable (perhaps slightly loose?) but the cups gapped on the top. I must be fuller on the bottom.  It made the girls point down and out. Very sad, indeed. Sending it back. It is beautiful...though. Maybe for someone else with a different shape.",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is gorgeous! I just had a breast augmentation and my DR wants me in an underwire bra with no lining or push up. I bought on size larger and it's doing the trick! Once my breasts settle and I'm able to really go bra shopping, I will be buying this bra again in my size and in multiple colors ;) the straps have a nice detail and the lace is sexy. It's a little itchy where the 2 wires touch my cleavage, but I'm hoping thats because its a little too big.",B0000ZFDD4
What a beautiful color and the fit is great.  I love to have a wide selection of color in my undies and this bra is beautiful.  The quality is excellent and the price was great.  I wear a 34DDD and am glad AMAZON carries all the things I desire.,B0000ZFDD4
"The lace is stiff and scratchy, the fit was not good for me. Overall, very uncomfortable - I'm returning it.",B0000ZFDD4
"Just way too much fabric for my tastes and big straps, 3 hook back. Not happy with it. Would not recommend.",B0000ZFDD4
"This fits wonderfully and is very flattering, definitely a great deal!  I will be ordering more soon, hopefully in different colors!",B0000ZFDD4
"These bras look as beautiful as they look in the picture shown.  However, they are cut a bit shorter at the top. Although not padded, because of  having strategically positioned seems one can wear them under T shirts and thin sweaters and not worry about revealing too much.",B0000ZFDD4
I found the bra to be very well made for the price. It was comfortable to wear and pretty to look at. Who could ask for more?,B0000ZFDD4
I would have given a five except I wish I knew the full figure runs big. Have others by them and they are well made and beautiful.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love the bra, fits nicely. Appreciate that it has 3 hooks, so good support without unnecessary 'contour' materials.  Thank you!",B0000ZFDD4
"The picture is small enough that I did not notice that the strap was not all black, I was very dissapointed. I can still wear it but I REALLY wanted an ALL black bra.",B0000ZFDD4
This is a good pick for a first time bra purchase online. I like the straps on the outside. I only hope it will last  for awhile.,B0000ZFDD4
"Liked the bra, it gives supports, I could where blouses that are wider on the shoulders but, it scratchs on the side arm pit a little bit.",B0000ZFDD4
"I really like this bra. The band was a little too tight for me but it's nothing a cheap bra extender can't help. Other than that, it's a sexy bra that I really like the look of.",B0000ZFDD4
34dd lilac bra. Super pretty  and feminine. I want to get all the other colors now. And yes it fits just fine.,B0000ZFDD4
I am a 34ddd and have a hard time fitting into pretty bras.  This one fits perfectly and is pretty:) just like the picture,B0000ZFDD4
"i'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs and this just didn't fit right.  Maybe it's made for a bustier women I guess",B0000ZFDD4
"The wires stabs me awful and is a smaller fit than a normal 34DD. It is very pretty, but that doesn't matter if I cannot wear the item.",B0000ZFDD4
"I am always leery of buying bras online, it is hard for me to find a bra that fits correctly, is comfortable and does what I want it to do even in stores. This bra does all three plus is very sexy! I am a 40 C and the size is perfect! I would recommend to anyone!",B0000ZFDD4
I love the color and the fit its kinda itchy but after you wash it a few times its perfect,B0000ZFDD4
"I just got this bra today and tried it on right away and I love it! I have a hard time finding the right cup size. I wear a 38 DDD. Victoria secret and Frederick of Holly Wood do not have my size so when I found the larger sizes on Amazon I was excited to buy one. This bra seemed really thin when I took it out of the bag but its beautiful and make my boobs really perky just like I was looking for. Grant it I have really full boobs, so it fills out the bra nicely. The bra is very comfortable as well. The only thing is the band is a little tight I wish I went a tad bit bigger on the band. I will definitely be buying another one!",B0000ZFDD4
"I originally purchased a 32DD, but when I received it was two small. I returned it the same day for a 32DDD. I'm not sure what size this corresponds with, but I wear a 32F.

It is the best fitting bra I've had in years.

I'm not sure about wear and tear, but I'm sure with hand washing it will definitely last a while.",B0000ZFDD4
"I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D  the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides.  The cups were just a TAD too big, and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that, being a 38, the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size....cup size was alright, but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide!  It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center!  No thanks!  Plus, it pushed really hard into my sternum!  The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable, I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is the second time I purchased a bra on Amazon and the sizing is not the same as the bra in store. I got fitted for Felina bras and was told that I am a 32DDD in their bras. When I tried the bra on in store, it fit perfectly so I decided to order on Amazon because the store price was way more expensive. This bra has so much space in the bust area that I cannot possibly wear it as the 'girls' will jiggle with any step that I make. Terrible!",B0000ZFDD4
but i liked it. it makes her chest looklike one of those marie antoinette women. we had to exchange for a larger size though.,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm leery of bras without shaping and structure these days, but this does the job without any of it.  Pretty, comfortable, and supportive.  I will buy this again.",B0000ZFDD4
"size-fits-lightweight, so ideal for summer. I do not feel comfortable from-zi coarse material, rubbing the skin. Perhaps after a few washings will be softer.",B0000ZFDD4
"Very pretty and well made for sure, however, the bra is very wide so not good for narrow backs. Straps cut into tenter skin near under arm area.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this brand of bras here at Her room.com/Amazon. This bra was priced under $20.00. I like the fit. I really like the style too! The material is nice. I had to go up in inches around to give me room for bloating. The cup size is accurate.,B0000ZFDD4
"Finally a sexy beautiful bra for a woman with bigger breasts that doesn't look like an iron lung. It's comfortable, gives plenty of support and doesn't have straps and a back that are the size of your wrists. Kudos Felina",B0000ZFDD4
"THIS BRA IS AMAZING.
FIVE STARS NO TEN WELL DESERVED. WHY?
BECAUSE I SAID SO LOL. JP.
HERE IS WHY.
ONE I HAVE BEAUTIFUL BIG BOOBS I WEAR A 2
36DDD & IT'S AS U KNOW SOOO HARD TO FIND A BRA...THAT FITS ME LET ALONE A HOT CLASSY ONE. SECOND THIS BRA GOES RETAIL FOR $130 GIVE OR TAKE. I KNOW CUZ I HAVE OWNED THIS BRA BEFORE AND I GOT THIS BRA FOR A STEAL.
THIRD IT'S SOFT AND CAN BE WORN TO WORK AS LINGERIE OR WITH C THRU SHIRTS OR SEXY DRESSES AND IT ALL LOOKS GOOD.  Versatile. Buy it today.

Bella D ",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits perfectly in the band but the cups are a strange shape. It would be too small for me at a 32DD, but the 32 DDD was just a tiny bit loose. I wish I could get it hemmed or something. It is a really pretty bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra looks lovely on. The strap design gives the effect of skin peeking through, & the shape it gives is surprisingly natural, I.e., more of a sloping, projected look as opposed to very round & boosted up. So that's either a plus or minus depending on your preference. But the straps are very thin & fairly rough on the sides; I found they cut in after more than a couple hours of wear.",B0000ZFDD4
Cute but a little itchy! Looks good for short term use. Size is accurate. Color is cream- very cute. Would buy again,B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra it's amazingly comfortable along with giving me a great lift. Cleavage looks amazing! Hubby likes it also ;-) its pretty. And been in the was many times and the wire is not coming out its not worn still looks great! I'm getting another one!,B0000ZFDD4
It's hard for you to find sexy natural looking bras when you are a DD. This one is super sexy. I ordered a cup size smaller since I was going for a sexier look and less coverage.,B0000ZFDD4
I was pleasantly surprised at this bra. I got it just for fun to wear but it is actually comfortable to wear for any occasion. but does run a bit small in the cup size if you like full coverage bras.,B0000ZFDD4
"The fit is terrible.  The narrow straps cut into my shoulders, but if they are loosened, the cups don't provide the proper amount of support.  You must be the exact right size to wear this bra...comfortably.",B0000ZFDD4
Very nice and sexy I ill by again I recommend this product confortable price is exelent  fit and material nice,B0000ZFDD4
Very sexy and functional. This product is also very reasonably priced. Great value and a great bra - thank you!,B0000ZFDD4
"I chose 3 stars b/c it is super pretty and I just love the look and feel of it. Unfortunately, it creates red marks on my skin on the sides of my body and is imprinted there for a while and sometimes in the center between the breasts. It is super comfy and I like it a lot but if I had the choice to buy it again, I probably wouldn't.",B0000ZFDD4
I have purchased this in another color before - this is a great item and the price was better than any department store in my area - I absolutely will buy again ..,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a pretty good bra, especially for the price.
But one this I have to say is it was not true to size.
Maybe this is because I have never owned a bra like this so I just didn't know that it runs bigger in size.
But the cup was a full size too big, the band on the other hand fit perfectly.
Otherwise I was satisfied.
Even thinking about giving it another go in a smaller size, it's not to expensive so if that doesn't work then what am I really losing right?
It's fairly comfortable, but a little itchy after a while.
But comfy to sleep in.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is very feminine! And very pretty.  Fits just right too.  I would definitely but it in more colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is gorgeous. Only problem I have with it is the size. I usually wear a 34 C, and this bra is uncomfortably tight. I don't know if it is cut wrong, or if it's just because the material isn't very stretchy.

I will be exchanging it for a 36. Hopefully that solves the problem.",B0000ZFDD4
"I wear a 38C Bra size, and this bra fits the bill!!! Love it!  I just ordered another one.  I would highly recommend this bra.  It is very sexy, and comfortable.

Update:

After wearing this bra for a day, it's NOT comfortable.  I would not recommend it all, and I have returned the other one that was ordered, and the one I kept goes in the ""Not form fitting, and comfortable"" draw.  I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead, so far it is very comfortable, and fits nicely to the breasts.  I will be ordering another pair!",B0000ZFDD4
I was surprised by the high quality and great fit of this bra for a really affordable price.  Lots of detailing not really shown in the photo.,B0000ZFDD4
"I write this review for the DDD's, this bra is pretty but no support for big bust, I guess that's what you get for the price!",B0000ZFDD4
"This stunning bra is every girl's dream bra. It has the right perks for any bra to have, from being comfortable to the adjustability. It can match the likes of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coobie-Strappy-V-Neck-Lace-Trim-Bras/dp/B008D2J9QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Bras</a>as this bra is like nothing else.",B0000ZFDD4
"There are many kind of bra out there, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coobie-Strappy-V-Neck-Lace-Trim-Bras/dp/B008D2J9QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Bras</a>; but then there is this item from Felina Women. This bra has both style and fabrics going for it.  You will disappointed from this item. I assure you.",B0000ZFDD4
"I am a true 32DD and this bra is very beautiful and true to size!  It is delicate, while still being supportive.  Great buy!",B0000ZFDD4
"The first thing every woman need is confort. If I could buy more, I would buy a dozen. Nobody would regret such purchase, so I really recommend this tem.",B0000ZFDD4
"Excellent quality, comfortable and very sexy. When buying was not sure because it seemed to have little support for people of large breasts, but besides having good support is very sexy.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra, very soft and comfortable.  I loved the feel of it, looks great, just needs a pad on the inside of the cup for concealment...of certain areas.  Other than that I have no complaints and I will be buying from this vendor again very soon!",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra! It is comfortable and fits very well. I plan to order more. It arrived much sooner than promised.,B0000ZFDD4
"I never write reviews, never, really. This bra was just great. I ordered a 34C and found it fit well. Stiff on the sides, but necessarily so as it is somewhat of a pushup/demi.",B0000ZFDD4
I love these bras. I've bought them in all different colors. The only thing that I can complain about is the fact that the underwire tears through the fabric. I've had to sew all of them. They're thin and comfortable. I'm quite busty with a small rib cage and it's hard for me to find bras that fit but these are my favorite.,B0000ZFDD4
"After I bought the Felina Helena (which I was completely in love with), I also bought this one because it came in more colors for my size. I wear a 32DD, and I often have trouble finding bras in my size that are still pretty and bras in my size where the cups aren't too far apart. This bra is just as great as the Helena. It is gorgeous, comfortable, and supportive with cups that are close together so that I'm not spilling out between them. If you are a smaller woman with a larger chest, this (as well as other Felina bras) should work very well for you.",B0000ZFDD4
"Online this Bra looks Delicious! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable. The problem?
I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old ""Felina|Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra.""
They, I, didn't feel comfortable, nor safe walking or playing around in it.  I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies, cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady!
YOu dig?",B0000ZFDD4
As soon as I put this bra on I never wanted to take it off!  I wear a 36DD and its hard to find a bra that makes me feel this hot & sexy and still be supportive and comfortable!!  I want it in every color now!! Love love love!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross.  This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night.  Also it fit kinda weird.  For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast.  (It was probably only noticable to me, but still, did not make me feel sexy.",B0000ZFDD4
"this bra is very supportive, and finally I feel sexy in it. it fits like a balconette, however keeps the girls up and in place",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to. They are a bit roomy, I'm disappointed.",B0000ZFDD4
Love this brand Felina makes the best bra for chesty women who do not want to wear granny bras. i have worn this style for years. Firm underwire give a great lift.,B0000ZFDD4
unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt. :(,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra fits, looks sexy, feels good and was just an all round wonderful find and good purchase.  Get one if you can.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a beautiful bra, but the support just is not there! I am a 34 DDD and I just didn't feel ""locked and loaded!""",B0000ZFDD4
"First let me say that this bra came in really fast, even though it was the holiday season! It was predicted to come in after 6 days at the earliest, but I got in only 4 days!

I ordered it in my size, 34DD, and even though it's an uncommon size, the bra fit perfectly. The band is snug all the way around and sits flush against even the front part of my chest. But there's still breathing room for me, too--exactly the way a bra should be. The cups on this one aren't molded, but they hold everything in place and nothing spills out or bulges. The material on the inside is fine, not scratchy or irritating. And of course, it looks cute on the outside, which makes things even better!",B0000ZFDD4
"I was so impressed when I tried on this bra.  I am a 36C, and this is sized just right.  It makes you feel sexy and pretty with the way it lifts and holds without squeezing- like the gentle touch from an adoring lover.  I totally recommend it!",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is cute and arrived quickly--unfortunately it runs a little small in the band size and is very uncomfortably scratchy due to the material used.,B0000ZFDD4
This is a good looking bra.  When Felina state it is for a full bust I get one cup size smaller than I would on other bras.  I recommend this product.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's comfortable and soft, but priced high compared to the duration of validity
Used only three times in the last time was outdated and very bad

I purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two years

Dislikes",B0000ZFDD4
"I would totally recommend this product. The fabric is soft. I was a little nervous about ordering a bra without having tried it on, but I was very pleasantly surprised when it not only fit perfectly, it is also very comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
"I did not like the seam placement in the cups....it vastly took away from the style.
The lace was very pretty though.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a great bra. Most Bra's at my size cause ""Double booby"" or lines mid boob leaving me in the ""Mom bra"" realm. This is a demi but with perfect support, and sexy!",B0000ZFDD4
"I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with. I did this because of the price and it was money wasted. The bras fit as if it had been worn. Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right. So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist. Useless. Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill. Bad purchase. Bad fit. Pretty but not practical. I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well, this was not made for D+ women.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long.  I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose.  I've probably only had that problem with 1% of all the bras I've ever bought, and sadly this was one of them.  The cups run generously sized (which for me, as a D/DD usually is a positive thing, but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down).  The overall design was cute, but the odd sizing made it a no-go.",B0000ZFDD4
"The material is super itchy and scratchy. The support is decent.  I wouldn't be able to wear this bra for an extended period of time.  Maybe just a short work day or something.  Kind of a let down. I was excited to get the bra after reading the reviews.  But this fell way, way short of my expectations. Oh well.",B0000ZFDD4
It is so hard to find a demi bra in 38DDD first of all. Second this fits amazing!! It is cute and so comfortable! The bottom does roll under a bit but not bad just if I am lounging on the couch and up and down alot. I am not sure how well its going to hold up over time (I don't think it's going to be more than a year) but totally worth the $$$$$ !!!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"I purchased my first couple Felina bras this past week. Previously I had been fitted at a department store and had tried on similar, yet different, bras from the Felina family. I decided on a whim to order them online. When they arrived I quickly tried to get the trying on portion over with. I can know say I am definitely a Felina bra fan! I am a 34D and for me the unlined versions gave good and comfortable support, while still being just sexy enough so you still get the feeling of being sexy because your undergarments are so pretty and you know you look good with them on. Highly recommend for women with cup sizes D and above because the fit is slightly big, made to be filled out. They arrived very quickly as well which was very nice.",B0000ZFDD4
"Wife loves the fit and full underwire support that lifts and separates her natural 36D frame.  I love the way she looks in them.  We bought grape, blue, and pink.  She likes them better than the hyped VS bras.  Comfortable enough to wear everyday, all day.  Bras have held up well to repeated washings.  Unlined cups so slightly minimizes bust.",B0000ZFDD4
"I do realize it's unlined, however the bra does not give any support at all. The color which I choose was beige, and I liked that wasn't just one shade of beige, but it had another hue of beige which made the bra pretty. If you want one with more support, don't purchase this one. This bra is good for just hanging around bra.",B0000ZFDD4
This is a great bra.  I love the way it makes a 34DD still look pretty and delicate.  Will definitely order again.  True to size.,B0000ZFDD4
"I almost liked this bra, but the straps won't shorten up enough. Even when I adjust them to their shortest they're much too long for me. This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking! Maybe I'm just built strangely, but I wasn't able to wear this bra. It is pretty though.",B0000ZFDD4
"The underwire fit well, but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive. I had to send them both back.",B0000ZFDD4
"I struggled with myself for a while before making this purchase. I didn't need a lilac colored lace bra. No one does. A bra, yes. A lace bra, certainly. White, nude or black -- all fine, practical colors. But lavender? What case can you make for beauty alone? I couldn't, other than that I loved the way it looked on the model and decided to chance that it might look pretty decent on yours truly. It did and does. The fit is excellent and it's well made and it LOOKS GORGEOUS. The color is deep but not too intense, a blurred, soft-focus lavender. GLAD, GLAD, GLAD. Indulge!",B0000ZFDD4
OMG I love this Bra its perfect and very Pretty!!!!! I will be ordering more of this bra but in different colors!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra, it is very comfortable and you can't beat the price for the support. The bra runs true to size I ordered a 32DD and love the long straps to allow adjustment. The back of the bra is nice and low so you can wear tank tops without showing your bra (like my Bali minimizer's do). I would recommend this bra especially for augmented breasts. Finding a bra for fake boobs is so difficult! Felina brand makes it easier!",B0000ZFDD4
"Quite flimsy. Doesnt give any support.
The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt.",B0000ZFDD4
I really wanted to like this. I put it on and looked great. I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already. Maybe be good for smaller chest but didn't work for my 36DD bust.,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this because I have a couple other Felina bras and they fit perfectly, this one runs a bit big. The wire in the middle goes up really far so I have to wear a higher cut shirt when wearing this bra. It's fairly comfortable though and has enough support for a 34D.",B0000ZFDD4
I am very pleased with the way my breasts sit in this bra: forward and lifted. Felina is the only brand I've found for myself and I use it almost exclusively. Recommend.,B0000ZFDD4
"My Boobs never looked so good, just the right sexy & playfulness... I love it!
It fits great and feels comfortable, I am very satisfied with the product.",B0000ZFDD4
Felina products fit very well and are very confortable to wear for the whole day. Do watch for new styles to come out from them.,B0000ZFDD4
This is the BEST bra I've purchased in a long time.  It's very comfortable; fits perfectly.  I've had several comments from other women about the beauty of the straps!  I plan to purchase another one soon.,B0000ZFDD4
"I don't think I've had a sexy bra since I left the C-cup range in early high school. As a 32DD, I can't even find a bra and when I do, it's usually disappointingly elderly looking. This bra is sexy and beautiful. The straps don't seem too wide like many made for the bigger busted gals. The only thing is I doubt it will be very supportive, as my breasts are sitting out further from my sternum than I'd like, which means there's a little too much room to giggle...but if you're not concerned about that, get it!",B0000ZFDD4
"comfort, support, separation, this one has it all. and it lasts too. This is my second one, and I wish I could make all my bras this model,  but I need some smooth ones, too. that's the only gripe. Lace doesn't work under every fabric",B0000ZFDD4
"It is not uncomfortable, but the cup are cut weird. There is more room for the top for you boob even though the bottom half fits normal.",B0000ZFDD4
"It's my 3rd bra from this brand. I really love it, fit perfectly",B0000ZFDD4
Im in love with this bra! I have used it for 10 years. It does the job and well.,B0000ZFDD4
"Wonderful bra! Ordered this Felina bra on a whim as I had never purchased one before. Turned out to be a very pretty and supportive bra (acts like a push-up, but with no padding). Very lacy and sexy look. I always order 36B and this fit with no problems. Cups are double layer fabric (satin inside and lace outside), front of strap has decorative design and does not stretch (but the back of the strap does). Side panel has no boning, but I get no rolling up on the side...so overall I am very happy with this bra.",B0000ZFDD4
sexy and fits perfect. im a 32 ddd,B0000ZFDD4
Pretty. Comfortable. Decent support for a lace bra and I wear a 32 DD. Well made. Only bought in a nude color and going back for a black and white!,B0000ZFDD4
"In my photos:  my hand is showing what it could look like if the straps adjusted tighter or if I can get this professionally altered.  In the other I am wearing the bra with a sheer work style shirt.

This bra is similar to VS unlined Demi bras. VS doesnt make my size and I cant fit their version of the 38DDD unlined Demi.  Im normally a 38DDD/38F and the 38DDD cup size fit well.

The downsides of this bra: The straps are only partially adjustable not offering enough support to lift.  The straps are also oddly wide set.",B0000ZFDD4
The size and shape of the bra was completely off. I would not recommend buying this bra. Quality of the fabric was cheap and only last 4 times before ripping.,B0000ZFDD4
Nice bra.  Good quality.  Glad to have it.,B0000ZFDD4
"the fit seems to be off. I am a very petite woman who wears size 30ddd, i usually can fit into a 32dd but the cups were way too roomy. Im going to re-order a size down to 32c because i would like a snug fit.",B0000ZFDD4
Very nice bra. Fit true to size. Would have given 5 stars but lace at center bunches a bit. Overall very good and pleased. Will be ordering in other colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"I have bought 3 styles of Felina in 38 D, too tight in the chest and 40 D, too big in the cup and they all fit differently. I am now about to try 40 C in this one. My previous styles were exactly right but no longer are made. I still wear a bright turquoise lace bra I bought 13 years ago and the color hasn't even faded. Other than sizing this bra has a great curvy, not pointy, silhouette and is so comfortable. The underwire is small enough not to dig in.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great, comfortable and beautiful bra. I have had it for a year now and they are still in great condition after biweekly washes. They are comfortable enough for daily wear and sexy enough to dress up with a thong and thigh highs. I ended up purchasing many different colors. They are true to size. Great buy!",B0000ZFDD4
Not having seen Felina in many years I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Amazon.  Nice construction and great fit.,B0000ZFDD4
"Not only is it beautiful, but it's so well crafted!",B0000ZFDD4
The only bra I will wear! Comfy and beautiful and wearable for a long time.,B0000ZFDD4
"Lace was kinda itchy, band felt tighter than expected; hoping it will loosen up after a few wears.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love Felina's sizing.  First time in my life a bra fits like it should!  And they are so pretty!  Impossible to find such pretty bras in my local dept stores. At least where I go. They are pretty fragile tho  I hand wash mine. Hang dry.  And I'm not sure how much support they would provide to someone else.  If you have a lot of sag, it MIGHT not be right for you, but for me it works perfectly.",B0000ZFDD4
"MY FAVORITE BRA! I wear a 36DD and it fits perfectly, is comfortable, sexy and affordable. Can't believe I can order a bra that will reliably fit online!",B0000ZFDD4
"Liked it, but ordered the wrong size.",B0000ZFDD4
The bra is nice looking which is why I gave it 2 stars but the material is really flimsy & it didn't fit well. It was loose at the top of the cup. Like not a lot or anything. Just no support. I am sending it back bc while I could live with that I can't deal with wire in the middle stabbing me in my chest. It goes too high in the middle & there are wires all the way up so I bent over & into my chest it went. Just not a great fit or thought to it.,B0000ZFDD4
Cut bra but it is very uncomfortable and did not shap my 36dd breast they way a good bra should.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra (34 C) is well crafted and very pretty. Looks and fits me just like the photo shows. It is not a stretchy lace, so very supportive, but unlike the Delimira full coverage lace bra, this bra can not be used for nursing/breastfeeding. The Delimira bra has stretchy lace, and the top edge is sewn in a way that it also stretches, allowing it to be pulled down to nurse. I was hoping this bra would work out for that, but I returned because it will not. When I am no longer nursing, I will definitely buy this bra again!",B0000ZFDD4
"it is the most beautiful bra
the drawback is that it does not hold the breast well
also if you are willing to hand wash it will not last long",B0000ZFDD4
Love this bra so much i ordered three more. It's so hard to find an inexpensive bra that actually fits well.,B0000ZFDD4
Very soft and comfortable. Fits as expected.,B0000ZFDD4
"Great bra. Very supportive for being unlined. Very pretty too. Not the most comfortable, but not bad at all.",B0000ZFDD4
...and easier access to myself with the lace.,B0000ZFDD4
Really pretty but runs a bit small. The 36 fits like 34,B0000ZFDD4
I bought the size I typically do with other brands. My advice is to go down a cup. The lace is just ok quality-wise and feels scratchy. After half an hour of wearing this I changed into another bra because it felt abrasive against my skin.,B0000ZFDD4
"I have implants 34dd and unless i bought VS no bra could fit right, small cups in most cases.  I found this brand in C21 but now I'm gonna shop here!!",B0000ZFDD4
"I suggest sizing down on the band, the material is very stretchy. Cups fit well, material is nice.",B0000ZFDD4
"Really pretty but the cups are a bit weird. Makes the girls a bit wonky and skewed.
Much like there's a search party going on at my elbows and the ladies are trying to help search too.
A definite ""what the heck"" moment.
I'm giving 3 stars bc the rest of the bra is well made and it's  (again) really pretty.",B0000ZFDD4
"So pretty and fits perfectly. Was worried about buying online, but it's beautiful, comfortable and supports without padding.",B0000ZFDD4
"Was a bit bigger and the inside lining also started to come undone after 1 wash. I might have needed a cup size down, on the size but after the wash I don't think I would order another.",B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty really liked it. There is absolutely no padding just lace and a really thin liner which defeats the purpose of wearing a bra. I have to insert some padding from sports bras or else my niples just poke right through it.,B0000ZFDD4
It's really pretty but way too big for me and I bought it in the size I currently wear??,B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra. Gives plenty of support, yet it is comfortable. Also, it is very sexy.",B0000ZFDD4
"Helps my back pain. Holds the waight of 34DD purfectley! Looks great,feels amazing",B0000ZFDD4
"I am well pleased!!!!fits perfectly! !I bought 32dd, very hard to find",B0000ZFDD4
Well made but not made for large bust,B0000ZFDD4
Not exactly sure what is wrong with this bra.  May be the right size but makes my girls sag really bad.  I had the nerve to order two of them so one is not opened and I waited too late to return so a total waste of money being that I will never wear it and I don't know anyone else my size to give it too. Bummer.,B0000ZFDD4
Very beautiful bra but it runs on the small side.,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits nice with good lift , materials are nice also. I would of given 5 star but I ordered a DD just a tad small .",B0000ZFDD4
Wasn't exactly what I expected.,B0000ZFDD4
Perfect fit! Nice full coverage. Will buy more.,B0000ZFDD4
"Bought the alabaster color in my size, the 32DDD, and it fit good. I felt like the top of the bra cups were a little too loose and needed to be cinched in towards the middle where the underwire meets above breast bone but maybe it's me and not the bra. It's super sexy and my husband really liked it. It was see through some but that's ok. Will probably buy other colors.",B0000ZFDD4
True to size. I'm between a C and D cup so I always go with D. Fits perfect. It has no padding. Just lined with a sheer mesh type fabric. Very pretty. I will be purchasing more in different colors.,B0000ZFDD4
I ordered a 36D and it fits perfectly. The quality is good and fair for the price and it is a pretty bra! I am happy with it.,B0000ZFDD4
Love this one - the fit and feel - ordered another one!,B0000ZFDD4
I wear DDD and this is the firts bra that looks sexy and is able to hold up my girls. My husband lives it too. Will buy more.,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits and looks great. I'm not sure how durable it's going to be, but so far I'm pleased with it.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra, fits really nice and it's extremely comfy. I will definitely more just like it !!",B0000ZFDD4
it was too small and didn't fit her well,B0000ZFDD4
First day wearing this bra was a bit uncomfortable - the underwire was digging a bit and the straps were a little tight. But after wearing it in a bit I can say that it is definitely the best bra I've worn in a long time. Very supportive and comfortable. I can't wait to stock up on all the colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits very well.  The cups are deep enough that I don't spill out of the top, which is hard to find for me.  Although the straps are narrow, the band is wide enough and supportive enough that it is comfortable to wear all day. I wear a 32 DD or DDD.",B0000ZFDD4
"Awful, way too tight and unflattering. Hopefully returning soon.",B0000ZFDD4
This is the most comfortable sexy bra I own - I have it in several colors...........love this bra. I am a 34DDD - so anyone can wear this bra and enjoy this lacy number.,B0000ZFDD4
I bought and returned two bras before i bought the third one. I am too tired to make another trip to the post office to return it. The sizing is not correct and the fitting is terrible. I will not recommend anyone else to buy this.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is one gorgeous and sexy bra! I love Felina. The color 'Bermuda' is much prettier than in the picture. The fit is great. I usually wear a 32DDD, but in this bra I actually had to size down to a 32DD. Usually most bras are too small in the cup, but Felina seems to be generous, which I appreciate. This bra provides good support and though it will show through most clothing B/C of the seams and being it is lace, it is a really pretty bra and would be fine under thicker sweaters. (I also bought the matching thong in a medium, and it fits very well also. I weigh 114. Very happy w/ both and will def continue to purchase Felina lingerie.)",B0000ZFDD4
Poor quality of material. I returned it.,B0000ZFDD4
"It fit good, everything inside, nothing falling out at the top or sides. But I would of preferred if I could of adjusted the strap length... shortened it a lil'.",B0000ZFDD4
first wear it came appart. not happy at all,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra; my size changed and I had to return.  But bra was beautiful and perfect.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love the lift and shaping, just a bit small on the cup size but still fits ok.",B0000ZFDD4
"It fell apart after only a month, sizing was off too. It fell apart after only a month, sizing was off too.",B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a 40DD US, 40E UK. I read the reviews before buyng. The material is great, this is a semi transparent bra with a light lining. Good fit in the cups, underwire and straps. I adjusted straps to lengthen them and they stayed on my shoulders. Minor gap at top cup border, not really due to too large a cup. Adjusting my breast eliminated most of it. Continue reading for the rest.

Underwire fit me fine, tight to athe sternum. I could have bent it slightly to ease that. Problem was the straps. They were a good length and I had to lengthen them, but they bear too mich weight from the cups. So between my collarbone and the top of cup, they never touched my chest, did not lay flat because of weight from the cups. Moving them in a little closer to neck caused more gap at top of cup.

The band is true to fit and the back lay just as it should. However, at the bottom of the center gore the lining is not attached to the lace. Both the lining tbere, and the band tend to roll up there.

If your breasts have more volume on top, aren't that heavy, and are not close together, this bra may work for you. If not for the straps not laying on my chest in front, I would have kept it.",B0000ZFDD4
"very nice bra, my size is 34D & I thought the fit was nice, however the material is a bit itchy. For the price I was satisfied.",B0000ZFDD4
"Kind of itchy, but fits comfortably",B0000ZFDD4
"fits well and isn't stifleing in padding, sexy and a brighter red then in the picture",B0000ZFDD4
"very nice, pretty lacy bra. no complaints at all! yay!",B0000ZFDD4
"i love them they fit so perfect, and very good material. i will buy some more",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is not only lovely but fits very well.,B0000ZFDD4
I am 34 D and it fits great and it's really comfortable. But most of all its so pretty.,B0000ZFDD4
"Somewhat itchy lace; but otherwise fits as expected (if not a tiny bit small). Not for everyday wear, though as there is not a ton of coverage.",B0000ZFDD4
"I really love the look of this bra! It is really very beautifully and intricately detailed. I  usually wear a 38DD, but ordered a 38DDD. Unfortunately, had I had ordered my regular size, this bra would be really tight and very uncomfortable, however, considering the larger size, this bra fits nicely. The band stretches nicely, the straps are largely adjustable and the cups offer modest coverage with out those annoying ""hangover lines"" . I am built a little heavier and have a large chest, I felt like the ""normal"" bra material really emphasized my bust size with all of the extra padding. The lace material allows me to dress modestly and not feel like my chest is the first thing noticed. The material tends to get a little itchy when worn for longer periods of time, but its not at all unbearable. I love the nude alabaster color, it blends nicely under most any colored top besides white.",B0000ZFDD4
Horrible! Bra was fine for the first couple wears but the cups do not hold their shape and look all stretched out and saggy!!! I would not buy again. Waste of $,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra.. Just did not fit,B0000ZFDD4
"I don't understand where all of the negative reviews are coming from; I haven't taken it off since I put it on!

The fit is great and it is supportive.. I purchased the black/nude shade and I swear I had bought the exact same bra from vicky's secrets years ago.. it is a dead ringer for one I used to have a long time ago..

Anyway, I am 38DD and that is what I ordered.. There are no problems with the fit; I find it is perfectly true to size.. The material is not itchy, the cut is supportive and the lace is sexy (though, I do have a thing for black lace..)

What more can one expect from a moderately priced bra? I can see this lasting me for years with proper care.. I love it!",B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra ...Have at least six ...Comfortable and washes well .,B0000ZFDD4
Bought this same brand in three sizes 34ddd 36ddd 38ddd in two colors. Never the right fit. Never the same fit in different colors. Horrible.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's a beautiful bra. Very sexy. My husband was very appreciative.  I read in some reviews that the material was itchy and scratchy, but I didn't have that problem. I just hand washed it before wearing, and it worked fine.",B0000ZFDD4
"Let me start by saying that even with 38DDD breasts, this bra *nearly* feels like you're wearing nothing. Of course, no bra is perfect, and any way you cut it, you're still strapping metal and lace to your body in an attempt to lift, separate, and otherwise wrangle a few hefty handfuls of fat, so there will be some discomfort.

PROS:
- No side ""boning."" You know--that absolutely infuriating two-inch long piece of pokey plastic that most bras have, that can only be assumed is a half-assed attempt at controlling your side fat? That doohickey is 100% the worst. I usually cut it out of bras, because within about an hour of wearing a new bra, that side-boob contraption becomes a barbed wire fence, rolling at the hems and poking you incessantly. You know what I'm talking about. No side boning in this one. Thank the heavens.
- The shape is nice and natural, with enough lift to get the job done. I've avoided unlined bras for years, after an annoying Cleo experience (nobody wants triangle-shaped boobs, amirite? So why do they keep making bras that make our boobs look like triangles?? This bra does not do that).
- It feels absolutely divine. Really, it just feels like wearing nothing at all.
- NO UGLY CONTRAST LACE! I'm so sick of extended-sized bras with weird shiny lace all over the place. I wanted something understated but sexy, and I think this delivers.

CONS:
- The straps... I love that this bra doesn't have gigantic, inch-wide straps. These ones are actually kind of pretty! I wouldn't be ashamed if they showed a little bit with a sleeveless top or something. But the scalloped edges aren't super comfortable. And, admittedly, wide straps exist to lighten your load, so these thin (but pretty!) straps are making this bra slightly uncomfortable. I can deal with it, though.
- The sizing isn't consistent with the other Felina bra I have, to the point where I really probably *shouldn't* be wearing this bra. My other Felina is a 38DDD and fits like a glove. It's supportive and (somewhat) comfy (Oy, the side boning). I figured this bra would be nearly identical, but it isn't. The band is much too large (fails the 2-finger test, even on the tightest setting), and the cups are the teensiest bit baggy. Obviously baggy is better, aesthetically, than muffintop, but baggy isn't great in the long run when it comes to protecting your spine. So that's annoying.

With the above concerns in mind, my first thought was to size down and get a 36G (which is what I wear in nearly every other brand of bras), but--alas!--this model of Felina doesn't offer that size. Really unfortunate. That said, this bra is super comfy, and the price was right, so I'll be keeping it in the size it is. I just won't wear it on days I know I'll need a ton of support.

Would buy again, but only if Felina increases their sizing.",B0000ZFDD4
The pink bra looked very cheap and it didn't last a year.  The right under wire came out and it fits a little loose.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's very pretty and comfortable for an underwire bra. I hate padding in bras but I have big boobs, so I kind of need the underwire. I wore this bra almost exclusively for the entire summer, and hand washed it only, and it has held up well.",B0000ZFDD4
So sorry - had to return these bras - unfortunately they don't fit my body style. My error.  I am sure others love this bra.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is terribley uncomfortable. The straps dig into my shoulders and leave impressions and soreness. It's pretty, but I'll never wear it for longer than an hour again.",B0000ZFDD4
Very cute but not comfortable to wear all day.,B0000ZFDD4
"I tried this bra for the first time and I FINALLY found a bra for bigger boobs that actually supports and lifts while still offering a sexy feminine look for the bigger boob women! Having big boobs, it's hard finding bras that support AND look sexy. I usually have to buy bras that window washers could use as holsters! Ugly, tight elastic bras. I've already a variety of colors. Women with double d's, you will love these bras, and so will your men!",B0000ZFDD4
"I originally purchased this in my measured size but it was slightly too big so I returned to size down and the fit was perfect.  The material is soft even though it's lace and it's very feminine while still providing ample support.  I am going to order this in more colors now that I am finally wearing the right size!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",B0000ZFDD4
A little snug on the band. I use 32/34. Bought a 34 and fits a little tight. And the cup is Demi. So if you need it to cover more of the top part gert one size bigger,B0000ZFDD4
I am in love with this Bra!!! It fits perfectly and does the sexy lift and separate...I plan to order all of the colors:),B0000ZFDD4
"The cup sizes run quite large.  In a Wacoal I wear a ""C""; this one the wire nearly killed me so I took them out.  Now I have a comfortable flappy bra:)  I'd say go down a cup size.  You'll have to be the judge, though.",B0000ZFDD4
Adorable bra but didn't last long.,B0000ZFDD4
not very good quality - you get what you pay for,B0000ZFDD4
"I used to work at VS, but I simply can't afford their bras right now. I'm a 36D in Victorias Secret & this fit true to size. I actually measure at 35, so the lace is great because it's a little tighter than other materials. Great support, nice and thin materials for summer comfort, sexy lace, and sturdy straps. I'm including some pix. In one of them I'm demonstrating with my fingers how opaque the thin piece of nude material behind the lace is for modesty. One finger is completely behind both layers, the other is behind the lace only, & the other is on top. I don't think this would be a good bra for smaller frames & sizes. 32C & up. Hope this helps & that my photos are helpful for the fit & not offensive.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love it, it really enhances the girls and being a trans girl that's important",B0000ZFDD4
Better bra for someone who has small bust.,B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty but not as supportive as I'd like.,B0000ZFDD4
This bra is cut weird cause it make your boobs push out pointy and the material sags and pinches oddly. The color is exactly as shown on here though. Not see through maybe if your white and dark nipples it may be see through but I am literally Light brown skin so nothing about this bra is see through,B0000ZFDD4
"Even though this doesn't quite fit as perfectly as I'd like... it's still one of my favorite bras right now. Very cute and rather comfortable, even for a fuller figure. I may try a different size to see if I can get a better fit.",B0000ZFDD4
"First of all, this is not a padded bra but I'd does have enough lining to cover. It looks smooth under t-shirts if you get the right fit. I should have ordered exactly according to the size chart, but I read reviews that said order a size up on the band, and that was a mistake. I measured 34 in the band and the 34 fits perfectly. If you go by the size chart for inches between band size and fullest part of bust measurement, you will get the correct size, too. This may be VERY different from the size you have been wearing! For me, every time I have been fitted they have said I was 36 and DDD but the cups always gapped and puckered, well since I followed the chart recommendations this one fits like a glove. I ordered a 36DDD and a 34DDD the 36 gaped just like my old bras, but the 34 did not. I've learned from this experience that the band fit is just as important as the cup size. Also, some reviews said the material was scratchy or not great quality. All of the ones I have ( I now have 4) feel great and are as well made as any bras I have ever had. I hope this helps others get the correct fit, because I am so pleased with the way this looks, very flattering and sexy, not at all like the lady bras you get when you order ""plus"" size bras. I'm do glad to find a bra that fits my size and looks good too. I'm going to order a good supply because you know how hard it is to find a bra that fits-and then they change or discontinue it!",B0000ZFDD4
"The first day I wore this bra I was impressed by how comfortable it was.  The support was great.  The next time I wore it I felt the underwire poking me.  When I took it off, I found that the underwire is not secure.  It shifts.  I was able to move it back into place but it doesnt stay there.  Very disappointing.",B0000ZFDD4
Perfect bra. Pretty and fits well.,B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra. Im a 38 DDD and its beautiful,B0000ZFDD4
Strange cup size made for lumpy boobs.,B0000ZFDD4
Fits perfect. Hard to find a good comfortable fit for big boobs.,B0000ZFDD4
The adjustment is limited so I couldn't really adjust to the right fit.,B0000ZFDD4
"The lace provides very little support, but it's still a cute bra.",B0000ZFDD4
Bought the 34DDD fits like a dream! At last an affordable cute bra in my size,B0000ZFDD4
I love it! It looks great on I just had a breast lift and implants and I just wanted something while I'm still healing to give just a little support and I'm gonna order another. Very happy,B0000ZFDD4
"The most comfortable unlined bra I own aside from Victoria's Secret. It's fit was a little big along the top part of the sides near the arm pit, but that just as easily could be from body uniqueness. The lace is beatifil and has lasted quite a few washes already.",B0000ZFDD4
Way too small and almost no support,B0000ZFDD4
"Beautiful, sexy,Lacey!  Excellent fit.  Love it. Will likely order more colors. Thanks!",B0000ZFDD4
Looks wonderful and the cups fit well...,B0000ZFDD4
"I really like the look of this bra.  The details on the straps are gorgeous.  I've worn it all day with no issues.  Fits just like a demi bra should, and its gorgeous too.",B0000ZFDD4
I'm back to buy again.  Had this a few years ago.  Wore it until it wore out. Stretched out too much and started looking ratty.  It was worth every penny.  Hugged my 34DDs well and gave a nice fleshy feel.  (I prefer a little natural  springy movement and no padding).  Bending over didn't work out so well with this.  Great bra for lower cut tops when I want to feel a little special.,B0000ZFDD4
"This arrived today.  I tried it on,  and it's absolutely perfect!  Very comfortable.  I will be purchasing more!",B0000ZFDD4
"The lining is the right size, but the lace is too big for the lining.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love the bra, it looks exactly like the picture and arrived early.",B0000ZFDD4
"It is incredibly hard to get bras in my size-especially when you don't want to spend $70.  I ordered this bra with low expectations, feeling like I would probably be sending it back.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  The fit is great, the material is sturdy.  I absolutely love it.  I can't believe how wonderful it is for the price.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have worn this beautiful bra for years, the balconette style presents a lovely decolletage. This is an ideal bra to wear beneath low cut tops, the lace detail on the cups looks sexy enough to to invite a peek.
Several of the colors have a contrasting lining with the same color ribbon woven into the straps. I cannot say enough good things about the Harlow.
I will say when I originally purchased this style I was surprised by the measurement of the back strap. It is 3 hooks high. Also, the lace on the cups is textured, and noticeable under smooth clothing.",B0000ZFDD4
Happy to find this bra have worn for years and like the bra with lower cut tops.  I have it in black also.searchef,B0000ZFDD4
Have the same bra in a different color so I decided to order this one and it was strangely toooo large and definitely not the same size,B0000ZFDD4
"much brighter than expected. At first I thought i was sent the wrong color. Practically neon. Baggy and poorly fitting, like I ordered a DDD and got an E or F.",B0000ZFDD4
"I was conflicted about whether to order this bra.  I love the look of it and was excited for the wider band, but was concerned the cup would not offer much in the way of support... and I was right.  It looks great and the fabric feels nice.  The lace is beautiful and a bit stretchy.  However, I get more support from a cami than I do this bra.  There is a very thin lining and no padding at all.  I will be returning the bra for a refund.",B0000ZFDD4
Good considering it is an underwire but definitely not an 18 hour bra.  It is just not that comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
Fits pretty good. Definitely good for larger breasts.,B0000ZFDD4
"Its nice to look at but too small for my Double D's, I ordered it in the size that should fit yet this was still too small. This was the last and only bra I ordered online, bras are something I think I will have to do in person.",B0000ZFDD4
Gorgeous color and perfect fit!,B0000ZFDD4
"I wanted something sexy. This bra is sexy, and pretty. My only complaint is it doesn't have any padding at all, and practically 0 support. It's just lace, and under wire. So unless you have perfectly shaped boobs, or 100% comfortable with the way you are then this probably isn't the bra for you. With it being just lace it doesn't give you any shape. I would not recommend it for a everyday bra, only romantic times.",B0000ZFDD4
"Good product, runs large.  Should've gone one cup smaller.",B0000ZFDD4
"The straps are to long, and doesn't offer much support.",B0000ZFDD4
"great fit, doesn't jab me anywhere, very durable and I feel great in it! If you're looking for something sexy AND supportive, you've found it!",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is beautiful! It is not padded but very comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
"Gorgeous color and great fit, will definitely be buying more!",B0000ZFDD4
"Fabric a bit flimsy, pretty bra though.",B0000ZFDD4
Is a great bra for a big breasted woman trap in a small figure !!! I'm a 34ddd maybe even FF but this bra was perfect the only thing is I was not to in press with the fabric looks like is going to rip soon ... Hope not but overall great fit,B0000ZFDD4
"All my large chested women know, it can be difficult finding bras in our size.  I bought this beautiful bra in a 38DDD and it's perfect and reasonably priced. Arrived on time, comfortable and I will probably buy more in different colors.",B0000ZFDD4
Great fit. Awesome lift. Would buy again.,B0000ZFDD4
"Ok I'm 5,9 were a 32 ddd yes there are real but it's hard for me to find bars that fit me and don't make them look funny but this is the best one iv got in a long time I love the way it make me fell I would walk around my house in only this and the underwear I got with this I got both of them In red like I said I got a 32ddd and a m underwear its very sexy",B0000ZFDD4
"This is an attractive bra, fits as expected.

This is an attractive bra. I have a D cup and the bra  does not quite cover the bust, but not a problem. The color is bright and the fabric is very  comfortable on the skin.",B0000ZFDD4
Fits great!  Looks great!  Beautiful bra.,B0000ZFDD4
I like this bra the only thing is that no matter how tight or loose the straps are they keep sliping off my shoulders and I have to use a paperclip to hold them up but otherwise I like the bra and it feels great ( :,B0000ZFDD4
"I haven't had a bra fit me this well, ever!",B0000ZFDD4
"As a large busted lady I have always had issues with finding the right bra. My back is narrow and bust size is DDD. Felina, Simone Perele & Chantelle are in my opinion the best ones out there! Great coverage & very flattering. It's hard to find a great looking bra, that also makes u feel good about yourself especially being a size 32/34 DDD",B0000ZFDD4
"If you have large breasts this bra isn't for you. The straps are very stretchy in the front, so they don't provide support. You'll be bouncing all over the place.",B0000ZFDD4
"It would have been great but the straps were too long, no support",B0000ZFDD4
"Full coverage for gals with larger chests. The color is so pretty and the fit is perfect. My boobs were contained all day and I was actually comfortable! I had no spillage on the top, which normally happens when I get demi bras (I got 36D) I will definitely be buying more of these bras!",B0000ZFDD4
"I purchased the 32D bra and it's very snug. It has 3 separate hooks (a total of 9 hooks) so if it's too tight, you can loosen it. The straps are wide and sturdy. There is no padding in the cups. It's thin material. So the middle of the cups look kind of weird to me but for $11 I'll keep it. It's very beautiful! It arrived on time. I might purchase again if other colors go on sale.",B0000ZFDD4
It's a pretty bra. Good quality. I'm a true 34DDD but could have taken this bra in a DD,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought and really liked it. I am planning to buy other colors as well, in addition to the blue one",B0000ZFDD4
"Very nice bra, but did not fit me as well as Felina Monica style, which is perfect. Had to return for fit.",B0000ZFDD4
Pretty bra with a nice fit for larger breasts.,B0000ZFDD4
"Wires had to be bent out to keep from rubbing my chest,  overall a great bra.",B0000ZFDD4
This is a super sexy bra. Crossdressing guy here. This holds my forms wonderfully and is so sexy. I wear 38d and this fits perfectly. So cute.,B0000ZFDD4
My wife loves this bra. It was very different from her typical padded bras however she likes the natural feel with just enough support. Looks great as well.,B0000ZFDD4
"My favorite bra ever! So cute and comfortable, and the fit was so perfect when I first got it. Unfortunately it stretched out quickly due to me wearing it pretty much every day. I might buy more of these in the future and cycle through them so that they last longer. The color of the lace is much more vibrant in person (which I loved, but if you are looking for a more pale/pastel bra, this may not be exactly what you want).",B0000ZFDD4
this seemed to fit me a little large than expected.,B0000ZFDD4
"A little tight for a 38,  cups are snug.",B0000ZFDD4
No padding and the bra is a bit unconfortable. Will not be buying again.,B0000ZFDD4
Poor quality lace and it is really uncomfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
Fits well and looks great.  Exactly what I was looking for.,B0000ZFDD4
Im a 34DD and these fit amazing and perfect. I have Breast augmentation and wanted something with out a lot of padding and this is the bra I've been looking for.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's pretty but the straps are too long so you can't adjust them to where you'd like. I have a small back and small shoulders but a huge rack so being able to adjust it is really important. I can't wear this if I'm doing anything even a tiny bit jiggly. Otherwise, it's pretty and flattering when it fits right.",B0000ZFDD4
"I wasn't sure whether I should list this as ""somewhat small"" or ""somewhat large"" because the cups are a bit big while the band size is so tight! I'm a 32DDD through and through, so I know I bought the right size. It's a pretty bra, but I can't see myself wearing it too often because of these difficulties. It unfortunately might be a ""bedroom only"" bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"It was very uncomfortable and rough, and did nothing to support me. It looked lovely, but that wasn't enough. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because of the easy return.",B0000ZFDD4
"Lots of bras claim to be a large cup size and are not. This DDD cup size delivers as spacious enough. I am excited to find a bra that fits comfortably that when I Bend over things stay in place and
don't spill out.",B0000ZFDD4
"I bought a black bra and a white bra over a year ago and absolutely loved them.  I'm big chested and it's hard to find a good bra that isn't padded so I was ecstatic I found these.  Recently I bought the blue and light pink bras and am very disappointed, I wore the blue bra a couple times before the wire came out.  So I checked the pink one and it doesn't look like it will last much longer either, where the wire is looks worn.
I've had these less than a month.",B0000ZFDD4
"This does not fit a 40DDD lady as the picture would show even with the straps doubled up all the way. Very comfortable, but does not look cute. There is a lot of area that sticks out on the side of the bra.",B0000ZFDD4
Not the best support but who cares. It's an indoor bra. The fabric is so lovely. The lilac color is so dreamy. I'd buy it again.,B0000ZFDD4
Wire poked through after 6 months of wear.,B0000ZFDD4
"I am a size 38DDD. I thought I would play it safe and order one size larger because I thought just maybe it would be a little too small. Nope, the larger size was too big. So just be sure to order the size that you are. I switched it out for a 38DDD and it fits perfectly.
Now, about the bra....it is a beautiful bra! I have a difficult time finding very pretty lacy bras and this one is perfect. I just got it today and have worn it all day, so far it is comfortable and supportive and I love the balcony style it gives me. It is supportive yet I feel free. This bra may not work for everyone because some people find under-wire bras uncomfortable, but I am so used to under-wire bras that I don't really notice it's there.
I saw that some of the reviews on here said that the straps are too long. Not for me. I appreciate the long straps because I prefer to let my chest be natural; I don't care for the ""pull yourself up as high as possible style"". I like the natural look.
A very pretty bra, I recommend for every lady either to just wear on special occasions or more often.",B0000ZFDD4
I LOVE THIS BRA!  I had to send my UK34DD back ONLY because the stitching was missing in the inner center where the underwire would poke out.  I am excited to get my replacement and begin wearing it ASAP!  The lace is NOT scratchy and it seems to be well-made for the price.  I am a happy customer!,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this recently in the chrome/silver color. It's extremely sexy,and beautiful. I forgot that it's unlined, but I can wear it with t-shirts nothing too sheer. I have had problems in the past finding good bras. This is my second felina bra, it did dig a little underneath my breasts but it's not bad. It fits somewhat better than other bras I have, definitely want more of felina since they have beautiful designs and aren't as expensive as Victoria's Secret.",B0000ZFDD4
Very very good quality and fits perfect,B0000ZFDD4
This bra is great if you like having your nipples pop out every time you bend over.,B0000ZFDD4
It is pretty. The lace is soft but itchy and the underwire poked at the sides. Going to the cute but wear infrequently pile.,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful and sexy! So excited to see lift in a 36 DDD while still being pretty! Only one reason this didn't get 5 stars: straps are so long! I wish I was able to make them shorter! Hint: hand wash gently!,B0000ZFDD4
Cute not much support if you are gifted with larger than C cup.,B0000ZFDD4
The bra was comfortable and fit perfect but didn't last long before the under wire came out,B0000ZFDD4
"Very nice, looks great, good material",B0000ZFDD4
I wanted to love this bra but it was more like wearing Armour.  The band size was exactly right but the cups were too big (I ordered a D cup) overall it was not comfortable at all.,B0000ZFDD4
"The wire in this bra is too short for the channel so if it has worked it's way to the center front of the bra it is digging in your side and is VERY painful and uncomfortable.
I love the styling and appearance of the bra but unless you are willing to put a tack to prevent the wire from sliding or are willing to keep shifting it into your arm pit it is going to be unwearable.",B0000ZFDD4
"Cups are loose on the top edge of the bra in my true size, 34D even at tightest settings. May try 34C to see if that fixes. Otherwise a beautiful single-layer balconet that's not full of unnecessary stuffing.",B0000ZFDD4
There is a weird double layer of sheer material in this bra that I couldn't get to lie flat. I found the bra slightly uncomfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
Very comfy. There is no padding at all. The lace is put in such a way it gives a little support. Wash by hand only. The band and straps are long enough.,B0000ZFDD4
"The bra looked beautiful but the fit was atrocious. The cup was too large and offered no support, and it was impossible to tighten the straps adequately, so they hung loose. Honestly, I can't even tell what size I would have to order in this bra to get a good fit.  Someone needs to go back to the drawing board with this, I think.",B0000ZFDD4
Gives large breast a strange shape,B0000ZFDD4
"A little less substantial than I expected from photos, but it's served me well for about 6 months.  The matching panties are comfy and look great even on my XL butt.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra. Definitely lifts and separates.,B0000ZFDD4
Very comfortable bra as well as beautiful. Fits true to size.,B0000ZFDD4
"Bra doesn't really do much for my boobs if I'm wearing it under my clothes, BUT it is very pretty if that's all you're wearing (;",B0000ZFDD4
"I LOVE this bra.  I love Felina, they fit me great.  It is really hard to find alluring bras in a 40D and this one is beautiful and sexy but also supportive.  I highly recommend it.  It feels very comfortable and looks pretty.  I will be purchasing more.",B0000ZFDD4
"It fits perfect, give you support, it feels very confortable and looks beautiful",B0000ZFDD4
Absolutely does not fit.  I can't wear it.,B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is unmolded, but it does look just like the picture. When I tried it on, it was a little small, maybe a cup smaller. Therefore I returned it.",B0000ZFDD4
It's ok I took the label off so I can't return it. So I'm stuck with them,B0000ZFDD4
"i LOVE all the Felina Harlow bras!!!!!!!!!!!  I fear the day they don't make them anymore!!  As with large boobs and underwire bras, I just wish they lasted forever, but eventually the wire does poke through.",B0000ZFDD4
felina is a great brand for lingerie! the bra fits and looks great.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love these bras, very comfortable. I wish I would have ordered a cup size smaller though. They are just a little loose in the cup and stretch as bit.",B0000ZFDD4
"I don't really like this bra but I don't hate it either.  The cup size is a bit strange and it doesn't seem to support like it should.  The lace is cute, but doesn't really add much coverage.",B0000ZFDD4
"Decorative lace i sewn to a thin fabric to form the cup, and the lace seems like it's a bit too big so it flips up which is aesthetically irritating but you can't really tell with a shirt on. Otherwise fits great and is very comfortable!",B0000ZFDD4
"It fits pretty nicely, but the color was completely unexpected! I ordered ""Azalea"" which is kind of a dusty, subtle, cool pink, and I got a bra that was a shocking bubblegum pink! Like seriously it is SO bright. Thankfully I like bright pink too, so it's not an issue. In fact, it's really my only complaint about the bra.

Edit: I had originally left a higher, positive review, but I have to change that now. I've owned this bra less than two weeks and the underwire already broke through the front. Thankfully there are a few ways to fix this problem, but I really think if you spend $30 on a bra it shouldn't fall apart in less than two weeks. Talk about flimsy. Between that and getting a bra in the wrong color, I really wouldn't advise anyone else to spend money on this product.",B0000ZFDD4
"It is absolutely beautiful and comfortable! I was a little worried how this would fit, because I do not have the same body as the model. I will purchase again.",B0000ZFDD4
"It fits well, 5 stars on that.  I gave it 3 stars because it makes my girls look too pointy!  Also an unlined bra on larger chested women doesn't seem to work to well.  The underwire digs in close to the arm pits.  These are the reasons I sent it back.

There are a couple good things it's sexy for one.  And 2 it has a space between the lace and inner lining for a pad or support.

If you are looking for lingerie and won't wear it all day, then go for it!
If you are looking for a sexy comfortable bra, I would look elsewhere!!",B0000ZFDD4
"I ordered a 36 B, it was tight using the last hook.
I am 5'2"", 132 lbs. I returned the Bra because it was not 100% black.
It had a brown interface. It I better on a person who is taller I think.
It did not fit me like the model.  It was very low cut. I gave it 5 stars
for the price and fine quality.",B0000ZFDD4
Perfect fit! I now want one in every color.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is cute but it doesn't let you adjust the straps very good and it was about 2 cup sizes too big. I buy this same bra size off places all the time and read the ""measurements."" really upset they are dramatically off.",B0000ZFDD4
Very sexy and cute. Will definitely order more. The matching underwear is adorable too,B0000ZFDD4
"Ended up tossing this one after trying two different sizes. It was pretty, however the straps and design was not supportive enough. After eating it my breasts started popping out (muffin topping out of the top of the bra) and it was embarrassing. Also there was a weird pucker with the fabric near the straps. Honestly, if you have a large chest and a small waist I would recommend a Wacoal bra, the Embrace is a fantastic lacy option.",B0000ZFDD4
Straps are a little uncomfortable and scratchy,B0000ZFDD4
"The fit was awkward for me, so had to be returned. The cup size was fine, but I think my breasts are too heavy for this type of bra. They needed more support.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra seemed comfortable, but the cup was larger than expected.  I had to return for a smaller cup size.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is a bit uncomfortable and smaller than expected. I can wear it an entire day, but it's not a top pick daily. It's a great price, but it's not comfortable enough to wear on a regular basis.",B0000ZFDD4
Attractive. Fits well. Agree with those who feel it is not all day support - but great for low impact days or going out special.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love this bra!!! I ended up buying duplicates in several colors. It has taken forever to find a great bra and this one is awesome! It fits well (which is a challenge) but is also comfortable, cute and sexy. (Had to add in thin pads to cover nipples but still love this bra!)",B0000ZFDD4
Very nice line of clothing accessories.  Fit my wife perfectly.,B0000ZFDD4
"Ordered in my size, received it in the mail in a timely fashion, tried it on, and it fit too large. I have returned it.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is super pretty but it is not lined!,B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty and comfortable.  It is hard to find this style of bra in my size.,B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful brazierre and a lovely brand. Removed the tags too quickly!,B0000ZFDD4
"This is the most comfortable and sexy bra I have tried in a long time.  I was very cautious buying online, but I just ordered 2 more.  As a large chested woman, I have a difficult time finding a bra that fits well, comfortably and looks nice as well.  Very sexy, very excited to bring these along on an upcoming romantic vacation!",B0000ZFDD4
"Wow, amazing fitting bra, they fit like they were made for me not to mention they look really awesome on. I got them in three colors and plan to get all of them in time as they are really affordable. I purchased them in 36DDD the cup is mesh with an extra soft inner layer for extra support, full cup but peekaboo at the same time wide side band for us who need it and most of us do.
The straps are a bit too long on me but nothing that can't be altered. (DEPEND ON THE BODY TYPE)
Thanks.",B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra but way too small,B0000ZFDD4
This brand consistently fits very well.,B0000ZFDD4
"Not as soft as other bras, but very cute.",B0000ZFDD4
This is my most comfortable and cute bra.,B0000ZFDD4
A very pretty bra-- but cups run a bit small go up one size in cup or frame.,B0000ZFDD4
My first time using an unlined bra and this one supports as much as any of my push ups. I love the way it feels and the band is generous. The color is a gorgeous red with pink lining.,B0000ZFDD4
Perfect fit and sexy to boot. An excellent purchase.,B0000ZFDD4
"I adore this bra! I bought it in two colors, black and hibiscus. They are both so pretty and fit perfectly. It's been a long time since I wore an unpadded bra but I love this and it fits my 34DD just perfectly. Plus they are cute as heck.",B0000ZFDD4
"No sized the same as US, made in China.",B0000ZFDD4
I like the styling and design but it does fit a bit smaller than expected.  It does stretch a bit but probably would have ordered a size up.  I will not return as it is able to be worn but could have used a bit more room.,B0000ZFDD4
"Band is tighter than usual, cups slightly larger than usual. Overall, very pretty bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"very pretty soft fabric,cup size as expected. too tight around rib cage but i had not bought this brand before so next time will go x1 full size up.",B0000ZFDD4
"Best bra ever. I remember buying a victoria secret one identical to this one for $36+ years ago and i loved it and couldn't find it anymore. It keeps boobs up and perky but separate so they're not squished together, best cleavage in my opinion. I'm a 38C/D I got a 38C and I love the way this bra fits.",B0000ZFDD4
Very comfy and cute. I like this bra a lot.,B0000ZFDD4
"Pros: very wide straps, 3 hooks in the back
Cons: unlined

I didn't realize it was unlined, which is the main reason I'm going to return it. It does fit fine though. I went with 32DDD.",B0000ZFDD4
This is the second bra I have ordered. It is hard to find larger cup bras that are sexy and not full coverage. This fit the bill and supports my DD girls just fine. I wish it came in all colors- all with the matching thong.,B0000ZFDD4
Not as supportive as I would like for everyday wear but a very pretty and comfortable bra! 36DDD here and it is nice to have a pretty bra that fits well!,B0000ZFDD4
Felt it was a bit smaller. Don't expect nipple coverage on this one. You can see headlights big time. Super sexy for bedroom wear.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is an interesting bra.  It's not a push up and it's not a minimizer.  It's not super supportive but it's actually quite comfortable.  It covers and it holds, which is hard to find.  It's just real unusual to have such a ""casual"" bra.  I really like it.  We will see how it stands up after a couple of washes.",B0000ZFDD4
Got it on right now. love it!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a beautiful bra, made very well. Unfortunately, it was just too big in the cup size. I was disappointed.",B0000ZFDD4
"I ordered this bra because it such a beautiful, classy bra. It is also made very well. Unfortunately, the cup size was too big and I ended up sending it back. Needless to say I was disappointed.",B0000ZFDD4
Sexy bra - haven't worn it yet but I love it!,B0000ZFDD4
Weird gapping in the front - wear 38dd- returning!,B0000ZFDD4
She looks awesome in it! She loves the fit and I love seeing it fit!,B0000ZFDD4
Wonderful bra! Great support without adding extra bulk. Size DD fits as expected and the band seems to run on size. The lace bunches a tad but I think it will lay out flat over time. Not really able to wear under anything too light as the wrinkles will show but it makes my breast look amazing so worth keeping for sure.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's a gorgeous bra, but there's not much give, so definitely get the bigger size if you're between sizes.",B0000ZFDD4
"36D is my normal size. It fits somewhat small, but the elastic begins to give in all bras eventually, so I'm keeping it.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is beautiful. It would have been perfect if the FIT was RIGHT. It fit too big, I usually wear a 32dd or 34dd depending on the bra, This bra as a 34dd fit me like a 38ddd. I suggest going at least 2 bra sizes down. I'm going to try a smaller size because I love the design.",B0000ZFDD4
"Ok so here is the deal... This bra is amazingly comfy. As in..bring with you on family tripa because you don't wanna go bra less around your mother in law even if you are in your pajamas comfy. As a chestier woman I find it difficult to gets bras that are both functional and comfy without the dreaded unaboob. I think of I were to purchase again I may go up a cup size for fuller coverage, but this fits very well. Now don't go expecting miracles though as this is unlined and unpadded. The bra will bring the girls up to a natural height, but won't do any push up, magic fluffing, or high impact support. Just routine support in comfort.",B0000ZFDD4
"I'm not typically one to post reviews on products but this one was needed. The fit is inaccurate, the under wire is flimsy, and the hold is weak. I have been having a very difficult time finding a bra that fits well and does its job and shall add this one to the list of disappointments.",B0000ZFDD4
returning for a b.tempt'd by wacoal womens ciao bella balconette bra.this bra has a odd large spot where my breast does not fill.i adjusted the bra several different ways and it was still there.otherwise the bra fit fine.wish it could of worked out.,B0000ZFDD4
sexy but wish it was more supportive.only wearing it at home or with dresses.,B0000ZFDD4
Fit very odd. Fabric itched and made my boobs look very strange. I am a 32DDD and after having my son they aren't firm like they use to be so I need for of a supportive bra.,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a 34b and it fit me perfectly. The cups do point a tiny bit in the middle at the seam that runs over the nipple but this isn't a bra I planned on wearing under anything other than flannels and heavier sweaters anyway so it doesn't matter to me. Straps are nice and sturdy, this bra feels nicely made and holy heck is it pretty. I recommend.",B0000ZFDD4
Excellent fit and very good quality,B0000ZFDD4
"The look is cute on, but very uncomfortable from straps and no actual support to breast",B0000ZFDD4
"the lace is very stiff and scratchy at the bottom, also it is lined so not see through, I returned it becasue I don't like to be uncomfortable and my hubby did not like the lining.",B0000ZFDD4
Band was way too tight!  Returned.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a lovely bra that gives me comfort throughout the day. Since it's made of nylon, the fabric doesn't chafe my breast/s so often.",B0000ZFDD4
"i want to start out by saying i have a horrible time finding a bra that actually fits me! and this one does. i am a 40DD, and i always spill out of bras but with this one...it fits perfectly!",B0000ZFDD4
Amazing! Totally in love with it! it fits so nicely and definitely worth the price. I am so pleased with the quality and comfort. I will be buying it again for sure!,B0000ZFDD4
Fit is wonderful..... Really Sexy!,B0000ZFDD4
"nice stretchy material and great fit, it looks very pretty.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love this bra, it's beautiful and looks great on. It is also great quality!",B0000ZFDD4
It is cute and comfortable but it runs a little big.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is so comfortable! However, despite fitting well, it has absolutely no support. The only time I can wear this is underneath something baggy because otherwise it looks like I'm practically not wearing a bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love, love, love this bra!  It's beautiful, comfortable and gives great support!  It's exactly what I was looking for!",B0000ZFDD4
"I was pleasantly surprised with this bra.  I've been buying Victoria secret bras since I can remember but feel like the quality has gone down and prices have gone up.  I started searching for new bras and came across this one.  I ordered two by accident but they are both great and I'm so excited to have found them.  They fit just as expected.  They are beautiful, comfortable and have great support.  I would definitely purchase more.",B0000ZFDD4
"My regular bra is a full bodied bra, so while it doesn't have push up padding, it does have *some* padding. I bought this bra in the same size, and this one sags like none other. I removed the tags so I can't return it. I guess I'll be donating it then...",B0000ZFDD4
"I actually measured this bra and then myself with a tape measure to make sure I hadn't ordered the wrong size. It was fully 9""' too short and I have worn the same size since 1990. Lame.",B0000ZFDD4
"Cups are a bit flimsy, so I'll have to do some alterations. Otherwise it's a pretty bra, with good support.",B0000ZFDD4
"Usually, I have a problem with finding decent coverage all the way around and back. I don't have to constantly adjust myself in this bra. The straps could adjust more instead of half way to make my chest sit a little higher but I'm so happy to not be adjusting myself all the time, that I don't even care about that part. I've already ordered two more.",B0000ZFDD4
Was a very pretty bra but didn't have much support.,B0000ZFDD4
"32 F..... Its so hard to find a Bra for my wife that fits good. This one fits and looks Amazing. She loves it. No Side Boob. I loved it, she loved it. We bought 4 more in Different Colors. All 5 Amazing.",B0000ZFDD4
"It is kind of push upy......fits great for the hard to fit, but does put every thing up and out!",B0000ZFDD4
I am disappointed that the wiring is already poking me on my side. I expect this to happen after SEVERAL washes but not in the first 2 weeks of owning. I will say the color and size are what was promised so that was good.,B0000ZFDD4
could have little better support-coverage for nipple show. otherwise one great bra,B0000ZFDD4
"In my defense, the regular 34D was a little small (side boob) so I got a 34DD and it's a little big for me, but I make it work anyway. The actual bra is really pretty though :)",B0000ZFDD4
"Very sexy, very comfortable, 'very pleased, will buy again",B0000ZFDD4
"I was surprised that the bra fits very well, as a 38DD, that's not always the case.  The straps a little scratchy on my skin, and not great for all day wear, but overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute bra to wear.",B0000ZFDD4
"the band is a little small but other than that it's ok. it does amazing things for my breasts, and I'm a 34DD so to find something for su pport is very hard. the lace is a little itchy, but I'm hoping after a few washings it won't be so bad.",B0000ZFDD4
"Bought sz 36c , it didn't fit properly,  breast hung out on the sides. Bought sz 38d  , fits perfect, looks , feels great. Very pretty,  soft lace,  sexy. order a sz up for a appealing look, sensational fit",B0000ZFDD4
"Excellent product, and basically phenominal for me for the price point, although I'd assume the fit would differ person to person.",B0000ZFDD4
"Size down in the band and maybe up in the cup size if you're on the cusp. The inner cup liner can make a line and give you muffin boob if the bra isn't sized perfectly right. Once you nail the sizing though, the fit is great - really holds you in and gives good separation.",B0000ZFDD4
Really pretty yet still very supportive without giving uniboob effect.,B0000ZFDD4
"The 42DD was a true fit.  The support was okay.  This is definitely a ""date night"" bra, not a wear all day/ to work bra.  The lace on the straps was very scratchy.  I'm hoping it softens after a washing or two.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great bra, fits well and looks pretty",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra. I wear a 38ddd and it fit me perfectly. Holds my girls up in place and looks very sexy. I'm going to order other colors right now.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love, love, love this bra. So comfortable, and very beautiful.",B0000ZFDD4
"As someone who is fairly large chested (36DD) I was nervous about there not being any support, but this bra has a great,strong under-wire and fits like a dream. Definitely would recommend, it looks great on and is pretty comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
"From reading  the reviews, I thought these bras might only look good on women with large breast due to no padding, but this bra looks great even on a cup B. I also thought the under wire would be uncomfortable, but I was totally wrong. I love this bra and I also love this brand. I was first introduced to this designer when I was shopping at Nordstrom. I really am a fan of these bras and will continue to buy them. They do make you feel sexy. I bought it in black and tan. They also make a great versatile strapless bra (check them out). You can use the the straps or remove them.",B0000ZFDD4
Love these bras they fit well. Great brand,B0000ZFDD4
Liked the bra but had to get a cup larger than my normal size,B0000ZFDD4
Awful. I read the reviews thinking this would be the perfect bra. I couldn't snap it on. Also doesn't have padding.,B0000ZFDD4
Bought this at a boutique and loved it so bought another one here sexy and comfortable I need more so I can where one every day haha,B0000ZFDD4
"Fits well in the band, but the cups are too generous to do anything for me. As I am in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy, I thought about keeping it until my milk comes in in the hopes that it would fit well then, but if it doesn't that would put me past the return window, so back it goes. Didn't have any objections to the fabric or cut or anything, except it's just not the right fit for my current bust!",B0000ZFDD4
"I have several square neck tops and it is difficult to find bras that don't show under these tops.  This bra is well cut, works great with my tops, and fits comfortably.",B0000ZFDD4
"The product is beautiful, but fits too small",B0000ZFDD4
"Really cute, little itchy at times.",B0000ZFDD4
"I loved this bra so much, I have just ordered more.  It fits perfectly.  Cup size just right.  It fits better than bras I have purchased in department stores.  Hope they keep making it!",B0000ZFDD4
"Thought it would be higher quality. Fits ok, little awkward where the bra straps meet the bra. Not the most comfortable thing, but pretty. Lace is kinda itchy. Wouldn't wear it all day long.",B0000ZFDD4
If it has no lining then it would be just the black lace. Unfortunately is has a beige lining that pinches at the top of the breast causing a dent. With this in mind it is also not a demi cup but more of a whole breast cover.,B0000ZFDD4
I may have gone up a cup size and didn't realize. I have a large bust and small ribs and back. The band fit perfect but the cups are small and not very supporting. Otherwise a nice bra very pretty and super soft lace.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's ok, but I am a bit disappointed. The straps cause the cups to pull in a bit at the sides, giving my breasts a somewhat odd shape in it. The band cuts in after several hours of wear. One of those bras that comes off as soon as I get home.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is so lovely but the 32DD fits a bit narrower than most felina bras. perhaps it is just the style.,B0000ZFDD4
"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this bra fit. Everything fits in and the wires create a nice separation in the middle which is hard to come across with most bras for larger chests.
I just wish they had made the straps so they would have an extra inch or so to be adjusted. They're fine now, but over time the straps tend to give out.",B0000ZFDD4
"Nice item.  This is probably my 6th Felina, over more than a decade, same style.  I keep coming back to it. They support are pretty and give good cleavage.  This bra is a staple in my wardrobe.",B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty but is itchy and not so comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
LOVE this bra. I am large busted and the underwires actually lay against my chest- which is very rare! comfortable and I recommend!,B0000ZFDD4
"Not a lot of support and a little itchy, but it's really pretty and fits well. (A little big if anything, but actually pretty right on.) Great for looks, not great for day to day.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have been having a HECK of a time finding bras that fit my 36 DDD top. Your choices are pretty much overweight granny or... commando. This bra is BEAUTIFUL, fits perfectly, and doesn't give me torpedo chest or five-inch straps. Truly, I've only had it on for five minutes but it is very comfortable, functional and GORGEOUS so far!

Thank god for Amazon :)",B0000ZFDD4
ordered a 34DD received a 36C (rolling eyes),B0000ZFDD4
i am 38C and the middle section of the front hits a little weird and hurts.  Maybe after a few washings this will be more comfortable.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a wonderful bra ! Functionality, style and sexiness all in one.",B0000ZFDD4
Nice. Really nice. Especially for the price...,B0000ZFDD4
It is so comfy but yet so sexy looking!,B0000ZFDD4
"Comfy, durable, attractive. Good fit.",B0000ZFDD4
"For sizing, I am a 32DD and that's what I ordered, though I find the underwire to be quite tight and would probably have opted for a 34 band size instead. The biggest con with this bra is how thick the underwire feels in the center, almost like it's pressing on my sternum. The lace is not exactly soft, but I don't find it to be particularly itchy, either. The cup size is basically perfect. I was worried about getting an unlined bra in DD, but the cups fit just as well as any other type of bra, so that's great.

As far as how it looks, it's really quite pretty! I got the city rose color and am very pleased. The detail on the straps and little bows are really cute, and the lace is lovely, especially how it lies straight across the ribcage. So, even though the fit isn't perfect, it looks so sexy it outweighs that complaint.",B0000ZFDD4
Doesn't fit like its suppose to,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this for the look of the straps and the fact that it was unlined. Fits exactly as expected and is super comfortable. If you are looking for something that is stylish and comfortable this is the bra for you. I love that the straps have a pattern to them, looks great under some of the new mesh and see through materials that make up the shoulders of all those new styles.",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits great!!!! Didn't take long to arrive, I was so excited that I had to try it on as soon as it came.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a good bra. My review of the Felina contour bra was less than satisfied. Not so here.

While the bra seems to run a tad small, it wasn't too small, and actually fit really well with the padding removed. If you can live without the padding (D cup really doesn't need it) then it's a great choice.

Good quality and nice style, that's what I expect from a Felina.",B0000ZFDD4
"Gentlemen, stop reading.

This is the perfect bra if you have lots of under-boob, or whatever they want to call it when a regular triangle-shaped bra cup is left kind of saggy and empty toward the top of the triangle even though the cup is nicely filled out. So if you have suffered as I have suffered, get this bra. It's pretty and feminine but still feels supportive. It'll shape your boobs differently/better than the regular triangle bra cup. Give it a try!",B0000ZFDD4
"I got a tad bit larger size than I normally do, just in case (bad experiences being maimed by rogue underwire), but I still have slight bruises on my side from the bra shifting and underwire rubbing against me roughly. Could be sizing error on my part.",B0000ZFDD4
Love this bra!  I'd been looking for something with a little more sex appeal than my usual functional T-shirt bra and couldn't stomach the $70+ price tag for comparable bras.  I'll be ordering another one in a different color.,B0000ZFDD4
Pretty bra...cup size fit great....but I wish I had ordered a size larger. Couldn't see myself wearing this bra all day as it is a bit itchy not sure the straps could be supportive over time (plus size full bust here) But nice peice to feel sexy in ;),B0000ZFDD4
"Quite comfortable but there's a gap at the top, cups too big.",B0000ZFDD4
Cups did not hold up well.  Just missed the cut-off to return,B0000ZFDD4
Its very cute and sexy it doesn't give much more lift/ support than you would have without a bra. I am a 38DDD and the cup fit perfectly. the straps are pretty itchy the first couple of days. and the strap that goes around you and clips in the back is pretty snug (but im sure it'll stretch over a few wears) I would prefer more lift and cleavage but my boyfriend says it looks sexy so i kept it. There is no padding at all. So if you want a sexy bra that gives lift extra cleavage and it padded this is not the bra for you. It is also a little fragile when it comes to tugging and shifting it around.,B0000ZFDD4
"This is actually a very pretty unlined bra, IF you adjust to their sizing.  This is sized for a full bust.  I'm not augmented or a super full breasted woman, but 32DD is my trusty size 90+% of the time.  Ex... Maidenform (or plunge styles in other brands), I often have to go up a cup.  Other brands like Penache, Felina, Fauve, Bali, Natori, Wacoal, Curvy Kate, Fantasie, etc...32DD is generally spot on, especially in the demi and half cup styles.  In this bra, I ordered a 32D, based on reviews.  It's a nice fit.  For someone who has implants or naturally full busted all around, your usual size should be fine.",B0000ZFDD4
"Love it, just wish it had a little more lift ;-)",B0000ZFDD4
"Great price , fast shipper ...as advertised .quality product .....  Thanks  . ..",B0000ZFDD4
"This is super comfy for a lacy bra. As with any lacy underwire, it'll start to rub after like 12 hours, but it's great until then.",B0000ZFDD4
Love this bra. It is very thin and still able to support large breasts.,B0000ZFDD4
"I absolutely love this bra. I keep buying more of them.  They fit perfect, no lining so they don't make you look bigger than you are, wide straps which work great on boatneck tops, and very sexy.  I have them in every color.",B0000ZFDD4
I think I would have kept it if the length around the body would have fit more like a 34. It's fit was more of a 36 and that was using the last row of hooks in. Other than that it was cute and sexy even for large breasted woman!,B0000ZFDD4
...not the most supportive bra. More of a lingerie item than an everyday bra.,B0000ZFDD4
"This was very small and it was very hard to bend over without my breasts falling out! I was leaning over one time to pick up parts that fell(at my job) and my breasts feel out, and I was getting all kinds of looks from the people around me! This stinks!",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra. It's perfect. Fits well, doesn't bunch anywhere, and surprisingly, the alabaster is pretty close to my skin tone. I'm naturally pale, and don't get a lot of sun (especially on my torso). This bra is made of ivory lace, with a nude lining that comes through a little bit. So, it blends very well. I can wear it under almost anything without it showing through. Might be a nice contrast on tan people, or subtle nude of pale folk!",B0000ZFDD4
I did read some review saying they band fit a little snug and it does. But the bra is beautiful when put on. If you're not used to the lace material it can take some getting used to. Please be aware that the bra is somewhat see thru. Will be purchasing again.,B0000ZFDD4
"Wires poke out too easily. Inner lining of bra gets ripped. I often have to sew it to repair where the wires stab out. Lovely bra, but impractical and runs a little small as well as being fragile as hell.",B0000ZFDD4
A bit uncomfortable for long term use but it's beautiful and sexy,B0000ZFDD4
"first of all, let me say, i'm victoria's secret girl, i had been buying their products for years, but i wanted to look for cheaper alternative. So i searched and read reviews, and decided to try. the result, i'll keep this bra and will wear on laundry days, but i'll pay for quality. This bra fits me ok, but has no support whatsoever. I'm 36DDD. It feels a but tight, but cup size is close enough. It's a bit too rough for a bra, i expected a more softer and durable product. I don't know how long it will last, but i rather buy one bra from VS then 3 of those.",B0000ZFDD4
Beautiful bra but it seems a little small in the cup size.,B0000ZFDD4
"If you often find that your bra fits perfectly except for a tiny bit of loose fabric on top, try this bra. It fits me so well and is quite comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this brand they make beautiful bras to big breast women.,B0000ZFDD4
"I got the size too big... I used ""modern sizing"" but that was a bad idea.",B0000ZFDD4
my wife loves it but yahoo so do I.,B0000ZFDD4
"I don't know how to explain the fit exactly other than to say when you bend over your boobs fall out.  The cup fabric is too loose at the top.  I have 3 of these in various sizes and they all do this.  I don't think they were made for women who are ""naturally gifted"" in this area.... if you're above a C I'd say keep shopping!",B0000ZFDD4
"Aside from being a beautifully designed, I am a true 34DDD and it fits wonderfully.
My mom purchased this for me as a gift and I couldn't me more happier with it. The girls are sitting where they're supposed to be now :)",B0000ZFDD4
Terrible fit. Not comfortable and the cup indents and looks so strange. No support and the straps are to long. It is deceiving in the photo. Bad quality bra. I'm sticking to Victorias Secret for my lingerie.,B0000ZFDD4
Just as great as everyone here said it would be. :),B0000ZFDD4
"Wow ladies. I mean, wow. Im 22 yrs old. I wear a 34DDD Ive had a problem with my girls since I got them! Lol & forget cute or sexy bras (or even the right size, without breaking the bank @ vickys) but this bra is amazing. It fits me to a tee I love love love it. Worth every penny!",B0000ZFDD4
One of the best fitting bras for my size.  Actually cute.  Not miles of fabric,B0000ZFDD4
"This is the most comfortable bra ever.  It is lined on the inside with a fine mesh, so you don't get scratched by the lace at all.  The profile is very, very flattering.

I'm 5'8"", 130 lbs, and I bought a 36 C.  I tried the D, but it was too large.  Then again, I might just be really bad at sizing bras.  That's also a distinct possibility.",B0000ZFDD4
Lovely look and quality is very good. Would definetly purchase more of this brand's merchandise.,B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is beautiful and looks very sexy on, I am a 36D so it is a little small so I would recommend going one size up. I would order from them again for sure, but I'll be getting a different size next time.",B0000ZFDD4
"it looks great but it is a little bit small, but i still love it",B0000ZFDD4
The strap is sewn on twisted.  Cannot be worn due to major discomfort.,B0000ZFDD4
"i bought these bras for my wife which can be a task at times, however, This item is a gem.  They look great and fit very well.  Highly recommend if you want a personal item she will flatter!",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is very pretty - the only thing I don't really like about the bra is that the straps are placed very far apart- and there is not a good range for how far you can tighten the straps so your breasts kind of are really...separated. There is no 'push in'  or 'centering' effect at all.

 Also, the straps are MUCH thicker than the picture relays.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is pretty. I love the nude lining. The only thing is that the lace does get itchy after a couple of hours of wearing it. I'll just be wearing it at night for my man.,B0000ZFDD4
"Very pretty, very sexy and comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this bra for the money. This fits like a bra twice the price. The wider band lends support.,B0000ZFDD4
Finally something fits right and breathable to wear. Thank you.,B0000ZFDD4
"I loved the feel of this bra! The only problem is that I feel like they run a bit small in the measurements, the cup size fit, but the band was a little too tight, I'm normally a 38D, but I ordered the 40D just to be on the safe side, and it was still tight and uncomfortable even on the last clasps. I would definitely buy it again, but the sizes are wildly inaccurate. I will be returning it asap.",B0000ZFDD4
"I purchased this bra because I purchased two others that fit just fine.  For some odd reason, the underwire ""magically"" came out of the bra when I washed it and I cannot figure out how to get the wire back in the stinkin' bra! I even had my sister attempt to find where the wire came out of the bra... What really annoys me off is the fact that there is no way to contact the seller about this! I think the manufacturer should repair this bra free of charge! IN any case, don't buy this one because it is too expensive for these types of problems!",B0000ZFDD4
Great fit and coverage for larger breasted women.  the straps don't fall down and there is enough support for a sexier looking bra like this.  highly recommend Felina if you need a fuller cup.,B0000ZFDD4
Very pretty and fits great.  I love the straps and the sheer lining.  I may have to buy additional colors!,B0000ZFDD4
Fits extremely strangely. The cups are very large but only in the upper half. So large that it makes no difference how tight you make the bands.,B0000ZFDD4
"Easily one of my favourite bras, simple and sexy, perfect if you're looking for a lace bra that compliments your melons (I'm a 32DDD/F) You won't regret purchasing this.",B0000ZFDD4
"I am always nervous about ordering clothing online because sizing is so different. But this bra is lovely, fits perfectly and is simply beautiful. It was difficult to determine if the bra was sheer, but it is actually lined with flesh colored fabric. Quite lovely.",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits like a VS bra, which I think runs a little smaller than others. It's made like the VS unlined demi. Seems to be made well. No complaints here.",B0000ZFDD4
I have 3 of these. I love how it holds on around my ribs n keeps everything in place.,B0000ZFDD4
I love it love it love it thank you,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is okay. I wear it on laundry days -- It could be my fault (maybe it's the wrong size?) but it's tight in the middle area, between the breasts (leaves marks) and fits nicely around the boobs. It can sometimes seem loose, but I believe that's just the style. It is quite uncomfortable around the middle breast area but fits on the sides. It makes each boob look like it has it's own cleavage line (separate but united?). It's a little hard to explain. When I wear the bra to work I usually regret it and it hurts a little too much to chill in. But overall, it is a bra.",B0000ZFDD4
The fit was super strange. The fabric and color were very nice but the fit was very odd. I returned.,B0000ZFDD4
Very scratchy fabric. Not great quality.,B0000ZFDD4
"This arrived before ETA which is always a nice touch.  I tried it on to determine if it would be itchy as some reviewers have said, but I had no issues.  My skin is very sensitive and so I put it to the test.  The fit is so comfortable.  I Iove the balconette style because it doesn't add too much exaggeration and seems to hold everything in place quite well.  The color is soft and nice as is the material.  The only drawback is that the material is on the thinner side so it is definitely a warm weather bra.",B0000ZFDD4
I first bought a 32ddd which is the size I was measure for the cup was too big so I reordered a 32dd and it fit perfectly so I ordered three more,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a size 40D but this bra was uncomfortably small, I'm returning it to get a 40DD size.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have found that the best fit for my unequal girls is an unlined demi or balconette, that this bra fits well.  I do wish it came in other bright colors!",B0000ZFDD4
so sad this didn't work. Much smaller than other Felina bra i own. Luckily i had a friend who could wear it.,B0000ZFDD4
Pretty and would have loved but cup was too big and could not exchange for smaller size as it was unavailable. It had potential. No idea if i would have liked if i could have gotten in a smaller cup. I do suspect it would have been a date night bra and not a every day for long hours,B0000ZFDD4
Is pretty but based on other reviews I sized up..should have stuck with my regular size.cups are large and actually a little strange even if they had been smaller.something on the design of this bra was just off for me. I also went up in band size.that can be controlled with the adjustable hooks so no issue there..lace was not scratchy and was pretty,B0000ZFDD4
The straps were to thin and the cups were way to big.  Sent it back.,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm a 36 DDD/DDDD (E/F) depending on the bra. The band is perfect the straps are nice. I'm 4'10"" so I have to tighten them significantly. The lining in the cup is comfortable. The wires are nice and wide. The problem is the cups. They are just a tad too big. I could take them in a 1/4"" and this would be fine. But honestly, I'm not experienced with tailoring undergarments. I won't order a 36DD as I'm concerned that the wires will narrow too much and the cup will be too small. This is advertised as a demi cut but on me it's more like full coverage, the top of the cup comes almost to my collar bone and my shallow breasts just won't fill the top of the cup. I'm not too disappointed as I only paid $17 for the bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great BRA, overall. I am certain my husband would give it 5 stars on looks alone, as it looks great on my skin tone.

I ordered a 36DDD and while the band is not so small it needs an expander, it is rather tightly uncomfortable the longer you were it. Definitely more a ""date""-with-the-hubby type lingerie than comfortable to wear for more than 8 hours, unless you can get away with band size up, but this often creates the illusion of sagging, gaps, and backfat, so, not always the best idea.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love Felina bras!  They are perfect if you want to feel sexy and surprise your husband after work, as they are very discreet under work clothing.",B0000ZFDD4
My item came within 2 days.  When I tried on the bra it fit too high up on my chest area and was very uncomfortable!!!!!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is not what I expected. The thin shoulder straps dig into my shoulders and the lack of lining make the shoulder straps support all of the breast. This leaves the breast with an unnatural shape, like an indention in the breast. I will be returning this item.",B0000ZFDD4
A little stiffer than I would have liked. But because the waist does run slightly smaller it fit a bit snug in the underbust and under the arms. I am sure that also the stiffness contributed to that. But if you order a size up on the waist size and are looking for something sexy and not something to wear for support all day it is a super cute and sexy bra...,B0000ZFDD4
"Beautiful bra, and one if the most comfortable I've bought in a very long Tim.",B0000ZFDD4
"Haven't had the same issues with the black as I did with the white. The white one was very poor quality.  They both look amazing, this one has lasted longer though.",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits as expected, with a nice thick band.",B0000ZFDD4
"Just what the title says. I'm usually a 32DD/E but not in this bra. I will edit my review based on how/if I can exchange, and how the new size fits.",B0000ZFDD4
"It's so pretty and fits so well. It's wonderful. Fits under my clothing with no problem, doesn't bulge out or create any weird breast shapes. I love it.",B0000ZFDD4
It seems like all bras these days are geared toward implanted breasts that need a whole different kind of bra than natural girls.  This bra fits that need.  It is beautiful and sexy while giving support without hard cups.  Fits true to size.,B0000ZFDD4
i just tried it on and it itches already. the side cups are a little big on me. will likely return,B0000ZFDD4
"My wife said she love's the fit and is willing to buy more,thank you Felina for helping me find the correct bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"pretty, comfortable, fits well I love it you can wear it everyday - holds up well, can wash in the washer & hang dry or low dryer",B0000ZFDD4
Fit perfect and it was a good price for the size. It's hard to find bras the exact size I need so I was pleased when this bra fit as expected...,B0000ZFDD4
"No pinching and the cup sits well without awkward lines. I would recommend this for the sexy, robust lady. Great find.",B0000ZFDD4
"It was a little too big for me even though it was my usual size, so I ended up returning it.  It was good quality though and very pretty color.  I was looking for something with a bit more fabric to it but the unlined title should have warned me.  Overall, it's a pretty bra if you're looking for something unlined and no push up but does run a little big.",B0000ZFDD4
Fit exactly right.  Ordered my normal size.  Comfy and cute.  Would recommend.  Don't like having to write long reviews. Bye,B0000ZFDD4
I liked this bra from the beginning but it started to fall apart with the underwire coming out after washing it a few time. Had to purchase again but not the same style.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love this bra!!! SOOOOO comfortable!!!  So difficult to find this type of bra!  Will order more, later.  If you hate padding and can fill your cup, you will like it too.",B0000ZFDD4
"Money Well Spent
I must say that it is a Perfect Fit
Its Comfortable.
incredibility Sexy
No regrets with this perchase",B0000ZFDD4
"I really loved the look of this bra and was so hoping it would fit! However when I tried it on, the cups were simply too large. I'm not sure this is the fault of the bra, though; I suspect that it is simply not the best shape of style for my particular chest. If you have more top-heavy breasts this may work better for you than it did for me.",B0000ZFDD4
one of my clients always finds it hard to find the right bra ... so this was a good find the material she says is a bit thin ... so it doesn't offer much support .. bare that in mind !!!,B0000ZFDD4
The material is fresh and it fits perfectly. I like the way it looks and feels. I will recomned it,B0000ZFDD4
"I bought this to match a pair of panties to make a sexy set, not for comfort. Boy was I surprised when this bra made it's way into my ""comfy bra"" drawer. I think I'll end up with four more of these. They made your girls look great, you feel sexy and it is surprisingly comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
"Band was a little loose on the first clasps, as were the cups. My major complaint is the fact that the straps are quite stiff when you first get this bra, and they like to rub the heck out of your armpit.

Very cute! would definitely go down a band size next time, but keep the same cup size.

Also, the periwinkle is a little more intense of a purple than is let on in this photo.",B0000ZFDD4
I bought the bra for my daughter. She is a curvy girl with slim torso. The bra fits perfect. The overall quality of the bra very good for one exemption. She complains that it a little bit itching in the front. But still she likes it.,B0000ZFDD4
"It is pretty and sexy.

I love the Felina brand... it is consistent. Once you know your size in Felina you can buy different styles same size and it will always fit.

Thanks
Sharon",B0000ZFDD4
"Uncomfortable and you can't tell from the picture but there is no lining or padding,  only lace over the cups.",B0000ZFDD4
"It came a little earlier than expected which was nice, however the fit was not at all like the picture, a little big and I have to wear a tank top to make things stay in place :/",B0000ZFDD4
"This is cute but it's scratchy in all the places you don't want it to be scratchy like the band and the straps. The straps have nude felt-like material for additional durability but I think this is what is part of the problem because the material used is cheap. Anyways, don't buy this one--go to the department store and find another cute one.",B0000ZFDD4
"The color is different and the detail on the straps is soooo feminine.
It seems to run a bit small in the back size.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a very pretty item and quite well-constructed. However the band runs a little small. The dark plum color is lovely and the straps are lacy and attractive without being itchy, and are lined in a plush flannely fabric. I will reorder this item.",B0000ZFDD4
"Felina makes some really great underwires, central gores, and band structures. Of the various brands of bras I have tried, Felina is the only one that creates bras that will perform to the standard that a good fitting bra should on me: stay on with the central gore flush with the breastbone, cups around the breasts, and underwires against the ribs under the breasts WITHOUT the straps on shoulders or band fastened. Seriously, the only brand. They seem to have the perfect structure for people with large, firm, dense, close-set breasts on a narrow frame. I've been fond of various Felina bras in the past. Unfortunately, the cup fabric does not quite perform quite as well. Felina bras tend to expect the vertical center line of your breasts to be farther toward your armpits than they are on me. This seems really odd to me given how well the underwires fit and lay flat. It causes some sagging at the top of the cups and any seaming or cup fabric structure to not line up properly with the breasts. This particular bra has the added drawback of having weird fabric. It's a stretchy mesh with either lace or stitching of some sort in a lace-like pattern. The mesh stretches and conforms to your breasts while the lacy detail prevents the fabric from moving and conforming. Unless you're toting basketballs around, this causes some weird indentation effects where the lacy detail is. Overall, the cons outweighed the pros for me.",B0000ZFDD4
I love it! It can be quite difficult to find cute bras in larger sizes that actually fit right. I am over the moon with this bra!,B0000ZFDD4
"Such a good bra! Looking for a non padded bra for a larger bust isn't easy, but this one fits great and the support is there. Comfortable and all natural :)",B0000ZFDD4
"I got a 32DD and it's tight. I normally wear a 32DDD though. Still looks good. But since it's unlined, it gets itchy after awhile.",B0000ZFDD4
"like other reviewers said, the bra straps are somewhat loose. i did adjust them and it was still too big. It didn't have enough support for me. pretty bra though, but i returned it because of the lack of support",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is really pretty and holds the big puppies firmly in place. Great quality and looks very sexy. I will be buying again,B0000ZFDD4
For a 34DD- this bra fits great- and it's comfy. love it so much im buying another--it's really sexy too,B0000ZFDD4
"So if you are among the overly blessed like myself (34DDD) then you will find that most pretty bras are just not for you. I like this one and even though I ordered the correct size I found myself sort of spilling out of the top ever so often, and really really spilling if I bent over at all. Just becareful maybe order a cup size larger for this particular design?",B0000ZFDD4
"When I first tried on this bra I loved it.  It fit perfectly, gave a smooth line down my back and great support.  I am size 34DD generally.  The straps did feel a bit harder than I would like.  By lunchtime I was compulsively wriggling in it as the elastic around the base of the bra was incredibly scratchy and irritating.  When i took it off and ran my fingers over it i discovered the stitching is done with really course thread and this was the source of my discomfort.  I am a bit sensitive to fabrics and will generally not buy a bra unless it has soft elastic, so it might not bother you.  I do also have to say the fit and look of the bra is fabulous.  I will wear this for outings rather than whole days at work though.  I also bought the Felina lush lace cheeky pany boyleg to match and these are really comfortable, flattering and pretty.",B0000ZFDD4
Fit great around but no support up top.  The lace was too loose at the cleavage area and I felt like I was moving around in it a lot....may try double sided tape to hold it hold it fits the dress I had in mind.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love the look of the bra and when I initially put it on it fit ok, but as the day progressed, I found myself spilling out.  If the cup was darted a little at the top, it would prevent the spillage.",B0000ZFDD4
"this is the perfect bra for those with larger breasts, very comfortable and NOT grandma looking.  It is very supportive.",B0000ZFDD4
the strap are not comfortable at all need to improve it looks great but I gave away the color is nice,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is amazing, it's supportive and super comfortable.  I'm a 36DDD (sometimes a 34) and this fits like a dream.  Also, it looks fantastic on, I will be ordering in more colors!!",B0000ZFDD4
"If you are buying this for a bigger cup size, the straps need to be tightened all the way and the cup stretches as the day goes on and ""the girls"" barely stay in",B0000ZFDD4
It fits good except there still loose space in the front but I love the fit definitely will order more,B0000ZFDD4
"So, why am I happy with this? It is a 36 B, and I pretty much fill it out. As others have mentioned, sheer bras are normally way too large in the cup, usually because they're stretchy. This is not stretchy through the cup, and I couldn't be happier. I'm built lanky: long arms and legs, broad shoulders, small boobs. This does not dig into me, and I don't find it to be itchy. This is working for me. I am so freaking glad it doesn't push my breasts together!!! All that does is make them look smaller, and, well....squished together. How that is supposed to help, I have no idea. Who ever thought that up? This allows them to sit a lot closer to where they want to sit (they tend to point outwards just a bit), however, it DOES GIVE SUPPORT. This is a small miracle. Hats off to Felina. And, thanks to all the previous reviewers whose comments clued me in as to how this would fit!",B0000ZFDD4
"Great usual Felina fit no surprises here. Has a nude colored lining under the lace, looks very nice. Good support, too.",B0000ZFDD4
Hate writing reviews but i like this bra. I love the way I look in this bra. Will order more in different colors.,B0000ZFDD4
The Whole thig was Huge I normally wear a size 38DDD so I figured I'd be fine with a 40DDD but the straps were huge! Even with them tightened all the way it's like they expected my boobs to be a lot closer to my belly button then my shoulders. I had to cut 5 inches off the straps and re-sew them to get it wearable and even then the fabric was so worthless that it did absolutely nothing other than make me not naked.,B0000ZFDD4
I wish the line was more readily available. Been buying Felina for many years. Bras wear very well and never lose fit.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love the design of this bra, but unfortunately they don't have it in my size.  My husband likes it though, so I'm keeping it even though I wear a 32 G bra.  I ordered a 34 around thinking it might fit a little better, but the cup is still much too small..  We like the soft cup though and it's a comfortable bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"I hate how this fits. The shape is off, the sides are too rigid (as the strap pulls up), but the front is too open and loose. Sending it back.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love the fit and style of this bra, the color is also neutral so good under light colors.
Would buy another.",B0000ZFDD4
"I usually wear 34DD but I do wear 32DDD/E in some cases (and in this case). The cups do not cover the entire breast area. From what was pictured, I didn't expect full coverage but this looks nice when put on initially but after 15 mins my boobs are spilling out from the top. The material is very delicate and doesn't appear to be long lasting. It is a very pretty and delicate looking bra but this is just not practical for someone with a larger chest.",B0000ZFDD4
"Couldn't find this brand in my size in the Mall where I live.  I was first introduced to this brand years ago at a large department store.  Glad I found some Felina styles here.  Fits well, though the straps could be a bit wider for the larger sizes.",B0000ZFDD4
Wow. It fits. I love the color and shape. I am excited to wear it. I have been battling with bras lately. Would definitely buy another. Style is very elegant. Doesnt level bulges under clothing.,B0000ZFDD4
Scratchy cheap material and the underwire left a scar on each side of my breast. I find it hard to believe that this is FELINA. Either the quality of Felina has dropped considerably or this is FAKE all together. Save your money!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is beautifully made and quite supportive. I'm large-busted (anywhere between a 32DDD and H, depending on brand/maker) and chose to try a 34DDD for this bra since cups run small on most brands that aren't specifically for large chests, and this item doesn't come larger than DDD. It turns out to be a little large in the cup, which almost never happens to me! But the support seems good and the bra is both delicate and sexy while still providing coverage. I'll be returning for a smaller size.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra!  It fits great and best of all it is really pretty and affordable which is really hard to find as you into larger cup sizes! (34ddd),B0000ZFDD4
"The cup comes JUST above the nipple... but barely.  I've always worn a 36DD in Felina so it's not that I ordered the wrong size. I believe that the bra is just cut particularly low which doesn't look good if you don't have the most remarkable round/perky breasts.  The bra itself is very pretty, however.",B0000ZFDD4
"I really like the style of the bra and the cup sizing.  It looks cute when it's properly fitted but the straps are a little long - I have to tighten them all the way and throughout the day the top part slips down so my boobs start popping outa little which is obviously uncomfortable.  It's still a good bra, I just wish the straps offered a little more support.",B0000ZFDD4
"If only they had them in my size! I am a 34 G, but decided to try the 34 DDD since they don't make this bra in my size. It is just incredibly beautiful- but, alas, it was too small, and I didn't want to have to go to a 36 inch band in order to make the DDD work for me.",B0000ZFDD4
"Nice looking bra. Super sexy, not itchy, boobs look amazing! I will be ordering more because it is so hard to find sexy bras in the larger sizes",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is very nice and good value for money. It fits perfectly, is very comfortable and rather sexy. But I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for those who like more relaxed style of life.",B0000ZFDD4
"Comfortable, but I definitely got a size too big, which is not good because since there is no padding or cups if it is too big it makes your boobs look saggy.",B0000ZFDD4
"I'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment, so this was definitely something different. Straps are nice and thick. Back band is wide. Front portion lays flat underneath bra instead of tilting up. Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might. Will not hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather'. Middle portion does tend to press into the chest. My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays.",B0000ZFDD4
"before I bought this bra, I was used to full cup bras that didn't offer me any comfort; I am between a size 34dd and 34ddd and I am full-busted. after doing a lot of research, I found that demi cup bras were mostly recommended for people with my issues. when I got the bra, it was significantly small in the cup region; I ordered a 34dd. the band could have done well with some elastic or something because it shows through my shirt. when I raise my arms up, the seam from the cups digs into my breasts and creates this odd look. I don't really wear it casually, but it helps under my nicer clothes.",B0000ZFDD4
"I found the band to be a little bit snug, but it otherwise fits pretty much as expected.  However, don't be fooled by the picture for this item.  Unless you have naturally perky breasts or you would actually wear a half size and size down, your breasts are not going to sit that high in the cup.  As with all demi bras, beware: any upper chest side boob fat you may have will be smushed into adorable little rolle, in a most unfortunate and highly visible manner.  Don't buy this bra if you are carrying 20lbs extra or more.  You will not be happy with the results.",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is pretty but not quite as pretty as in the picture. For me, the cup is a little small and I am considering returning or exchanging for a larger size.  The band seems true to size.",B0000ZFDD4
I'm a 32DDD. I like the idea of this bra. It would fit really well if the cups weren't pressing my boobs out. It's too tight! So I would say it runs a cup size smaller. AHHHH it's so beautiful I wish it would fit :(,B0000ZFDD4
"all of the DD I bought have smaller than they should cup sizes when on...bummed. they are pretty. maybe once I lose more weight I'll lose some of that ""filler"" too lol",B0000ZFDD4
"I love the bra's design. The lace is nice and the straps have a very sexy detail. It fits a little small, but I'm dieting, so it will probably fit better in a couple of weeks (fingers crossed). It definitely gives a good lift and push, and who can't use a little of that, amirite ladies?",B0000ZFDD4
"I was so happy to find my size in an unlined demi bra. It fits perfectly , and the lace doesn't wrinkle up under my shirt.",B0000ZFDD4
It's when you wear it yourself that you appreciate how sensual it makes you look 9and feel about yourself). Will buy more,B0000ZFDD4
"The underwire is too high, after a few hours you feel it stabbing the middle of the chest. Otherwise pretty bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"i ordered a 34ddd, which are difficult to find in prettier bras, and it fits true to size.  i would definitely buy another felina bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"Their bras just fit me. I love how they look, I love how they fit. No gapping, bunching, and no popover up top :)",B0000ZFDD4
"I have trouble finding pretty bras in my size... big boobs skinny waist... This brand always has something cute, I ordered the black and the hot pink adorable!!! I love them , super flattering, great fit, and really pretty and girly! Only issue I have is the lace is very itchy after a while ... but aside from that I love them!",B0000ZFDD4
"Unfortunately, I ordered the incorrect (too large) size, so I really can't speak to it. I am not saying anything negative; the wrong size was my error. I returned the bra. If there were a way to choose NO STARS, that is what I would do.",B0000ZFDD4
Fits perfect and looks awesome. Very comfortable and husband approves. Will buy another one in a different color. Hope it lasts long.,B0000ZFDD4
"Perfect. Fits well and is comfortable. The fabric is flimsy, but it is very supportive while you are wearing it.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra so much. It doesn't give a strange shape to my chest like some unlined bras with underwire do. It's super comfortable and fit perfectly. I got it in City Rose, and it's more of a bright pink but I still love it. Planning on getting more in different colors.",B0000ZFDD4
"Great bra, super sexy. It doesn't give much support to DD cup but fits nice and it's perfect to use it with dresses.",B0000ZFDD4
the metal under wire jabs into my chest and if I knew this I would have never bought it. I would return no but I have wore it for to long. I don't want them to sell to someone else and have then get my tit sweat all over there's.,B0000ZFDD4
"I love demi bras now that I've been introduced to them.  I always thought that as a member of the big boobie club I need a ""full coverage"" bra, but I always had gaps and space at the tops of the cups with them.  With the demi bras, the shape more closely fits my actual boobs, and is much more flattering.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have 40dd breasts and it so hard to find a pretty bra that looks sexy, but still holds the girls in.
This is perfect as it is a mixture of balconette and demi so you get some cleavage without everything falling out like most of the plunge bras.. I went back and bought in it ivory as well! I a hooked.",B0000ZFDD4
I've been fitted recently so I know my size. This size is all wrong. I wish I could post a pic. It looks like the right size but it's like one extra inch of fabric was included around the boob area that I could literally fold over itself to show extra fabric that doesn't need to be on the bra to make it fit,B0000ZFDD4
"I am a triple D. I tried this bra, thinking it would be silky and smooth for long days at work. Wrong. Double d's are way too big, let alone my girls. See ya!",B0000ZFDD4
As a sissy it's so important to feel feminine when cross dressing. My breast inserts fit quite nicely into the cup. I love the pink color which is my favorite color!!! I love prancing around and feeling dainty in this bra!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"Finally, a cute bra in a larger cup size!  The only complaint I have is that the underwires tend to dig into my sides if I wear it for to long, but that means 18 plus hours.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have been having trouble for a long time finding a bra that fits nicely and looks nice! I have issues all the time with the ladies spilling out but I haven't had that issue at all with this one, it's nice and comfy (even for a bra with an underwire) and it looks so good! It separates nicely so I don't have a uniboob under my shirt, also even gives some good jiggle support. My boyfriend loves it too, I want to order more!",B0000ZFDD4
I love the unlined feel and it really fits perfectly! Better then any other bra I own. It's still super supportive but without the extra padding if you are larger chested and don't need it.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is lined. I'm not sure why it's listed as unlined - I thought the lace would be sheer but there is a thick nude colored lining. I don't think the pictures represent the actual bra well at all.
It's average in construction and is average looking, but certainly incorrectly advertised.",B0000ZFDD4
I got a 36ddd and it is perfect. It doesn't feel like I have anything on and it is so pretty!,B0000ZFDD4
"You will look super sexy in this bra!  It is comfortable to wear, as well.  The quality is great and you will love the way you look!!",B0000ZFDD4
fits great love the sexy lace of it and the size was perfect! so hard to find a 36 larger than D and this 36 DDD is Awesome. Have had it for some time now and its still holding up great.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra runs suuuuuper small.  Make sure you order up a cup and bands size.  If I had gotten a proper size, I may have had a better review :(",B0000ZFDD4
"Fabulous bra for those who have a fairly full bust but don't care for the ""harness"" (""full coverage"") feel. Has the one issue that all underwire has.. if you wear it too long (18 hours or more), it starts to feel like you are displacing ribs.. but that is because your ribs aren't made to take that kind of hard surface pressure for that kind of time. If you need to wear a bra of some kind 24/7.. get a ""soft"" bra for evenings at home, and sleeping.. this one is GREAT for daytime.. This thing will keep that cleavage UP and natural as it is gonna get with everyday support. No, you don't want to go jogging in it, but it isn't meant for that. AND its pretty! Just an extra added bonus!!",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra fit nothing like the Wacoal and Natori 32DDD bras I purchased from Nordstrom.  I won't say it was too large, or too small because that wouldn't be accurate.  It just wasn't *right*....",B0000ZFDD4
This bra was perfect! I normally am hesitant to order bras due to sizing and being disappointed but I must say I have no complaints. Not only is it a pretty bra but it lifts and gives the perfect hold. I ordered it in a black 34D and will order again in different colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"I got this in both the black and the ivory, and I love them both. When I first went to wear them, they were a little scratchy in the beginning, but they became more comfortable and now are my favorite sexy bras. The part I enjoy most is the straps with the ribbon detailing... if the straps peek out, they look so pretty!",B0000ZFDD4
"I gave this product 5 stars because it's a beautiful as it is comfortable.
It gives the support that I need with under-wires without the bulkiness of cushioning (that manufacturer's stubbornly put in all bras, regardless of the fact that a 40D is already bigger than most of us want anyway), it's comfortable to wear all day, and it's just transparent enough to drive my bf crazy with anticipation.
I'd definitely recommend this bra in the size I ordered, though I can't speak for the other sizes.",B0000ZFDD4
It's not itchy at all!! It has wide straps so it brings out the shoulders and it is quite comfy so I love it!!,B0000ZFDD4
"The Bra looks exactly as photgraphed. However, I was expecting a soft feel instead the fabric is very rough around the the underwire and even the cups. the straps are lined so they were ok. Couldn't wear this for more than a few hours. I donated it to Good Will",B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is pretty, and I do love the ""bounce"" that a good balconette bra gives, but the straps on this bra stretched out almost immediately, resulting in me constantly pulling up fallen-down straps all day.

I wouldn't recommend this bra is you're a large-breasted woman.",B0000ZFDD4
"I like lace bras, but this one failed in a number of ways.
The lace doesn't stretch, and is VERY scratchy.
The underwire pokes.
The strap adjustments are difficult to reach because they're in the back, and only half of the strap stretches. The adjustment portion didn't adjust short enough for my small frame, so the straps were too loose.
This is an uncomfortable, poor-fitting, and hard-to-adjust bra.
The only thing good about it is that it's cute - but that's not enough!",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits Perfect!  I am fairly small but it fits like a glove.  Its comfortable sheer & sleek.  I highly recommend if you want something comfy, sheery & sleek.",B0000ZFDD4
"In the interest of helping others...I'm 5'6"" and 134 lbs (yeah, I know...working on it!). I'm a true 32DD in most brands. My ribcage actually measures at 31.5"".

First things first: this bra is beautiful, sexy, not the least bit trashy and I have been waiting for it to get marked down (THANKS AMAZON!!!). I purchased it in the black and its lovely. It has a lovely lace overlay and the cups are unlined. The seam you see in the pix is comfortable and doesn't telegraph through to a t-shirt/tank top.  The cups give a nice rounded shape and come up high enough to not have any quad-boob or spillage after I bend over to pick up a wiggly toddler. The straps seem to do a nice job of supporting my 'girls' without cutting into my shoulders. The back has three hooks. The band is soft/not itchy and seems slightly small. I LOVE that the underwire doesn't come up too high. It hits at a very comfortable spot on the sides. For some reason, where the underwire meets in the front REALLY pinches. I really want this bra to work so I'm exchanging it for a 34D in hopes that its sister size will be a GO. Fingers crossed!

UPDATE:
Ordered the 34D. THe band was more comfortable (perhaps slightly loose?) but the cups gapped on the top. I must be fuller on the bottom.  It made the girls point down and out. Very sad, indeed. Sending it back. It is beautiful...though. Maybe for someone else with a different shape.",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra is gorgeous! I just had a breast augmentation and my DR wants me in an underwire bra with no lining or push up. I bought on size larger and it's doing the trick! Once my breasts settle and I'm able to really go bra shopping, I will be buying this bra again in my size and in multiple colors ;) the straps have a nice detail and the lace is sexy. It's a little itchy where the 2 wires touch my cleavage, but I'm hoping thats because its a little too big.",B0000ZFDD4
What a beautiful color and the fit is great.  I love to have a wide selection of color in my undies and this bra is beautiful.  The quality is excellent and the price was great.  I wear a 34DDD and am glad AMAZON carries all the things I desire.,B0000ZFDD4
"The lace is stiff and scratchy, the fit was not good for me. Overall, very uncomfortable - I'm returning it.",B0000ZFDD4
"Just way too much fabric for my tastes and big straps, 3 hook back. Not happy with it. Would not recommend.",B0000ZFDD4
"This fits wonderfully and is very flattering, definitely a great deal!  I will be ordering more soon, hopefully in different colors!",B0000ZFDD4
"These bras look as beautiful as they look in the picture shown.  However, they are cut a bit shorter at the top. Although not padded, because of  having strategically positioned seems one can wear them under T shirts and thin sweaters and not worry about revealing too much.",B0000ZFDD4
I found the bra to be very well made for the price. It was comfortable to wear and pretty to look at. Who could ask for more?,B0000ZFDD4
I would have given a five except I wish I knew the full figure runs big. Have others by them and they are well made and beautiful.,B0000ZFDD4
"Love the bra, fits nicely. Appreciate that it has 3 hooks, so good support without unnecessary 'contour' materials.  Thank you!",B0000ZFDD4
"The picture is small enough that I did not notice that the strap was not all black, I was very dissapointed. I can still wear it but I REALLY wanted an ALL black bra.",B0000ZFDD4
This is a good pick for a first time bra purchase online. I like the straps on the outside. I only hope it will last  for awhile.,B0000ZFDD4
"Liked the bra, it gives supports, I could where blouses that are wider on the shoulders but, it scratchs on the side arm pit a little bit.",B0000ZFDD4
"I really like this bra. The band was a little too tight for me but it's nothing a cheap bra extender can't help. Other than that, it's a sexy bra that I really like the look of.",B0000ZFDD4
34dd lilac bra. Super pretty  and feminine. I want to get all the other colors now. And yes it fits just fine.,B0000ZFDD4
I am a 34ddd and have a hard time fitting into pretty bras.  This one fits perfectly and is pretty:) just like the picture,B0000ZFDD4
"i'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs and this just didn't fit right.  Maybe it's made for a bustier women I guess",B0000ZFDD4
"The wires stabs me awful and is a smaller fit than a normal 34DD. It is very pretty, but that doesn't matter if I cannot wear the item.",B0000ZFDD4
"I am always leery of buying bras online, it is hard for me to find a bra that fits correctly, is comfortable and does what I want it to do even in stores. This bra does all three plus is very sexy! I am a 40 C and the size is perfect! I would recommend to anyone!",B0000ZFDD4
I love the color and the fit its kinda itchy but after you wash it a few times its perfect,B0000ZFDD4
"I just got this bra today and tried it on right away and I love it! I have a hard time finding the right cup size. I wear a 38 DDD. Victoria secret and Frederick of Holly Wood do not have my size so when I found the larger sizes on Amazon I was excited to buy one. This bra seemed really thin when I took it out of the bag but its beautiful and make my boobs really perky just like I was looking for. Grant it I have really full boobs, so it fills out the bra nicely. The bra is very comfortable as well. The only thing is the band is a little tight I wish I went a tad bit bigger on the band. I will definitely be buying another one!",B0000ZFDD4
"I originally purchased a 32DD, but when I received it was two small. I returned it the same day for a 32DDD. I'm not sure what size this corresponds with, but I wear a 32F.

It is the best fitting bra I've had in years.

I'm not sure about wear and tear, but I'm sure with hand washing it will definitely last a while.",B0000ZFDD4
"I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D  the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides.  The cups were just a TAD too big, and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that, being a 38, the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size....cup size was alright, but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide!  It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center!  No thanks!  Plus, it pushed really hard into my sternum!  The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable, I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is the second time I purchased a bra on Amazon and the sizing is not the same as the bra in store. I got fitted for Felina bras and was told that I am a 32DDD in their bras. When I tried the bra on in store, it fit perfectly so I decided to order on Amazon because the store price was way more expensive. This bra has so much space in the bust area that I cannot possibly wear it as the 'girls' will jiggle with any step that I make. Terrible!",B0000ZFDD4
but i liked it. it makes her chest looklike one of those marie antoinette women. we had to exchange for a larger size though.,B0000ZFDD4
"I'm leery of bras without shaping and structure these days, but this does the job without any of it.  Pretty, comfortable, and supportive.  I will buy this again.",B0000ZFDD4
"size-fits-lightweight, so ideal for summer. I do not feel comfortable from-zi coarse material, rubbing the skin. Perhaps after a few washings will be softer.",B0000ZFDD4
"Very pretty and well made for sure, however, the bra is very wide so not good for narrow backs. Straps cut into tenter skin near under arm area.",B0000ZFDD4
I love this brand of bras here at Her room.com/Amazon. This bra was priced under $20.00. I like the fit. I really like the style too! The material is nice. I had to go up in inches around to give me room for bloating. The cup size is accurate.,B0000ZFDD4
"Finally a sexy beautiful bra for a woman with bigger breasts that doesn't look like an iron lung. It's comfortable, gives plenty of support and doesn't have straps and a back that are the size of your wrists. Kudos Felina",B0000ZFDD4
"THIS BRA IS AMAZING.
FIVE STARS NO TEN WELL DESERVED. WHY?
BECAUSE I SAID SO LOL. JP.
HERE IS WHY.
ONE I HAVE BEAUTIFUL BIG BOOBS I WEAR A 2
36DDD & IT'S AS U KNOW SOOO HARD TO FIND A BRA...THAT FITS ME LET ALONE A HOT CLASSY ONE. SECOND THIS BRA GOES RETAIL FOR $130 GIVE OR TAKE. I KNOW CUZ I HAVE OWNED THIS BRA BEFORE AND I GOT THIS BRA FOR A STEAL.
THIRD IT'S SOFT AND CAN BE WORN TO WORK AS LINGERIE OR WITH C THRU SHIRTS OR SEXY DRESSES AND IT ALL LOOKS GOOD.  Versatile. Buy it today.

Bella D ",B0000ZFDD4
"Fits perfectly in the band but the cups are a strange shape. It would be too small for me at a 32DD, but the 32 DDD was just a tiny bit loose. I wish I could get it hemmed or something. It is a really pretty bra.",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra looks lovely on. The strap design gives the effect of skin peeking through, & the shape it gives is surprisingly natural, I.e., more of a sloping, projected look as opposed to very round & boosted up. So that's either a plus or minus depending on your preference. But the straps are very thin & fairly rough on the sides; I found they cut in after more than a couple hours of wear.",B0000ZFDD4
Cute but a little itchy! Looks good for short term use. Size is accurate. Color is cream- very cute. Would buy again,B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra it's amazingly comfortable along with giving me a great lift. Cleavage looks amazing! Hubby likes it also ;-) its pretty. And been in the was many times and the wire is not coming out its not worn still looks great! I'm getting another one!,B0000ZFDD4
It's hard for you to find sexy natural looking bras when you are a DD. This one is super sexy. I ordered a cup size smaller since I was going for a sexier look and less coverage.,B0000ZFDD4
I was pleasantly surprised at this bra. I got it just for fun to wear but it is actually comfortable to wear for any occasion. but does run a bit small in the cup size if you like full coverage bras.,B0000ZFDD4
"The fit is terrible.  The narrow straps cut into my shoulders, but if they are loosened, the cups don't provide the proper amount of support.  You must be the exact right size to wear this bra...comfortably.",B0000ZFDD4
Very nice and sexy I ill by again I recommend this product confortable price is exelent  fit and material nice,B0000ZFDD4
Very sexy and functional. This product is also very reasonably priced. Great value and a great bra - thank you!,B0000ZFDD4
"I chose 3 stars b/c it is super pretty and I just love the look and feel of it. Unfortunately, it creates red marks on my skin on the sides of my body and is imprinted there for a while and sometimes in the center between the breasts. It is super comfy and I like it a lot but if I had the choice to buy it again, I probably wouldn't.",B0000ZFDD4
I have purchased this in another color before - this is a great item and the price was better than any department store in my area - I absolutely will buy again ..,B0000ZFDD4
"This is a pretty good bra, especially for the price.
But one this I have to say is it was not true to size.
Maybe this is because I have never owned a bra like this so I just didn't know that it runs bigger in size.
But the cup was a full size too big, the band on the other hand fit perfectly.
Otherwise I was satisfied.
Even thinking about giving it another go in a smaller size, it's not to expensive so if that doesn't work then what am I really losing right?
It's fairly comfortable, but a little itchy after a while.
But comfy to sleep in.",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is very feminine! And very pretty.  Fits just right too.  I would definitely but it in more colors.,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra is gorgeous. Only problem I have with it is the size. I usually wear a 34 C, and this bra is uncomfortably tight. I don't know if it is cut wrong, or if it's just because the material isn't very stretchy.

I will be exchanging it for a 36. Hopefully that solves the problem.",B0000ZFDD4
"I wear a 38C Bra size, and this bra fits the bill!!! Love it!  I just ordered another one.  I would highly recommend this bra.  It is very sexy, and comfortable.

Update:

After wearing this bra for a day, it's NOT comfortable.  I would not recommend it all, and I have returned the other one that was ordered, and the one I kept goes in the ""Not form fitting, and comfortable"" draw.  I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead, so far it is very comfortable, and fits nicely to the breasts.  I will be ordering another pair!",B0000ZFDD4
I was surprised by the high quality and great fit of this bra for a really affordable price.  Lots of detailing not really shown in the photo.,B0000ZFDD4
"I write this review for the DDD's, this bra is pretty but no support for big bust, I guess that's what you get for the price!",B0000ZFDD4
"This stunning bra is every girl's dream bra. It has the right perks for any bra to have, from being comfortable to the adjustability. It can match the likes of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coobie-Strappy-V-Neck-Lace-Trim-Bras/dp/B008D2J9QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Bras</a>as this bra is like nothing else.",B0000ZFDD4
"There are many kind of bra out there, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coobie-Strappy-V-Neck-Lace-Trim-Bras/dp/B008D2J9QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Bras</a>; but then there is this item from Felina Women. This bra has both style and fabrics going for it.  You will disappointed from this item. I assure you.",B0000ZFDD4
"I am a true 32DD and this bra is very beautiful and true to size!  It is delicate, while still being supportive.  Great buy!",B0000ZFDD4
"The first thing every woman need is confort. If I could buy more, I would buy a dozen. Nobody would regret such purchase, so I really recommend this tem.",B0000ZFDD4
"Excellent quality, comfortable and very sexy. When buying was not sure because it seemed to have little support for people of large breasts, but besides having good support is very sexy.",B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra, very soft and comfortable.  I loved the feel of it, looks great, just needs a pad on the inside of the cup for concealment...of certain areas.  Other than that I have no complaints and I will be buying from this vendor again very soon!",B0000ZFDD4
I love this bra! It is comfortable and fits very well. I plan to order more. It arrived much sooner than promised.,B0000ZFDD4
"I never write reviews, never, really. This bra was just great. I ordered a 34C and found it fit well. Stiff on the sides, but necessarily so as it is somewhat of a pushup/demi.",B0000ZFDD4
I love these bras. I've bought them in all different colors. The only thing that I can complain about is the fact that the underwire tears through the fabric. I've had to sew all of them. They're thin and comfortable. I'm quite busty with a small rib cage and it's hard for me to find bras that fit but these are my favorite.,B0000ZFDD4
"After I bought the Felina Helena (which I was completely in love with), I also bought this one because it came in more colors for my size. I wear a 32DD, and I often have trouble finding bras in my size that are still pretty and bras in my size where the cups aren't too far apart. This bra is just as great as the Helena. It is gorgeous, comfortable, and supportive with cups that are close together so that I'm not spilling out between them. If you are a smaller woman with a larger chest, this (as well as other Felina bras) should work very well for you.",B0000ZFDD4
"Online this Bra looks Delicious! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable. The problem?
I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old ""Felina|Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra.""
They, I, didn't feel comfortable, nor safe walking or playing around in it.  I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies, cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady!
YOu dig?",B0000ZFDD4
As soon as I put this bra on I never wanted to take it off!  I wear a 36DD and its hard to find a bra that makes me feel this hot & sexy and still be supportive and comfortable!!  I want it in every color now!! Love love love!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross.  This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night.  Also it fit kinda weird.  For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast.  (It was probably only noticable to me, but still, did not make me feel sexy.",B0000ZFDD4
"this bra is very supportive, and finally I feel sexy in it. it fits like a balconette, however keeps the girls up and in place",B0000ZFDD4
"The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to. They are a bit roomy, I'm disappointed.",B0000ZFDD4
Love this brand Felina makes the best bra for chesty women who do not want to wear granny bras. i have worn this style for years. Firm underwire give a great lift.,B0000ZFDD4
unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt. :(,B0000ZFDD4
"This bra fits, looks sexy, feels good and was just an all round wonderful find and good purchase.  Get one if you can.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a beautiful bra, but the support just is not there! I am a 34 DDD and I just didn't feel ""locked and loaded!""",B0000ZFDD4
"First let me say that this bra came in really fast, even though it was the holiday season! It was predicted to come in after 6 days at the earliest, but I got in only 4 days!

I ordered it in my size, 34DD, and even though it's an uncommon size, the bra fit perfectly. The band is snug all the way around and sits flush against even the front part of my chest. But there's still breathing room for me, too--exactly the way a bra should be. The cups on this one aren't molded, but they hold everything in place and nothing spills out or bulges. The material on the inside is fine, not scratchy or irritating. And of course, it looks cute on the outside, which makes things even better!",B0000ZFDD4
"I was so impressed when I tried on this bra.  I am a 36C, and this is sized just right.  It makes you feel sexy and pretty with the way it lifts and holds without squeezing- like the gentle touch from an adoring lover.  I totally recommend it!",B0000ZFDD4
This bra is cute and arrived quickly--unfortunately it runs a little small in the band size and is very uncomfortably scratchy due to the material used.,B0000ZFDD4
This is a good looking bra.  When Felina state it is for a full bust I get one cup size smaller than I would on other bras.  I recommend this product.,B0000ZFDD4
"It's comfortable and soft, but priced high compared to the duration of validity
Used only three times in the last time was outdated and very bad

I purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two years

Dislikes",B0000ZFDD4
"I would totally recommend this product. The fabric is soft. I was a little nervous about ordering a bra without having tried it on, but I was very pleasantly surprised when it not only fit perfectly, it is also very comfortable.",B0000ZFDD4
"I did not like the seam placement in the cups....it vastly took away from the style.
The lace was very pretty though.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a great bra. Most Bra's at my size cause ""Double booby"" or lines mid boob leaving me in the ""Mom bra"" realm. This is a demi but with perfect support, and sexy!",B0000ZFDD4
"I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with. I did this because of the price and it was money wasted. The bras fit as if it had been worn. Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right. So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist. Useless. Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill. Bad purchase. Bad fit. Pretty but not practical. I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well, this was not made for D+ women.",B0000ZFDD4
"I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long.  I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose.  I've probably only had that problem with 1% of all the bras I've ever bought, and sadly this was one of them.  The cups run generously sized (which for me, as a D/DD usually is a positive thing, but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down).  The overall design was cute, but the odd sizing made it a no-go.",B0000ZFDD4
"The material is super itchy and scratchy. The support is decent.  I wouldn't be able to wear this bra for an extended period of time.  Maybe just a short work day or something.  Kind of a let down. I was excited to get the bra after reading the reviews.  But this fell way, way short of my expectations. Oh well.",B0000ZFDD4
It is so hard to find a demi bra in 38DDD first of all. Second this fits amazing!! It is cute and so comfortable! The bottom does roll under a bit but not bad just if I am lounging on the couch and up and down alot. I am not sure how well its going to hold up over time (I don't think it's going to be more than a year) but totally worth the $$$$$ !!!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"I purchased my first couple Felina bras this past week. Previously I had been fitted at a department store and had tried on similar, yet different, bras from the Felina family. I decided on a whim to order them online. When they arrived I quickly tried to get the trying on portion over with. I can know say I am definitely a Felina bra fan! I am a 34D and for me the unlined versions gave good and comfortable support, while still being just sexy enough so you still get the feeling of being sexy because your undergarments are so pretty and you know you look good with them on. Highly recommend for women with cup sizes D and above because the fit is slightly big, made to be filled out. They arrived very quickly as well which was very nice.",B0000ZFDD4
"Wife loves the fit and full underwire support that lifts and separates her natural 36D frame.  I love the way she looks in them.  We bought grape, blue, and pink.  She likes them better than the hyped VS bras.  Comfortable enough to wear everyday, all day.  Bras have held up well to repeated washings.  Unlined cups so slightly minimizes bust.",B0000ZFDD4
"I do realize it's unlined, however the bra does not give any support at all. The color which I choose was beige, and I liked that wasn't just one shade of beige, but it had another hue of beige which made the bra pretty. If you want one with more support, don't purchase this one. This bra is good for just hanging around bra.",B0000ZFDD4
This is a great bra.  I love the way it makes a 34DD still look pretty and delicate.  Will definitely order again.  True to size.,B0000ZFDD4
"I almost liked this bra, but the straps won't shorten up enough. Even when I adjust them to their shortest they're much too long for me. This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking! Maybe I'm just built strangely, but I wasn't able to wear this bra. It is pretty though.",B0000ZFDD4
"The underwire fit well, but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive. I had to send them both back.",B0000ZFDD4
"I struggled with myself for a while before making this purchase. I didn't need a lilac colored lace bra. No one does. A bra, yes. A lace bra, certainly. White, nude or black -- all fine, practical colors. But lavender? What case can you make for beauty alone? I couldn't, other than that I loved the way it looked on the model and decided to chance that it might look pretty decent on yours truly. It did and does. The fit is excellent and it's well made and it LOOKS GORGEOUS. The color is deep but not too intense, a blurred, soft-focus lavender. GLAD, GLAD, GLAD. Indulge!",B0000ZFDD4
OMG I love this Bra its perfect and very Pretty!!!!! I will be ordering more of this bra but in different colors!!!!,B0000ZFDD4
"I love this bra, it is very comfortable and you can't beat the price for the support. The bra runs true to size I ordered a 32DD and love the long straps to allow adjustment. The back of the bra is nice and low so you can wear tank tops without showing your bra (like my Bali minimizer's do). I would recommend this bra especially for augmented breasts. Finding a bra for fake boobs is so difficult! Felina brand makes it easier!",B0000ZFDD4
"Quite flimsy. Doesnt give any support.
The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt.",B0000ZFDD4
My bra fit exactly like the pictures that Asia shared in 2017. I wear a 32DDD and this bra made me look like I had old lady boobs. Very unflattering and disappointing. It feels like it would be comfortable if the straps could tighten enough to hold my breast where a bra should but this fit like a bra that you might find at a dollar store. If you have bigger breast I wouldn't even risk wasting your time with this bra.,B0000ZFDD4
Product is no where like what is pictured. Cheap quality material and sizing inaccurate,B0000ZFDD4
"Well... I love the feel (thin-ness) and look of this bra. I wear a 36ddd. The issue I have is that the sew connecting the nude liner and lace is ehh.. not great. I suppose it would sit better if I went a cup size down to dd, but usually dd is a tad too small. I guess I am somewhere in between a ddd and a dd? My other ddd cups don't sag though. I like the bra for the price, but it would be 10x better if the liner was sewn better to the lace.",B0000ZFDD4
"This is a kid bra, extremely small, picture is misleading as it looks padded in the pic",B0000ZFDD4
"Very pretty. The band is little tighter than my other 32h bras, but still fits ok. I think it will be great for summer! I also bought matching panty",B0000ZFDD4
Literally the exact same bra from VS for a fraction of the cost!,B0000ZFDD4
Normally purchase directly through Felina.  This amazon offer provided the same product/same quality and fit at a considerable savings.,B0000ZFDD4
"Great thong to wear under exercise clothes. Doesn't move, long lasting through many washings. 1 less star because I noticed that the quality on my recent order was not quite as good as in years past. Runs a little small.",B0000ZESGM
"The sizes must run a bit big, because this thing looks ridiculous on me. Also, the butterfly on the back does not look as good as the picture. Fabric quality is so-so.",B0000ZESGM
"I'm in the middle of a drastic weight loss and didn't want to invest in bras that would not fit a short time later.  Someone suggested these bras and I love them.  They are comfortable and easy to wash and will be with me for while until I'm ready to buy ""real"" lingerie.",B0000ZECF4
This is the only bra I wear....comfy and easy to put on and take off....no hooks.,B0000ZECF4
"I love this bra.  I have some in nylon.  The only problem is that even though I ordered it in the same size, it seems to be smaller, or tighter.  Maybe it's the material.  Also why don't larger sizes come in more than one color?",B0000ZECF4
MY WIFE LOVES IT AND THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS!!!!!!!!,B0000ZECF4
"I have worn tis bra for over 10 years.  Because I have fibromyalgia (pain throughout my whole body - cannot take tight clothing at all this bra is ideal for me.  They last for a very long time, are well made and are perfect for my body problems.",B0000ZECF4
The bra is great.  The fabric is too thin to wear under a T-shirt.  Very comfortable.  I wear 40C.,B0000ZECF4
A truly comfortable bra for large breasted women.,B0000ZECF4
Comfortable and long lasting.  Replacing one I have had for several years.  Great travel bra.,B0000ZECF4
This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned. It looks and feels like a half-camisole. No wires. No pinches anywhere. Just pure comfort. I am on my second one and tend to keep buying.,B0000ZECF4
"I have arthritis in my back.  I wear a B cup so I'm not as big as the photo indicates.  This bra is so comfortable.  It eliminates the pressure and resulting pain I get with regular bras, no matter how loosely I wear them.  It's also great on days when it's difficult to reach back to hook a bra.  This is the only bra I wear any more.",B0000ZECF4
"would love to be able to review the product, but my elderly mother it was bought for couldn't get it over her head!",B0000ZECF4
"These are a great bra for sports, work or anytime.  They are extremely durable.",B0000ZE858
I really like the fit of this bra.,B0000ZE858
"The most important thing was that I didn't have spill over, I really love that part. The worst is the fact that the padded part of the straps is not long enough by the time I adjust them to the right position it is where the straps are joined and it lands right on a very uncomfortable place on my shoulder. I do like how the straps are set in and non-strectch.",B0000ZE858
The support of this bra is great.  Depending on your shirt cut it could be worn as an everyday bra for excellent lift and support.  Extremely pleased with bra.,B0000ZE858
"Third bra I have bought in this style,  I like the comfort and fit.  The local stores did not stock this so I ordered on-line and saved $17.",B0000ZE858
I have tried several others and this is still the best sports bra I have ever found.,B0000ZE858
Wouldn't call a 34C a plus size but who cares.  Wonderful for golf and most sports.,B0000ZE858
"I've been wearing this model of bra daily for almost 10 years. In the last 2years ish the quality is starting to drop.  The fit is still great, and the ""lift"" really does make you look slightly thinner. The last bra I got lasted about 3 weeks before the wire started to poke me under the arm.  The bra I bought about three months ago lasted several months, but I feel it still failed prematurely.  Before the last couple of years a bra would last about a year.",B0000ZE858
"I bought 4 sports bras at one time and this was the biggest ""No"" in the bunch. The band was too tight and the cups too larger. If it helps, I wear a 38DDD and that's what size I ordered.",B0000ZE858
It's hard to find good bras for large chests. This is one of them. Didn't need to adjust all day.,B0000ZE858
Great support and fit as expected.,B0000ZE858
"I bought this bra for a backpack trip. I needed support and something to dry quick. This bra is ugly. BUT it works! I bought many styles, this one and 3 others made the cut. This bra had the best support and most days dried by the time I went to take it off. My husband and I laughed about the look, but the bra did the best job.",B0000ZE858
Straps too long and no adjusters,B0000ZE858
It works for what I wanted but with a surprise. This comfortable bra has great lift. It's better than my nice expensive underwire bras for lift. I'm in my 50s and very large breasted and there's no shadow here! I love this bra so much I wish they came in more colors because this is going to be my everyday bra not just for exercising but for I'm beautiful outfits too. Just be careful that the bra comes up higher than many low cut tops.,B0000ZE858
Love the bra ! Works great for me !,B0000ZE858
The shape of the cups gives the old fashion rocket boobs.,B0000ZE858
Very comfortable and keeps you cool.  I wear these all the time and not just for excercise.,B0000ZE858
The whole bra covers up more of my chest than I'd like but other than that it's good and does the job comfortably.,B0000ZE858
Fit perfectly.  The underwire pokes occasionally when I move the wrong way.  Very comfortable and supportive for the large woman.,B0000ZE858
"Wires tend to poke you, but it's probably my size not the bra",B0000ZE858
"Loved the bra, however, less than a year later and the strap has broken.
I bought two. One in March of 2016, (the wire broke on that one) and another in July of 2016, which has a broken strap.",B0000ZE858
"I'm giving this 3 stars because it does actually fit nicely however it is definitely not high impact, especially for a chesty gal. The cups are made of very thin material, not my style, it's going back. If you like thin, then yes I'd recommend but if you need support this isn't for you.",B0000ZE858
Very supportive and comfortable to wear.,B0000ZE858
"I've been wearing this type of bra for a long, long time now. I love the Lunaire bra. It gives me the support I need and it is cotton so it's
easy to wash.",B0000ZE858
The bra is exactly as I expected.  Fits perfect and provides the necessary support.  The only complaint is that the hooks scratch my back.  The fabric doesn't cover the hooks enough and its a tad scratchy on my back.  I'm hoping with a few washes that it will go away.,B0000ZE858
comfortable and keeps everything under control!,B0000ZE858
"This is my second bra just like this one. It fits so well and I have a terrible time finding a bra that fits (34F). It comes up pretty high on the neckline, but I like that it covers everything. I don't generally wear it as a sports bra as it's not supportive enough for me to run, but I love it as an everyday bra.",B0000ZE858
I love this bra but the under wire is too long in the front thus it sticks out when wearing a t-shirt. thus I removed the wire and Love the bra this way.,B0000ZE858
"Band width way too small.  Otherwise, would have worked.",B0000ZE858
This is a nice full coverage bra.,B0000ZE858
To be perfectly honest I like wearing this bra much more than my more expensive Wacoal sports bra.  At size 38G it is very hard to find a bra that can control the bounce and for me this one is the best out of all that I have tried.  Nicely separates the girls and supports them well for my weekend 5k races.,B0000ZE858
"One of the most comfortable sports bras I have ever used! Fits true to size and is very supportive through high impact aerobic activity.
I am very happy with this bra.",B0000ZE858
"I just pulled this bra out of the bag and put it on. I normally wear a 44DDD but ordered a 46DDD. I probably could have gone down a cup size but I like the extra room. This bra is not flattering but looks okay under a t shirt. That being said, THIS BRA IS SUPER COMFY. I bought this more for around the house on days I don't really want to wear a bra and I think this will be perfect.",B0000ZE858
"I have been buying this bra for years.  These are my 4 and 5th ones.  Unfortunately, the bra has changed and not for the better with regard to my body.  First, there are 3 not 4 hooks on band.  I am a 36DD and the band is very impt to me for support.  3 hooks provides me less control.  The side panels are now made without cotton.  Again, this makes the band less supportive although it is suppose to be more moisture wicking...I can't really tell.  Lastly, I have NEVER had issues with underwire bras.  Noe the left cup wire shifts so sometimes it pokes me (right where I have had surgery).  I think the fabric is thinner allowing the wire to poke more.  I will keep these bras, but not buy them again.",B0000ZE858
"It's difficult for me to find a high impact sports bra that fits my 34 DDD size.  I was hoping this bra would be the answer to my problems.  Unfortunately, the bra is too tight around my ribcage and it isn't very comfortable. I'm also disappointed in the seam that goes across the cup of the bra. The seam is visible underneath my workout tops.  Darn.",B0000ZE858
Fit well...wires poked out after first use and stabbed me. Not for people who actually work out.,B0000ZE858
I have owned this style before. It has been discontinued by the Mfg. So I was thrilled to find this.,B0000ZE858
Only one I like for my 34G size. I work out 6 days a week at age 73.,B0000ZE858
"Currently, this is the only bra that fits me perfectly.  I love it. Great support, no overflow.  However, I wish there was a T-Shirt version without seams.",B0000ZE858
"I just love this bra! I'm plus size,and wear a triple D,so I need an underwire. My issues with many other bras are,the underwire hurts under my breasts and on the sides under my arms. Also the straps always slide down my shoulders. This bra doesn't do any of that. I really don't even notice I'm wearing an underwire,and the straps stay up. It's very surportive ! I'm really happy with it,so I bought another one. It's true to size fits me perfect,I would recommend this bra",B0000ZE858
"Very uncomfortable & runs small. All my bras are 38C and thats what i ordered, its so tight i couldn't wear it longer then 10 min. Might be ok if id of ordered up a size or 2.",B0000ZE858
Great sports bra and their price is very competitive....,B0000ZE858
I have been wearing them for several years and they are a great fit and so very comfortable.,B0000ZE858
"Fits smaller than typical sizes, even with usinh size chart. Colors nice and didn't fade after first wash/dry cyvle.",B0000ZE858
Possibly the most supportive soft cup bra I've ever found. Wow!,B0000ZE858
The most comfortable underwire bra ... perfect fit...very good support....no bulges at the top or sides...nice smooth lines under sweaters..it is perfect for everyday wear. I am a 36C...,B0000ZE858
"I have ordered this same bra for years. The new edition hooks and eyes dig into my back, and it seems to be made of flimsy material so the band has overstretched and the wires are out of shape. Very disappointed.",B0000ZE858
Nothing to review. Did not buy this,B0000ZE858
"I have been purchasing and wearing these bras for a few years.  I am big breasted and active, so I needed a bra with a lot of support.  They are the best fitting and most comfortable I have found, while providing the required support.",B0000ZE858
The straps do not fall down. YES.  Nice material. Other reviews said cups ran large so I ordered a 46C instead of D. I am happy.,B0000ZE858
Not the best cup size fit and the bra was very uncomfortable. It hurt to wear it. I would not recommend this brand.,B0000ZE858
"It fits as expected, and is very flattering for a sports bra. However, I am still searching for a full support bra that is both flattering and made of a soft material that doesn't chafe. I have found a another brand in a comfortable material, but the cups offer no definition. Years ago you could buy a bra that was both comfortable and flattering. Where did those bras go?",B0000ZE858
Does the trick for large breasted female.,B0000ZE858
Have used this brand for years.  Occasionally have to sew a wire back in but they wear well!,B0000ZE858
https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000J6GE46/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0,B0000ZE858
This didn't  fit well at all. Stay away,B0000ZE858
"did not like this bra, is not very supportive and looks really bad on.",B0000ZE858
"This bra is true to size and feels very sturdy and supportive and is comfortable enough considering it's full coverage with underwires. The front of the bra comes up high and the top of the underwires in the cleavage don't come up alI the way, but they do come up high and they pull on the material a bit so it's not flat/smooth, which isn't a big deal as long as this area isn't stressed or tears. I use this as a sports bra, but the lift, separation, and natural shape of the cup make it all purpose as long as I don't wear a low cut shirt.",B0000ZE858
Great support wonderful value for money! Arrived on time. Delighted thanks!!,B0000ZE858
This bra is awesome.  It was sized as stated in the sizing chart.  My breasts fit fully into the cups no under arm spillage.  Held well when active.  So comfortable I actually wore it to work several times.,B0000ZE858
"Since when do Sport Bras come with a hook closure and underwires.  I want a REAL Sports Bra!! Description to search extremely misleading!
It will go in a drawer with REGULAR BRAS I HAVE AND CANNOT WEAR BECAUSE BRA STRAPS ACTUALLY CAUSE PAIN ON MY LEFT SHOULDER AFTER Rotator cuff surgery.",B0000ZE858
"I but this brand bra all the time, but this was the first time I actually bought this style of bra.  I will not buy them again, as they are sized way too big, plus they are not comfortable at all.",B0000ZE858
"Good bra for the price, but band size is small by comparison to other brands, so I added an extender. Cup size is a little large compared to other sports bras, so I ordered down this time. I'm willing to modify as needed when I find a bra with comfort potential and this bra does that for me.",B0000ZE858
"I have a large cup size but small chest measurement and find it very difficult to find a comfortable sports bra.  I have had at least 3 of these for several years and just bought another.  Don't be dismayed by the plus size description,  this bra comes in a large variety of sizes, down to a size 32 band.  The bra has smooth cups, is very long lasting and I wear it for running, cycling, yoga,  hiking etc.  The only problem I have had is that I had to resew one of the hooks in the back closure in one of my older bras.  This was after many years use however.  I wash this in the washing machine but in a small laundry bag.  I also dry this on a rack and not in the dryer.  This bra is so comfortable that I sometimes wear it for daily use.  If you do not have a large cup size, then you can probably avoid the underwire and buy some other bra.  But for those of you with large girls this bra is a lifesaver.",B0000ZE858
"the bra is good, but I did not feel comfortable with the wires, and I usually wear my regular bras with wires on it!",B0000ZE858
Second one I have purchased and it works great.  It lasts and is very comfortable for exercising.  Compared to the higher priced ones it is a deal.,B0000ZE858
This bra is ugly... but awesome. I hated sports bras that gave a uniboob look and lacked support for large breasts. This bra keeps the girls in place and defines 2 breasts... I was a 38 h... now I'm a 34 c after a year plus dedication to the gym. I've bought about 6 of these in all sizes. It reminds me of my grandma's swim suits without a shirt covering... gives the cone boobs look (can't tell with a shirt over it though),B0000ZE858
The underwire hits on ribs not where it is to hit not working for my runs,B0000ZE858
The cups on this bra where way too large!,B0000ZE858
"For some reason I neglected to realize this sports bra had under wires... It fits well, I just feel a tad strangled in my bra after giving up under wires for a year... I feel very 1950s",B0000ZE858
"This seems like a really good value for the money if you get can get the size right. It's less than half the price of a comparable Panache, Freya, or Wacoal sports bra.

The band seems pretty stretchy, I fastened it on the tightest hooks right out of the bag, so it would go back even if the cups fit. I'm usually a 34G/H in US sizing and 34F/FF/G in UK sized bras. I measured the cup depth as 12.3"" wire-to-wire and the height from the base of the underwire to the top seam is 8.5"". Bratabase.com says the Panache non-wired sports bra in 36FF has similar measurements! This bra has US sizing and is available in up to a G cup which I'm guessing will fit like a UK G or GG. The gore is a little wide for me at 1.5"" where the wires end. The gore is 4"" tall from the base of the underwires to their ends.

This bra seems pretty nicely made for the price. The cups are lined with a perforated CoolMax fabric that is supposed to wick away moisture. The seams are covered and the underwires are well padded. It feels very soft and comfortable to wear. I can't answer for motion control of course but the shaping looks pretty good even if it's a bit pointy. There is a seam along the tops f the cups and there is fabric above that covers the chest so you don't have to worry about falling out if you're doing an inverted pose.

I doubt I'll try a different size as I'm close-set at the top and the wide gore is a deal breaker for me. It could work well for you though if you have average width between your breasts and wear up to a G/GG UK size in a 32-48 band. Order the band size you wear in an everyday bra - this is one sports bra you don't need to size up.",B0000ZE858
"This bra is amazing. It is soft, supportive, made extremely well and comes in many sizes, even hard to find sizes. I will definitely order again.",B0000ZE858
great support comfortable under-wire and shoulder straps,B0000ZE858
I like it so much that I bought a strapless bra from Lunaire.,B0000ZE858
Good product.  I had to exchange to size down.,B0000ZE858
"It's a little tight in the band area, and I have it on the loosest hooks.  It also leaves marks on my skin when I take it off.  Other than that, it is comfortable to wear.",B0000ZE858
"the best bra for really large breasted women; bought three, one of each color, plan to use it as top half of swimsuit as well.  these were made ages ago of much more softer fabric, two ply with cotton. now that was a wonderful bra.  I don't know who makes these decisions for us to discontinue something so wonderful as that bra but it surely must have been a man.  (hope he meets him just rewards!), my vote will be thumbs down.) it's a little stiff for everyday wear but there is nothing out there for good support.  too bad.  recommended.",B0000ZE858
Holds everything in place... no spilling out and just the right amount of bounce control without squishing you to a flattening sweaty uniboob mess.,B0000ZE858
This is a great supportive bra especially for a larger busted woman. I fit snugly in a 34DDD and a little loose in a 36DD. (I always fit between band sizes.) Fits well and it is quite comfortable.,B0000ZE858
The underwire broke out after my wife had only worn it three times!,B0000ZE858
It fit very nicely. It wears comfortably,B0000ZE858
I have a hard time finding bras that fit me right and are comfortable.  I wear this as my every day bra and gives me the lift and support I want.,B0000ZE858
"Lunaire used to be great bras for the well endowed but this one is horrible. They have tried to save some money by cutting each underwire a 1/2 inch or so too short so instead of supporting you, it stabs you. I have worn it once and only made it a couple of hours. For the price I paid, I would expect far better. I wonder if this was a second-I didn't see it advertised as such but it certainly took the Lunaire brand out of my list of acceptable bras.",B0000ZE858
"Perfect lift and separate without feeling as though I'm being compressed like some sports bras
I can jog on treadmill without the bounce",B0000ZE858
Somewhat small and fabric is rough and scratchy.,B0000ZE858
"I expected it to be a little big because I really only need a b cup, not c.  it fits ok.  sometimes it moves around a little when I exercise.  may need a smaller chest size too.  the material is fantastic and wicks away sweat.",B0000ZE858
Very comfortable bra.  Fit was great.,B0000ZE858
Fits perfectly.  I will be ordering more.,B0000ZE858
I liked the item  as far as quality is concerned but it is too big on me and will have to return it for an exchange.,B0000ZE858
"The underwires extend way out on the sides so that my arms bump against them a bit.  I usually have the opposite problem.  The front center sticks out a little too, so it will look odd under clingy clothes.  However, I do like the fabric, so I'll wear it a few more times and see how it feels.",B0000ZE858
I loved this bra when i first received it. I purchased this bra to wear when jogging and walking for exercise. As soon as I put it on I was very impressed. The bra lifted and supported exactly where it was supposed to. I wore it maybe 10 times and then the worst thing ever happened. The center ribs started to bow outwards.it became so uncomfortable that I actually had to discreetly take it off while I was grocery shopping. I tried to wash it and figure out if there was a way to make it fit perfectly again. Nope ruined. $25 for a bra that I only got to wear 10 times.,B0000ZE858
"It is the best sports bra there is out there for women with larger breast.  It holds breast firmly so easy to run, etc..  I fully recommend it to everyone.",B0000ZE858
I am not happy with this product...at all... I wore it once.. and it was really uncomfortable... the wire stays..were poking me under the arm (pit)  not recommended ...,B0000ZE858
"Runs true to size my only complaint is there is no lining so it will show through if you're cold.  But does hold things in place, perfect for at home cardio.",B0000ZE858
"Great Bra!  Fits as I need it to fit, appears to be relatively close to ""true to size""; if anything just a tiny bit on the larger side - refreshing for a change.  The fabric is comfortable and it does what it is supposed to do.  This is the best bra I have found in YEARS! Especially considering the price point.
I will be ordering more of these - had ordered one to test it.  Want more sooner than later.",B0000ZE858
"don't like it much, it is pointy",B0000ZE858
Not very supportive. Not that comfortable. Just kinda blah.,B0000ZE858
Very supportive and comfortable,B0000ZE858
I typically wear a 34G US/34F UK.  I ordered this in a 34G and it seems to run large in the cups (some bagging at the top.)  The material is nice quality and the bra seems well made.  I would have liked a bit of padding as to avoid showing when it's cold.  Will likely order in a smaller cup size.,B0000ZE858
"It's a very sturdy bra, and comfortable, and fits a little larger than the usual size",B0000ZE858
This bra fits well and is versatile as it looks good under regular clothes as well as active gear.,B0000ZE858
"This is the first 'sports bra' I've owned. I LOVE IT. My size is a 42DDD and wasn't sure a sports bra would give the support I needed and still be comfortable. It is a great balance of comfort & support; so much so that I'm wearing it as an ""everyday"" bra today. And I actually bought a 2nd one today so I could have a different color. And the price was significantly cheaper than the plus size bras I have to buy from a well-known plus size retailer.
I bought it to wear under my swimsuit for water aerobics (because my swimsuit is getting loose & I am having a difficult time finding a replacement). While I'm water exercising, it's comfortable and secure - I just hope it can withstand the chlorinated water.",B0000ZE858
Wire. Wire is evil. And this wire sneaks up on you when you turn the wrong way and stabs you.,B0000ZE858
Good fit.  Very firm hold.  I don't bounce in 38DDD+.  I've worn this bra for years.  Just disappointed that they took rows of hooks from 4 to 3.  Reasonable price.,B0000ZE858
"Fits well and is pretty comfortable. However, if you don't want Blonde Ambition Tour Madonna boobs, do not purchase this sports bra.",B0000ZE858
"The cup size was a bit larger than I expected, but it's more likely that I should've ordered a 42C and not a 44C. It's pretty comfortable and a good price!",B0000ZE858
Exactly what I needed. Good fit and sturdy,B0000ZE858
Eh.  Will return....puckered in wierd places and didn't provide much support.  Good concept but poor execution.,B0000ZE858
Cup size was a little small but still like this bra. Great support,B0000ZE858
I do not like wires or stays.  Sending it back.,B0000ZE858
love this bra.... this is the second time I have purchased the bra.... and will probably again if it is still for sale.,B0000ZE858
I like the design but I bought this bra because of the reviews. I am sadly disappointed. The wires poke me under the armpit they are not seen into a thick pocket on the end,B0000ZE858
Best sports and regular bra EVER!,B0000ZE858
I already ordered another one. I usually double up on my sports bras before a workout because I love to run and don't get the support I need with just one bra. Not with this bra.  I wear a 34/36 DDD it's all the support I need.  It's changed my workouts forever. I love the support and coverage it gives.,B0000ZE858
"Cup fit was about average but the band was considerably smaller than expected. Should probably return it but I'll just save it. Quality seems okay, but I haven't washed it yet.",B0000ZE858
The quality of the fabric is rough to he skin. It's a good support however runs very small.,B0000ZE858
"I tried to like this bra. The underwire is too hard. After wearing the bra all day, (the underwire keep sticking me on the side) I ended up with a huge bruise where the underwire was rubbing uncomfortably all day. Had to toss the bra away. Will have to try another brand.",B0000ZE858
"This bra is incredibly comfortable. The band is slightly tighter than I am used to, but it's expected for a sports bra. The underwire is wonderful at removing that dreaded uni-boob, and there is very minimal bounce.",B0000ZE858
"I agree it is a well made, supportive bra. I love how the band is wide enough to pull it down and give support.  Just because it is a supportive bra for large breasted women, does not mean it shouldn't have enough padding or lining to give a smoother look.",B0000ZE858
I am so happy to have this bra!!  I wear a 32G/GG in most bras so it is so hard to find something that fits my body and is flattering. most bras leave my shoulders or upper back in pain.  Luckily these bras band size run small and the 34G is great. In the nude I start on the middle hook and the black I start on the last hook.  I have worn the 34DDD also. but with the G I get a little more support. since I don't start on the loosest hook I don't know how long I will be able to keep these tight.  I wear them to the gym as well as every day bra.  the seam is show thru the shirt but at the gym I don't care. and under thicker shirts it's ok. their comfortable and doesn't feel like armor. I have tried hundreds of bras (and will keep trying) but I have worn this one for a few years now. once again I've grown so I moved up to the G.  It seems like the older I get the bigger they get.  I would love to be a C cup like in college but I don't think I want to get a reduction.  I digress- you may think this bra seperates too much but at this point I'm just glad my shoulders and back don't hurt.,B0000ZE858
"Quality is good, but it was too small.",B0000ZE858
"Fits ok, bigger than I expected.  Under wires are not well protected and come up high so they dig into my armpits.  Not very thick material so need nipple pads if you wear tight shirts over it.",B0000ZE858
Good structure.  Will hold the girls during a workout.,B0000ZE858
Holds tight from the top. The 34 is snug. I always wear a 34 on the tightest hooks. This one I have to wear on the loosest. Still a 34 and the cup size is perfect DD. Actually love it. Only gonna hand wash to keep it strong.,B0000ZE858
"I bought one of these bras.  Because of the price, $20.40 I was leery about the fit but to my surprise, it is fabulous.  They are a wee bit pointy but with clothes on it isn't a big deal.  I like the bra so much I ordered two more.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Also, the first bra arrived quite fast so I'm sure the other two will as well.",B0000ZE858
"This is the best bra, ever! I could sell it---Seriously. Better support than most sports bras & better coverage + It minimizes for everyday bra wearing. Can't say enough positives about this bra! I wear it to the gym,  and everyday life. I won't wear anything else, and I'll cry if they ever stop selling this style!",B0000ZE858
"This bra does not have such great support, but for the price it is good.  I wear this with sweats when doing low impact.  It is very comfortable. Fits true to size so had to re order in my regular size",B0000ZE858
fit way too small... I didn't like the style neither..,B0000ZE858
Had to return because it was at least 2 sizes too small.,B0000ZE858
My son peed through this three times.,B0000ZE858
Fit was fantastic n as always received  on time a 5 star for sure...,B0000ZE858
"Underwire digs into the side of your breast something awful .While exercising it does not keep your breast intact. If your  doing and kind of cardio ,running or jumping your breast will move completely with the motion",B0000ZE858
"It's an alright bra. The cups are thin, so if you always have your headlights on high beam, this is not the sports bra for you. The wires have very little padding so they dig in pretty badly until you find that perfect placement. But other then those two things, this bra is pretty alright. I'm a triple D and when I jump my tits don't move an inch. The support is great too. Also, the asthetics are interesting. This bra makes your boobs into torpedos.",B0000ZE858
I like the fabric.  There is some issue of wire poking in arm pit.  I needs some additional padding at end of wire for me. Otherwise it is a ok as a bra can be......,B0000ZE858
"It is mid-November and this bra is beginning to break down.  I do wear my sports bras a lot because I do 2-a-days plus I am starijg my running journey, so this could just be an anomaly, but the wires are beginning to come through the fabric plus the material is stretching thin.",B0000ZE858
"finally a great, supported fitness bra!",B0000ZE858
wonderful sports bra and is surprisingly comfortable and (for a sports bra) fairly flattering.  Recommended.,B0000ZE858
Very pleased with the fit and feel. I needed it since joining the gym and I'm happy I purchased it.,B0000ZE858
"Good fit, comfortable material. Only problem I have is the underwire isn't padded very well, and the upper seam under the arm folds away, exposing the point of the underwire, so I'm getting rubbed or poked every time I move.",B0000ZE858
Not as supportive as it says. Gives pointy boobs.,B0000ZE858
"36DDD. There's not enough cup support to be a sports bra; too much jiggle. Also, the straps in front were so wide set that I would have chafed with physical activity. Would be a great everyday bra, except I'm petite (5'0'') and the straps were so long that I couldn't shorten them enough. The bra cups' underwire padding was heavenly and I hesitated to send it back.",B0000ZE858
"I have always struggled to find comfortable bras in my size, 42D. I was in desperate need of a new sports bra and did a lot of searching online before settling on this one. I bought this bra two weeks ago and have used it regularly.

Positives: The ""girls"" are held tightly and securely. When I run, my breasts don't bounce too much. The cup and waist sizes were accurate.

Negatives: The under-wire has a tendency to move, especially during seated exercises or upside-down activities (ie. yoga). This can be painful and distracting.",B0000ZE858
"Unfortunately, I had to return this bra as the cups were a bit large. The band size fit well. Also, I found that eventually the breasts would be pushed together creating a uniboob. Not a desired effect. Additionally, I found the cups to be too see through leading to visible nipple impression on T shirts and white tops.
The bra needs some structural redesign to live up to its full potential.",B0000ZE858
"Had one from years ago, but needed a second one.  The BEST sports bra I have ever tried!",B0000ZE858
"Not consistent sizing - one black, one white - shrunk black one to fit better. Nice though.",B0000ZE858
Holy underwire! There's one big underwire across the front of the bra. I returned it.,B0000ZE858
I've tried this brand's products before and really liked them and decided to get one of their sports bras when I needed one.  (I hadn't owned one in years and got tired of abusing my other bras)  It does a great job without feeling too restraining and tight.  I've used it a good bit now and have yet to see it show much wear or hold odor.  It's a great choice if you're a bit more busty and still like to be active.,B0000ZE858
"It is a comfortable bra, but not a sports bra. I horseback ride and it didn't do nothing. Just like wearing a regular bra!:(",B0000ZE858
I love this bra for working outside.  It does a good job of wicking away sweat and keeping me drier.,B0000ZE858
Comfortable exercise bra with support.,B0000ZE858
"I am returning this item. Since this is marketed as a plus-size item for large breasted women, it cannot be considered a high-impact sports bra. The band is made of a material that is way to supple and the straps attach to the back with a VERY thin hoop. The strap adjustments are poorly made and the cup shape is odd. I actually couldn't find anything positive to report...",B0000ZE858
"The band is tight, as one expects from a sports bra, but the cups don't provide any support whatsoever.",B0000ZE858
This is a great bra for full figured women who run.  I've bought this same bra for several years!,B0000ZE858
"Sadly, for the first time ever in a 32DD, I found a bra where the cups are too big.  I had to send it back.  I wish it had fit, it looked like it would have been a great sports bra.",B0000ZE858
Item was returned. The fit was not flattering.,B0000ZE858
I originally purchased this bra to use for running and after trying it on I decided I wouldn't like running in it. I went through several thoughts at first. I have to say I had a moment where I felt like Madonna when she wore her cones. After trying it on with a tee shirt I found that I love this bra. Of course you can't wear anything too low cut with this bra. I am a 32DD and I love how this bra lifts and gives a youthful look instead of the usual big round blobs most bras gives us ladies that have big busts. This bra is fairly comfortable to be worn all day and provides great support.,B0000ZE858
"This sports bra is NOT attractive but it is the best bra I've ever worn to work out in. I would highly recommend it based on functionality. I ordered a 36G which is my regular size, and it fits really well.",B0000ZE858
"This is my new favorite horseback riding bra. I ride dressage, which involves a lot of sitting trot work. A flimsy bra will NOT do. This bra does the job.",B0000ZE858
Love this product and get major complements.,B0000ZE858
"It's a great sports bra. Keeps the ladies separated, and supported, even while running. I run half marathons and this bra does all that I need a sports bra to do. I wear a 36 DDD, and ordered a 38DD and the band is about perfect (maybe a little tight) but the cups are too big! Definitely order up in band size and down/same cup size.",B0000ZE858
Waste size was fine but the cups were way over sized. Nice quality but had to send back because of fit.,B0000ZE858
Excellent construction and pretty comfortable.  Just a little tight on me.,B0000ZE858
"Quite the lift with the underwire, makes the chest perky, but doesn't offer as much support as specified. Wanted this bra for high impact aerobics, but will only be able to wear it for light - moderate exercise. I am a 38DD, and the bra fit very nicely and is comfortable.",B0000ZE858
Used to wear this bra in a smaller size.  Bought it again.  Not happy anymore.  The straps dig into my shoulders.  Wouldn't recommend it.,B0000ZE858
larger than any of my 36C bras. Feels more like a 38D,B0000ZE858
Under wire was uncomfortable for me. But most under wires are uncomfortable to me.,B0000ZE858
If it would have fit i would have loved it but i got something on it and i doubt they would let me return it then,B0000ZE858
"3 Stars for the full coverage it provides! 1 star for the straps have an overlap of fabric under the part that touches your shoulder, which digs in and hurts, not to mention leaves a mark by the end of the day. When I work out, the girls still jump around as well. It feels like I should have gone a cup size smaller. I don't have the pointiness that others have described. If you can find a way to cushion the strap, and get the right cup size, it's  an ok bra I guess, but I will not buy again, I will try another brand.",B0000ZE858
I hope the wires do not come out under the cups like my last ones.,B0000ZE858
"Fit well and for me true to size, I like the back support and feeling like I'm in a 'cage'.  by the end of the day I'm eager to get into my pajamas, but maybe if I would stand straighter it wouldn't pinch.",B0000ZE858
"Love it,  I really want to get a couple more,",B0000ZE858
"Very large in the cups and wires do not fit right, totally uncomfortable",B0000ZE858
It's ok but not as much support as I expected.,B0000ZE858
"Great bra. Very supportive for large busts in high impact wear. Underwire is comfy and lays just fine. Cups run larger than expected, waistband is a bit snugger than expected but perfect after just one use. Will probably buy a smaller cupsize shortly.",B0000ZE858
"Omgs. I am so happppppppy. :)
Perfect. All of my breast fit into the cup. I just got them and I'm wearing g them right now. Perfect fit.",B0000ZE858
"Good support, not sure why this is called Plus size as I wear a size 6???",B0000ZE858
"I am not a very big woman but I do have a large chest area, and I love running. This bra holds everything in place when I'm out for a run. Very pleased, this was my second one. Great bra, would recommend.",B0000ZE858
Weird cone shaped boobs is not the look I was going for...... bad seam placement as well.  Awful.,B0000ZE858
I found this bra to uncomfortable. The wires are very uncomfortable.,B0000ZE858
"I have worn this bra maybe 5 or 6 times and the underwire is already popping through the fabric.  Very poorly made, but I am outside the return window so no returns....",B0000ZE858
"Godd quality construction, though runs about an inch small.",B0000ZE858
"It's a bit big for me ... I'm going to try the ""unthinkable"" and put it in the dryer to see if that will shrink the cups a bit.  I don't want to give the bra a poor rating because I may have ordered a size larger than actually needed.  I had made the assumption that given this is a high impact bra that it might run small.  Overall the quality is nice and it looks like it would offer sufficient support if I had purchased the proper size.",B0000ZE858
This is a very comfortable fitting bra. It came in record time.,B0000ZE858
"Like others have mentioned, adjust your size when ordering. I am a 44 ddd and ordered a 46dd. The fit is perfect and there is minimal bounce. I am going to order a second one!",B0000ZE858
This bra is wonderful it fits so well shapes my breast just the way I like it. My breast has room to breathe and the underwire isn't a bother it doesnt cut into my skin like other underwires bras have done in the past. I am comfortable wearing it all day long and its a perfect fit and I can bend over and nothing falls out happy happy. This bra is great for any plus woman  who has a lot to manage with a small frame or large frame body. I would recommend this bra to all the women. Lunaire u have done it again I can always depend on your product no matter what number one best choice of bras!!!,B0000ZE858
Love my new sports bra. Holds the girls in place and it's very comfortable. Highly recommended.,B0000ZE858
Pretty happy. I believe the cups are too small they hurt my boobs after awhile.,B0000ZE858
So I wear a 32DDD so it's very hard to find any bra let alone a sports bra so I had ordered this one based on reviews. Omg when it arrived I tried it on and instead of feeling comfortable I felt like Madonna with her pointy cone bra! Needles to say I'll be returning this one looking for a much better fitting and comfortable bra,B0000ZE858
Awesome bra except the sizing is way off.,B0000ZE858
"Been wearing this bra style for years, just adjusting sizing as needed.  Comfortable with good support",B0000ZE858
"Badly made, hooks are almost unusable.",B0000ZE858
The bra was wonderful but didn't last long,B0000ZE858
"Great fit, very comfortable and supports while running just as hoped.",B0000ZE858
"had to use a bra band extender due to the super snug fit, but it does the job holding everything where it should be during intense workouts and feels great on",B0000ZE858
"Wasn't as high impact as I wanted it to be, but as far as having larger breasts it did a great job holding everything in place during a high intensity work out on the elliptical. Still for a long lasting, over a year and high quality bra I would say spend the $50-$60 and just go with Victoria's Secret, since those are definitely quality tested and worth it.",B0000ZE858
This bra has a great supportive structure but the fabric that the cups are made of seem to be of a cotton non stretch content . The band and shoulder straps supportive but the cups just let ones breasts move and sway with activity.,B0000ZE858
This has good support and is surprisingly comfortable.,B0000ZE858
Have purchase lots of these.  Love them.,B0000ZE858
"This was by far the largest ""G"" cup I've ever tried on. I tried a smaller size and still found that these bras are not ""High Impact"" as advertised. They're cheap for a reason. Spend a few more bucks on a good sports bra. Your ladies will appreciate the support.",B0000ZE858
I love this bra!  It absorbs sweat!  It's comfortable to wear while working out.  It holds all the right bits and pieces in place while working out.  I've ordered this bra several times and it's the same awesome bra without fail!,B0000ZE858
"Need better support. I had to sew up the straps to make them much shorter to get that ""lift"" in the cups.",B0000ZE858
"This sports bra is awesome!!!! I searched high and low for the perfect bra, and this is it. The size is right on, perfectly snug fit, and comfortable. Would definitely recommend.",B0000ZE858
Clothes and shoes by different manufacturers will size differently. I was unsure what size to get for optimal sports performance. Overall this is a well made garment and I would buy again with proper sizing. Very comfortable. I can even sleep in it.,B0000ZE858
I Thought it was a sports bra. But it's okay. I did not know it underwire. but i will pay for it. thanks.,B0000ZE858
"I wear a 32F in all bras, but this bra in a 34dd and it is perfect. It wears well and is very comfortable. I wear it for running, but do wear a second compression bra over it. When just working out (stairmaster, weights etc) I wear it alone and it offers exceptional support.",B0000ZE858
"Creates rather pointy breasts AND it does not lay flat on your chest between the breasts which creates a lump in your shirt.  If you can live with that, it does the job.",B0000ZE858
"Not what I thought I had ordered. #1 too small, # 2 I NEVER wear underwire bras, why would I have ordered an underwire ""SOFT FIT COMFORT"" bra ? The two terms don't EVEN belong together in the  same bra! Underwire  & comfort ? NO WAY! They will be returned",B0000ZE858
band doesnt have a lot of stretch.  I think it will hold up better as a result though,B0000ZE858
I have worn these for years but it seems the quality has deteriorated. Just didn't give me the lift I want. Felt saggy the first day even with strap and hook adjustments,B0000ZE858
Did not like this bra at all the cup size was way way to big.  If you want a sports bra this is not the one for you I returned it,B0000ZE858
I'm normally a 34G but since I'm pregnant i decided to order a 36DDD. The band is a little tight. Probable just buy an extender for it. Haven't tried it out yet so idk how supportive it is.,B0000ZE858
I could have gotten away with 42DD instead of DDD...had to return because the wires would stick out between Brest,B0000ZE858
"the fit is very very snug, but it keeps me cool in hot humid weather.",B0000ZE858
I am always looking for the perfect bra and I finally found it.  The Coolmax does make a big difference in the summer.  The bra is true to size and has good lift too without adding bulk. This is the only bra I will ever buy again.,B0000ZE858
"After reading a slew of independent reviews and considering what I wanted and needed in a sports bra, I figured that I may as well give this bra a try.  It arrived promptly and was extremely comfortable from the beginning.  I don't think that I expected to be so pleased with how well it minimized bounce and chafing,  and I know I didn't expect it to be so flattering that I would wear it outside of my runs, but I was pleasantly surprised on both counts.  I  never spend any more on a bra than absolutely necessary, but I am looking forward purchasing it in the remaining colors in which it is available.  Seriously,  the bra is just that good.",B0000ZE858
"Not at all what I am used to in a ""sports bra""; I will be returning it",B0000ZE858
Just not right for me.  I do not like my breasts to touch.,B0000ZE858
"Fit is fine and the bra is comfortable while working out. I will say that I agree with all other reviewers in saying that the bra gives you that ""pointy"" look. Ok for me since I workout at home!",B0000ZE858
"In my experience, it is rare to find a sports bra that doesn't create a breast shelf on larger cup-size women. This bra actually creates separation while providing appropriate lift (doesn't create cone breasts for me). It's very comfortable as well. As for support, I'd rate it as an 8 on a 10-point scale which is fine because, for me,  a bra that rates a 10 out of 10 for larger busted women has to be so tight and constrictive that it just isn't comfortable. One reason that this bra does provide very good support is that it is high cut enough to keep the breasts in place while moving around. Regarding fit, I initially ordered one cup size larger than my usual size since my past experience with sports bras was that they ran a bit small. I found this not true for this style bra, so I returned it and ordered my usual size which is just right.",B0000ZE858
"If been wearing these bras for years. They provide the best support for larger sized women. The straps are not elastic and this increases support. They are also full coverage on top so it keeps your girls in. But it is still comfortable enough to wear all day.
The fit is also true to size.",B0000ZE858
"As suggested by other people, this bra DOES run small in the number and a bit more spacious in the cup size than the average bra. If you like your bras on one of the inner hooks, measure your ribs where your bra sits and add 4 to the number - if you only add 2 you will be wearing it on the outermost set of hooks.
I'm a 40H - I ordered a 42G and it fits very well - though I prefer to have at least 1 extra set of hooks that are looser than what I use just in case.

Would I order it again? Yes.
Would I probably pick a 44G instead of a 42G having tried this bra? Unless I lose some weight in the near future, yes.",B0000ZE858
"Soft yet very supportive, straps that are wide and therefore don't cut into the shoulders, underwire that is so comfortable you don't realize it's even there. This bra is awesome! I ordered one to start just to see how I liked it. Yesterday I ordered more. The 38D is an absolutely perfect fit for me.",B0000ZE858
This bra is full coverage and good support with great lift. I will buy this item again and recommend to others.,B0000ZE858
"I like that this bra fits well with underwire supports that are comfortable.  However, I wish the straps had a bit of padding on the shoulders and that the straps were a little wider.",B0000ZE858
Tootsie's boobies are cool so she doesn't get crankie on hot days. She is a happy camper when she goes camping.,B0000ZE858
"I lucked out and got two of these bras on clearance for $8 each at a chi-chi specialty bra shop. Best $16 I've spent in a long time, but I would pay full price for them now that I know how great they are!

I bought them in a 40DD, and they are definitely snug, but not uncomfortably so. Plus I would expect them to be a little tight since they need to be supportive. With normal sports bras, I'm always conscious of my boobs bouncing up and down when I'm on the elliptical or working out with my trainer. This bra holds them in place and I don't even give them a second thought. I wish it wasn't so ugly, as I can't wear any workout tanks or V-neck T's with it, but I don't go to the gym to try and look cute anyway so it's not a huge deal.

The only downside I've noticed is that the clasp in the back can be hard to undo. I actually had to tear out one of the eyelets just last week because I couldn't get the darn thing unhooked. I think I warped them by accidentally washing it without a lingerie bag, so this may just be a fluke.

I will definitely be buying more of these once the two I've got are worn out, or (hopefully) I've lost the weight and need a smaller size!!",B0000ZE858
"My wife ordered a 36 GG, which is her typical size.
Ended up returning for 2 reasons:
1. cups were too big (this is always a crap shoot, so not many marks off here).
2. the fabric above the cups covered her entire cleavage, making many of her tops unwearable.
Being a well-endowed woman, she likes the extra support of a sports bra, but the extra fabric seems unnecessary.",B0000ZE858
"I needed a workout bra, my girls were so smashed they hurt, it is really hard to find a workout bra that doesn't smush large breasts.  This is unfortunately one of those, it didn't come down long enough either so I had to wear this and a regular bra over it which sort of defeats the purpose of having a workout bra- my search continues......",B0000ZE858
Doesnt fit like I was expecting it to. Order at lease one smaller size down than you normally wear abd you'll probably be golden. Didnt like the seam placement so much either,B0000ZE858
"I just had a fitting and was told to go to a G cup.  So I did.  It is a bit big.  Comfortable band with and straps. Since the cups are big, I don't believe the support is all there.  Also, the top of the bra is very high.  I can not wear it with my V-neck work out T-shirts.  Only crew neck.
Price was great.  Cheaper than buying from Dillards.",B0000ZE858
Wasn't sure about ordering a bra on line but it worked out just fine.  Price was so much better than in stores esp for my size.,B0000ZE858
"Comes up very high on me in tha armpit area. Gives moderate support, lots of separation and a fairly pointy siluette.",B0000ZE858
I love the fit and style of this sport bra.it is the best sport bra I have ever brought. I have all colors available.,B0000ZE858
It is my first sports bra and it fits well  and  is very comfortable and supportive.  I will probably buy another one.,B0000ZE858
The first one I had of this bra was great so I ordered a second. This one had a problem with how the back was stitched leading to a really nasty rough spot that created a raw sore on my back.,B0000ZE858
"I am well endowed, 42 DDD and have the HARDEST time finding bras that work. Sports bras are a nightmare all on their own. This bra does a great job at keeping me supported and lifts them up where they should be. It's nice and cool. I worked out at maximum heart rate for an hour and didn't have a nasty sweaty bra at the end. It was nice and dry. It's comfortable enough to wear as a regular bra, and supportive enough as a sports bra.

I usually don't pay a lot for bras (maybe that was part of the problem), but this bra was worth every cent. I felt very comfortable and confident wearing it.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the straps were a little scratchy on my shoulders. Not enough to cause a rash or anything, just a little uncomfortable at first. But the benefits FAR outweigh that, and I can deal with a little scratchiness for such great support. It's not a pretty bra, but it's very functional.",B0000ZE858
I have always been looking for a sport bra that has a good support and its not uncomfortable to wear.. Found it!!!,B0000ZE858
"I love this bra.  It is extremely comfortable and very reasonably priced.  I am glad I can still find it here.  Dillard's stopped carrying it and I think that was big mistake.  It can't be beat for fit, comfort and price.",B0000ZE858
"Ordered for its Coolmax and fit features, it seemed to expand some after laundering so perhaps ordering a size smaller might have  been better. Also there was not a lot of strap adjustment but with these summer temps still a good item.",B0000ZE858
"This bra is EXACTLY what I have been searching for. It's wicking properties are great. No more uncomfortable wetness against my chest. I love the support it gives. I started out with two and got four more. It has made this hot, sweaty summer much more bearable for me. I even sleep in this bra. Recommended.",B0000ZE858
"This bra is not a good sports bra.  It does not hold me firm; it works better as a regular bra, but it is comfortable.",B0000ZE858
"I have been wearing these sports bras for years and I love them, except for their one big flaw. The underwire quickly (sometimes after a couple of wearings, sometimes after a month or so) works its way out from under its plastic cap, and then pokes through the fabric and into the wearer's breast (big OW!).  Alternately, if it comes uncapped on its inside-end, you can suddenly find it sticking out the neckline of a scoop-necked shirt (been there-- middle of the workday), but you're less-likely to be stabbed with it in this scenario.

Other than that, the fit is good, the support is great and I like the appearance of them.  I have successfully repaired a couple, cutting open the wire's channel, gluing the cap back on, and stitching them back up (yes, that's how much I like them), but that doesn't always work.

If Lunaire can fix this one defect, it might become the perfect larger-size sports bra.

Update 2014--I bought another one and wore it for months, and the wire did not come out of either end and stab me!  Eventually the underwire fractured (also uncomfortable, but par for the course with an well-worn underwire bra).  I don't know if it was luck, or if they improved the design, but I just bought another one and we shall see.",B0000ZE858
"I love this bra.  I have it in both black and white. I wear the 36G and I use the black for outdoorsy stuff like backpacking and canoe tripping and I wear the white for medium to low intensity workouts like strength training and zumba.  I've tried jogging in it (like across the backyard) and it doesn't support me as well as my Enell which I use for running and soccer.  My only complaint is that the underwire started poking me in the side on the 4th day of my 7 day canoe trip this summer.  I think it stretches a little with continuous wearing and swimming in it. This didn't happen when I wore it for a few days straight backpacking.  I don't sleep in it, but I will probably take a 2nd bra to rotate daily on my next canoe trip.  The best thing though is that even though I wore it for a few days straight (which could be kinda gross), it didn't smell and it seemed as good as new after I washed it at home.",B0000ZE858
"This is more like a bra than a sports bra, but it'll do for low impact exercising.  It gives you a nice shape.",B0000ZE858
"I am large - 36DD.  This bra is very comfortable and definitely holds one up and the sides in.  The only problem with the bra is that it is high up in front - so if you plan to wear a low fronted top, this is not the bra for you.  All other regular type tops look great with this bra.",B0000ZE858
LOVE this bra! Its my absolute favorite sports bra. I never have any bounce even when doing the hardest workouts. Will buy again and again!,B0000ZE858
"This bra is comfortable, and supports me appropriately. I bought it based on the previous reviews of other women with larger breast. Great value also.",B0000ZE858
"The main reason that I bought this bra was for it's CoolMax fabric... it really wicks away the moisture.  However, please be aware that the bottom band is not made of coolmax... and that's one area that does collect some moisture!  I like the support that it offers - enough to keep me from bouncing uncomfortable, but not enough to make me feel imprisoned.  Some reviewers complained about the pointed cups.... that isn't a problem with me as I'm from the generation that bought bras to ""LIFT & SEPARATE"" :-)

I also really like the adjustable straps, as I'm extra tall, and most sports bras have too short of straps for me.  If the bra survives several washings, I plan on buying more of these nice bras.",B0000ZE858
ordered a 34DD like i usually wear and it was too tight. replaced it with a 36DD and the cups were too big. returned it for credit.,B0000ZE858
"Best sport bra I had for my size, fantastic if you are a bustier woman.",B0000ZE858
"I have this bra in nude...LOVE it!!  Comfy, cool, etc., etc.  I ordered it in black for a special weekend occasion...when I went to wear it, the sizing was at least 3 inches off & I had no choice but to wear an extender...it worked, but not well.  The following day (Sunday), I sent an email explaining the situation to HerRoom...3 days later I finally get a response saying that I wore the bra, so I'm stuck with it & sometimes bras just come in different sizes.  Really?!!?  We're talking 3 INCHES (at least!!)!!  This isn't the first time I've gotten a raw deal with this company (prior I bought undies...took them out of bag to find a hole & never wore them...they wouldn't accept them back, since they were out of the bag!?).  So again, I love the bra, but would NEVER buy from HerRoom again.",B0000ZE858
"This sports bra is good for moderate exercise or activity but I don't think it would offer enough support for some very active sports.  I am glad I have a gaited horse and not a rough riding one!  That said, it is a good value, well made and very comfortable.",B0000ZE858
I bought this bra a second time for my daughter and about to order more.  This bra really holds her in place especially during bouncing exercises and running.  I wholeheartedly recommend this bra.,B0000ZE858
"This bra is really great. I feel comfy and confident when I'm at the gym. It's very true to size and wicks away the sweat like no other! If you're tired of the saggy uni-boob formed by those other sports bras, order this one!",B0000ZE858
"I'm 44DD so I wear bras all the time.  This one is effective,  in that it lifts, and it gives good posture because if you slouch the wires stick out in the front - very unattractive,  so I find myself sitting straight.  It's comfortable but seriously not sexy, and comes up very high. It wears comfortably under my gym gear and I bought it for a gym bra but it's not very versatile,  as it shows under most of my other tops (and they're not particularly low cut)

Edited to add,  it wasn't flexible enough to be comfortable in exercise class and I've just thrown it out.  Didn't work at all for me.",B0000ZE858
"I am not a fan of underwires, so I was impressed by others' reviews of this bra, and decided to try it.  I have worn it running once, but found it doesn't cinch enough to reduce upper-chest bounce.  The underwire is also digging just a little on the outsides.  I am an odd size, though, and am still hoping it will be comfortable after I make some alterations.",B0000ZE858
This Sports Bra was exactly what I needed for our Fitness Center and it does well in all the activities I participate in.  Thanks.,B0000ZE858
Well made but he size is a but small around the rib cage.,B0000ZE858
Since I find it hard to find a sports bra that  is comfortable...and this one fit perfectly!,B0000ZE858
"I do not like this bra at all. Its very tight in the band, but the cups are loose. The cups are also set very far apart (more so than my natural breasts) which is weird. And lastly, they make me look like Madonna in that Poo type bra. I will not wear this and will likely return.",B0000ZE858
"I bought this bra in a 34 band size and it is DEFINITELY not a 34. I followed the size chart just to be sure, but when it arrived I tried it on and it was wayyyy too small. I measured it out of curiosity and it is actually a 32. So buy one band size up ladies. As far as I could tell, the cups were fine in terms of size.",B0000ZE858
Comfortable and separates (no uniboob :) Supportive for high impact workouts (rebounding) and gives nice silhouette under clothes. My favorite sports bra. Size: 32 DDD,B0000ZE858
Returned. Terrible fit. Made my shape look ridiculous and triangular. Cannot recommend.,B0000ZE858
Good fit and good quality. The reason for the four stars is it is somewhat uncomfortable to wear for long periods. It also has a material panel on the front that comes up very high on the chest. It shows underneath your shirt like you're wearing an undershirt or camy.,B0000ZE858
Love Lunaire in general.  Was happy to find this jogging bra which really holds me up.  Only flaw is WHY NO PADDED STRAPS?!?!  Big oversight but have hopes that theyll get this message.,B0000ZE858
"Really liked the fit of this. Hard to find one for a woman my size that is somewhat comfortable and also lifts well. However, it's been only about 9 months since using, and in that time I've ALWAYS washed in a mesh intimates bag and hang dried just for the sake of having it last longer. Not sure if it was just a coincidence, but the first time I didn't wash it this way, (misplaced the bag) the wire on one side popped out.......so I highly recommend handwashing or always using an intimates bag to machine wash. Wish I could find something that fits as well that isn't so fragile.",B0000ZE858
it's ok. not too comfortable . The stripes don't adjust. But its' cotton.,B0000ZEB9G
"I was disappointed with this product.  Previously, the straps were adjustable and the the fabric was a silky microfibre.  It also didn't meet expectations in terms of size.  To summarize,  the Elita Les Essentiels Spaghetti Strap Crossover does not offer an adjustable strap, fits small and has more of a brushed cotton feel.  I love Elita, but this was definitely not up to their original standard, nor what I anticipated.",B0000ZEB9G
This bralette is very cute....I wear a 34 DD....the 34 part is fine but if you have ANYTHING over a small C this WONT work for you.,B0000ZEB9G
"I am so tired of uncomfortable under wire and sport bras that are too tight to breathe.  I wanted a little simple white bra with spaghetti straps to go under this little white cami top I have.  This one looked good so I ordered it and it fits great, looks perfect under the little top and is comfortable.  I plan to buy more in other colors.  There are some other good looking ones out there on amazon I may try, but since this one's so good already, I'll probably just stick with it since it works!  Hope this review was helpful to somebody.  :)",B0000ZEB9G
"love the crossover type bra but I am a C cup and this bra is exactly what I would like, if I were an A or small B cup size.",B0000ZEB9G
Very nice bra.  I only wish it came in Silk Magic and also in nude color.  It doesn't.  I've ordered 3 more.,B0000ZEB9G
"I had this bra in black for the past several years, and although it wasn't very supportive, it was good for when i needed something spaghetti strap.  I recently ordered the same size in white and the fit is completely different, in a chest crushing way.  Very disappointing as I washed it and packed it and wasn't able to use it on my vacation as I had planned.  My advice is to order at least a size up from what you regularly wear unless you are an A cup at maximum.",B0000ZEB9G
"I was excited to receive this bra, but really disappointed when I got it. I knew as soon as I opened the bag that the material was poor quality. First of all, there is no stretch to the cotton and supposed lycra material. I am always a 34 C and my boobs didn't even fit into the cup and the waistband was uncomfortable and hardly stretched. Oh and on top of everything there is absolutely NO ELASTIC in the straps and they ARENT convertible. As soon as I put this bra on the strap broke. The strap that didn't break dug into my shoulder instantly. Definitely poor quality and I want my money back!",B0000ZEB9G
horrid fit & is not waist high at all!,B0000ZET52
"I am 5'2"" and about 130 pounds. I got a large because I have a *large bottom* and I don't like when thongs are tight (as I don't think anyone does).
They fit me as I thought they would, not snug but not too loose. I am satisfied with the fit.",B0000ZET52
I ordered three of these things for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves them. Two months ago she switched from wearing thongs to wearing boy cut panties because she said they were more comfortable. In reading the reviews on these things there were quite a few reviews that stated the fit and feel and comfort of these things were great. So I ordered them for her and she looked absolutely sexy back wearing thongs again!,B0000ZET52
Its very hard to find high waisted thongs that fit well.  I wear a large; ordered a large and the size was perfect.  Very well made too.,B0000ZET52
"With low rise (or butt crack of dawn) jeans so popular, this type of thong has almost gone the way of the dinosaur. They are very hard to find.  So, I was extremely pleased to see them here on Amazon.  I prefer the higher waist style, they just fit more comfortably up over the hip, and lay smoothly.  They don't roll down as I've had some thongs do.

My philosophy has always been:  If da undies ain't comfy, inta da garbage they go!!  I hate to admit how many new thongs I've thrown out over the years because they were uncomfortable. When I found a thong brand that worked well for me, I stuck with it.  Little by little over the years, my options kept dwindling until I found the Elita brand.

I love this brand.  It's the best I've come across and I will definately be purchasing more, just on the off chance they ever discontinue them.  I'll be the little old lady hoarder with the stockpile of them, but at least I'll be comfy during my golden years!  :)

"Hard to find a thong that is high waisted but not too high.  Very comfortable, some hold and good stretch.  Nice fabric.",B0000ZET52
A bit pricey for a cotton thong,B0000ZET52
These are awful.  Washed them & ended up throwing them in the trash because they are uncomfortable.,B0000ZET52
"Comfortable, silky, durable and easy care fabric.",B0000ZET52
traditional thong panty - not low rise - exactly what I wanted,B0000ZET52
"These are amazing! I love them so much, especially since they're hard to find now because low rise jeans are more common. More companies should continue to make these because I can say they've got my customer satisfaction! ",B0000ZET52
"hard to find high rise front thongs, these will work",B0000ZET52
Does not reach the waist line.  Wish it was a bit hire and more stretchable.,B0000ZET52
"This is a great stocking.  The top stays up and doesn't roll or bind.  Very nice length.  As we all know, one size does not fit all.  These are ordered in  sizes and are true to that size.  Very impressed with the product.  Need to find more colors!!!",B0000ZFMZS
"Cool shirt I bought for my bf! Fit as expected, little to no shrinkage when washed in cold H2O and dried on low. What he wanted his shirt to say - that's all I can tell you. Decent price and quality silkscreen/ print !",B000100IB0
Great shirt my boyfriend loves it,B000100IB0
Originally bought as a joke because of a 'near accident' but it always seems to get a laugh.  Just a fun shirt to wear for a day on a ride.,B000100IB0

My brother-in-law has always wanted one of these shirts. So I got on line and found this one. Inexpensive, was great for the laugh and fun it has given him. Quality for the price! :)",B000100IB0
It fits but the printing is on the front of the shirt not the back. How can people read while I'm on my bike if it's on the front. Doesn't make any sense.,B000100IB0
I get a lot of funny comments when I wear this shirt. The only negative comment was from a woman that told me she didn't think calling her a bitch was funny. I told her I never invited her to ride on the back of my motorcycle so I am not calling her anything.  LOL,B000100IB0
The material is very nice and comfortable. They shrink just a bit not bad in the dryer. This was a great gift for my huband and his buddy for the bike rides!! Very good product!!!!! Love the price!!!! Im very satisfied  ;),B000100IB0
My husband has wanted one of these forever.  He was sooooo excited when he opened it .,B000100IB0
Great socks for a great price.  We will use them for every sport!,B00012U2PU
The socks are great but they are much too big for my wee-baller (he is only 4!!) but I just roll them over so they make for a double sock on his lower leg it's working but it would be great if they came in a smaller size...,B00012U2M8
These socks appear to be really comfortable (my son wore them). They are of high quality -- they feel like real thin dress socks. We were very pleased with product.,B00012U2NC
I love these. They fit so well. Just perfect. I would recommend these to everyone. I never thought I'd wear thongs but I love them because there is no visible panty line. I don't like seeing that on anyone. Ugh!  Especially me. Not to worry with these. And they are comfortable too.,B000144RHC
"Let me make one thing clear at the outset: I. HATED. ALL. THONG. PANTIES.  With a passion.  Over the years, I experimented with all kinds of thong underwear, attempting to find one that didn't make me feel like I was walking around all day with a constant ""wedgie.""  I tried every type of thong in existence, from classic cut, to Brazilian, tanga, and G-string; in every type of fabric, e.g., cotton, tactel, satin, mesh, lace, and polyamide.  To no avail.

Enter Hanky Panky.  At first, I balked at paying $20 for a single panty, especially since I wouldn't be able to return it if it didn't fit or was uncomfortable.  But after striking out with some cheaper brands, and some not-so-cheap brands (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Gossamer-Women-s-Mesh-Hip-G-Thong-Panty/dp/B002AQSNX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Gossamer Women's Mesh Hip G Thong Panty</a>), I caved and purchased a couple pairs of these Hanky Panky thong panties in black, Plus-Size.  (I had to purchase them from a 3rd-party seller because Amazon doesn't offer the plus-sized Hanky Panky, which fits sizes 14-24).

These panties turned out to be the best $40 I ever spent!  For about an hour after I first put them on, I was on ""high alert,"" looking out for that familiar ""wedgie"" feeling to kick in, but it never did.  I ended up wearing these panties for the entire day (which included quite a bit of walking), and they were still as comfortable at 9 p.m. as they'd been at 9 a.m.  At heart, I'm still a bikini-hipster type of woman, but these Hanky Panky panties have come very close to making a thong convert out of me!  They will definitely be my go-to underwear of choice when I'm wearing certain types of clothes and need to avoid the dreaded VPL.  I adored them so much that I've already purchased a couple more pairs.

Hanky Panky definitely lives up to its catch-phrase: ""World's Most Comfortable Thong.""

Grade: A",B000144RHC
"I had bought a pair of low rise hanky panky for rock climbing but I thought it would be nice to try the original too.
I love them both, depending on what I'm wearing. They are so comfortable.
I now have 4 pairs, and will buy more.
I have been washing them in the regular wash in a laundry bag with no problems so far.",B000144RHC
It is like these thongs are not even made of material at all...invisible to touch...great underneath clothing and very easy to care for - DO NOT DRY!!!,B000144RHC
"it was nice, but it ripped quickly.",B000144RHC
Very disappointed. I never received the red pair I paid for.,B000144RHC
I am a size 10 and these for great!,B000144RHC
I never was comfortable in any thong before these. I have purchased several now and intend to buy more. I'm a 10/12 with extra around the middle and these are very comfortable.,B000144RHC
Have not worn them.  My wife likes them.  lol.  downside... They get stuck in my teeth. LOL,B000144RHC
"Very comfortable, but expensive considering the material used.",B000144RHC
Love this brand of panty.  Just wish it was a bit less expensive.,B000144RHC
"Left the thong wearing when I entered my 50's.  These are incredible and necessary for certain clothes ( no panty lines). Very comfy. Does not feel like a thong. Highly recommend.  I'm 5'5"", 140lbs. Great fit- even if I was larger, the fit, I can tell, would still be perfect. It's the quality and type  of the lace used.  It has plenty of give. These are a win.",B000144RHC
I love this brand! They are the most comfy underwear I own.,B000144RHC
Hanky panky original thongs are the BEST EVER. Most comfortable thongs in the world! They are a bit expensive but well worth buying.,B000144RHC
Very comfortable. My new favorite underwear!,B000144RHC
These are the MOST comfortable panties I have ever worn. They are great for hot weather and are so soft. Never binding and they wash well.,B000146FQS
...I have ever worn. I hope they keep making them forever!,B000146FQS
"I upgraded my review after wearing these for quite some time now and comparing these with other. In hot, sweaty Florida, I prefer wearing all cotton. These are soft and relatively delicate, but stay in place fairly well. Like others have said, the elastic isn't overbearing--doesn't dig into your skin too much. I will order more of these after all. I also Vanity Fair Illumination string bikini, but it isn't all cotton.",B000146FQS
These are so comfortable!  They are so soft!  I keep purchasing more! Love them!,B000146FQS
"Kind of cheeky, don't want to spend all day adjusting a wardrobe malfunction",B000146FQS
More comfortable than a thong & they don't show panty lines.,B000146FQS
Not happy! The material is very thin and the trim low quality.,B000146FQS
"Super soft material, but elastic too light along waste band. The edges are pilling.  Look way too worn for being so new.  I like them but won't buy them again.",B000146FQS
"Horrible fit, very unflattering. Almost like a thong and loose fitting.",B000146FQS
My favorite brand. I love these things.,B000146FQS
"LOVE these - wish they made them in COLORS again!  No lines, all cotton, not your granny panties and so comfotable!",B000146FQS
Comfort high quality cotton at reasonable price,B000146FQS
"I like both the cotton and mesh on gossamer bikini underwear. They are elastic enough not to dig into my ""hip fat"" so look smooth under my clothes. The cotton stand up to washer and dryer better than the mesh. The mesh bikini air dry very quickly and last a long time if you hang dry after putting them in the washer. Highly recommend.",B000146FQS
"I got two of these panties after reading other reviews. Yes, they are indeed nice and comfortable. However, the trims on the panties came off in several places after the first wash. It is ridiculous to pay $16 for THIS kind of quality. I am very disappointed!",B000146FQS
"I have read reviews of On Gossamer's bikini being very very good. But quite frankly for the price, I was skeptical. When amazon had a multiple-buy sale, I said, heck, why not? give it a try. I am impressed - the cotton is very thick and workmanship is high quality. Each bikini is individually wrapped around a cardboard and plastic - sounds great, but perhaps we should worry about sustainability. They are cut a bit big so sizing needs some experimentation. It's rare to find all cotton bikinis these days - I highly recommend this one.",B000146FQS
These fell apart in less than two months! Horrible quality,B000146FQS
This panty is fine. Runs a little big. The fabric is not that soft but probably sturdy.,B000146FQS
"Disappointed...The material and quality of these have changed.  Two pair of these have already come apart at the seams, after only being washed three times.",B000146FQS
"Super comfortable. Fit as expected. Bought three pairs over time, will definitely purchase more in the future.",B000146FQS
most comfortable no-show briefs I've ever worn!,B000146FQS
"I love these. To the point that they are pretty much the only underwear I'll wear. They are comfy and soft, and they don't dig in and cause lines. I see that some people feel like they are not durable enough.  I did just have a couple pairs wear out, which motivated me to come and order more.  I see my last order was in 2011!!! I'd say six years of wear is enough.  I do have quite a few pairs to rotate through, but it's still a loooong time.",B000146FQS
"High quality.  Soft cotton....unlike store brand panties.
Price was high for (1) pantie.",B000146FQS
The perfect coverage. Ordered a few last year and just ordered more because I'm using them daily.,B000146FQS
"Light as air. They do their job. Somehow Loose and tight, haven't figured that out.",B000146FQS
Great fitting panties. Very smooth and soft and leaves no visible panty line. I love them!,B0001451MM
Extremely comfortable. Fit well. Wash and dry well and did not shrink.,B0001451MM
Very comfortable and soft (washer/ dryer safe) but fits a little smaller than expected. Also runs short.,B0001451MM
Love these hard to find undies. The fabric is soft and the elastic secure but chafe free. But the best part is the asset accentuating back seam! Don't know why more panties aren't made this way. Hope Felina never discontinues them.,B0001451MM
"The Felina So Smooth Hi-Cut black Panty (in XL) are so light, I forget I'm wearing underwear. They don't ride up, but sit perfectly on the body and stay in place. After wearing the first pair, I bought 5 or 6 more black pairs through amazon, and then bought blue striped, orange, and beige Felina Sublime Hi-Cut panties, which were all on sale on amazon. The blue-striped feel even lighter against the skin. They're all so much better than thongs! Every single Felina panty was perfectly comfortable to wear when temperatures stayed between 89-103 degrees for several months, whether I was wearing dresses or pants. (And no panty lines showing, either.) I machine-wash them on gentle cycle, then hang them on a drying rack--doesn't take long till they're ready to wear again. Highly recommend both Felina So Smooth and Felina Sublime Hi-Cut panties!",B0001451MM
Fit as expected - very comfortable & good quality!,B0001451MM
"I love this style and brand of panties. They are lightweight and don't leave visible lines under clothing. They wash and (line) dry well. They are reasonably priced. The only downside is the scratchy tag, which I cut out.",B0001451MM
I love these. They never cut and bind. I have tons of them. Expensive but worth it in comfort.,B0001451MM
This is awesome bikini underwear for a guy.  There is enough material present to stretch and hold your parts.  The high cut legs also fit nicely and full coverage in back makes it just settle and you can forget you are even wearing underwear. The elastic around the waste and legs is minimal and holds with just the right amount of tension and pressure.  The modal material is cool and is incredibly soft.  I just ordered more...,B0001451MM
I have worn felina for years and was excited to see them on amazon.  They fit perfectly and I will definitely buy them again!,B0001451MM
"Simple,Nice Cut,Breathable. It could use to sit a little tighter on the butt,it's not like a saggy grandma pantie but it would just be more geared towards young women if it had a more ""wedgie"" style. They're very flattering.",B0001451MM
These are the most comfortable panties!  I wish I had 10 more pair just like them!,B0001451MM
"I discovered Felina once at Costco (of all places) and never saw them there again, but fell in love with the 97% modal fabric. These are without a doubt the most comfortable panties I have ever worn. Ever.",B0001451MM
"I was reluctant to buy these because of the ""one size"" fit and because of how much they cost, but I'm happy to say they really do fit  wonderfully and they are worth every penny! They are amazingly comfortable and surprisingly durable...lace panties never last when you wash and dry them with the rest of your laundry, and lets be real, who has time to was all of their underwear separately? But these panties hold up! What's better than a sexy pair of thongs that hold up in the wash and fit like they are made for your body? I love them and recommend them wholeheartedly.",B000144RAO
"These are my favorites!  Have many pair now and highly recommend to
anyone who wants comfortable yet sexy lingerie.  Buy them in many colors!",B000144RAO
"I have been wearing Hanky Panky for a few years and continue to be satisfies with the fit and comfort as well as the look. A bit pricey, I think, but that seems to be about the cost of nice thongs found in department stores.",B000144RAO
"My wife loved these. Not only did she enjoy the look but finds these to be so comfortable that she will wear them daily. Whether you want to impress before bedtime or feel comfortable and sexy during the day, these will fit your needs!",B000144RAO
Not very substantial; I usually wear a medium (size 6) but this seemed small. Probably best for a devoted thong wearer which I am not.,B000144RAO
The BEST thongs in the world!  I have hooked many of my friends on these because they are so comfortable--you don't feel like you are wearing a thong at all!,B000144RAO
"I picked this over the low-rise because many people were saying that the low-rise is much, much too low.

Unfortunately, as a younger person, the rise on this is much, much too high -- if pulled up so the fabric lies flat, it sits about 1.5"" under my belly button (I am 5'7"").

Go with the low rise, if you were born after 1985.",B000144RAO
Pretty...nice fit...well made...,B000144RAO
Awesome undies.....and Im very picky!,B000144RAO
"I'm a die-hard fan of Hanky Panky's, and recently made it my mission to collect every color they offer. They fit most sizes (if you're over a size 16, they do have plus size!), and are so comfortable, it's like your butt cheeks are being caressed by angels. I've given these as gifts to girlfriends over the years several times, and every single time my friends rave over how much they love these panties. Sexy, comfortable and affordable - what more could you ask for?",B000144RAO
"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE these thong panties.  Discovered them about 2 years ago.  No other thong I've purchased since then has even come CLOSE to being as comfortable as these (and usually the word ""thong"" and ""comfortable"" are not typically found together in the same sentence!!). These are really the bees knees in thongs.  NONE other can compare.  They ARE pricey, I agree, but if taken care of (I do NOT put mine in the dryer!), they will last forever.  I just can't wear any other brand of thongs anymore after wearing these.  They have SUCH a nice stretch and give to them, too.  I don't know HOW they fit from a size 2 through a size 14, but I know they do, because I'm now a size 14 (5'7 and 175 lbs).... but prior to being out on a HORRID medication which caused me to gain 55 pounds, I was a size 2 (5'7 and 120 lbs)....so I know they fit from at least a size 2 through a size 14!  I personally love the ""chai"" color. Very neutral and very pretty.  I know that's probably their most popular color.  I also like the slate gray color, too (a medium shade of gray). But, the chai colored thong is absolutely PERFECT to wear in the summertime under ANY white pants or white crops or white leggings or ANYTHING white.  They just disappear.  No panty lines AND no color bleeding through.  Perfect color.  Love these.  HIGHLY recommend.  You will NOT be disappointed.",B000144RAO
"All the reviews I'd seen were raving about these (and that you could barely feel them) so I decided to try a pair to wear with leggings. They fit well, are soft, and very cute, but I feel like I have a wedgie! I could only wear them a minute before it drove me crazy and I took them off. If you're used to thongs though, this may be good for you.",B000144RAO
"These really are comfortable, flattering, and a good quality brand of panties. I usually can't stand wearing thongs, but I love these and will be purchasing more pairs.",B000144RAO
I love these panties...so comfortable,B000144RAO
These are the most comfortable panties ever!,B000144RAO
"It's still a thong.  It fits like a thong, and it is not as comfortable as they all say.  I wear a size 8.",B000144RAO
"The panties are pretty but a little large for me.  Still wearable, but not exactly what I was looking for.",B000144RAO
"These are great.  A tad on the large side, since one size fits all, but the lace lays flat and has yet to lose its stretch (I don't dry them in the dryer and they are dry in short order just hanging them up). Many colors to choose from, and no dreaded visible panty line!",B000144RAO
These underwear are so comfortable! They don't ride up or bunch at all. I have tried many other thongs and have cleaned out my drawer except for these. They are long-lasting and worth the price tag.,B000144RAO
These have been my favorites for a long long time. They are by far the most comfortable best thongs and underwear ever!!,B000144RAO
"I have never gone wrong with a pair of Hanky Panky.  Great quality, hold up over many washes and the fit is just right.",B000144RAO
I believe that the thong fit a variety of women. The description is misleading and I had to return. I am also not sure if the company will refund my purchase as I have not heard from them since I returned in October 2013. A possible waste of my money!,B000144RAO
i wear a size 10 or 12 in jeans...but these are too small..they are advertized as i size fits all...not true.....if that was so then they should have fit me  alex stone,B000144RAO
"So far these have lived up to the hype. I've only worn them a couple times. They're comfortable and fit well. Invisible under clothes. I was concerned about the hand wash instructions because, let's face it, who wants to hand wash their underwear? So far, they've held up well in the in a garment bag on hand wash cycle in my machine. Then I lay flat to dry.",B000144RAO
"I don't like thongs.  But I understand that sometimes they're a necessity.  Someone recommended this particular thong to me, so I shelled out the $18.  I put it on and the first thing I realized was: it feels like a thong.  There's just no escaping that.  BUT, once I accepted and moved past that fact, I was able to sit on uncomfortable bleachers during my son's karate practice, do 45 minutes of pilates, cook dinner, and even take a nap without being utterly miserable like I usually am with this type of underwear.  Ergo, I count it as a success.  If I have to wear a thong, this i s the thong I'll be wearing.",B000144RAO
"You won't find a better fitting or more comfortable pair on the market. The lace is soft, and the style provides excellent coverage. These are definitely worth the money.",B000144RAO
"Favorite panties ever!!  I buy them here when I can find them in a color I want and price lower than the standard $20+.
Super comfy, barely can feel them on.  If you are not a ""thong"" wearer (I wasn't) these are not the typical thong.  Nothing goes in between my cheeks at all.  Covers enough of my bum for me to be comfortable and the front coverage is generous.
I recommend for first time trying the thong or anyone who already wears thongs - but most of the veterans will already know these are awesome.",B000144RAO
Comfortable and they seem to be well made. Very happy with them so far.,B000144RAO
"very comfortable. the back is wider than most thongs, but very comfortable and stretchy",B000144RAO
"Only brand I wear. Comfy, sexy, wash in shower or on delicate in washing machine. Like not wearing anything!",B000144RAO
"My wife is extremely...EXTREMELY picky when it comes to clothing of any sort, especially underwear. She absolutely loved this pair that I ordered for her. She says that they fit better than any other thong she's tried and that they don't ride up like other thongs do. They also look great on her. I bought her one pair to see how well she liked them, now that I know, we will be ordering more.",B000144RAO
Fits my GF's posterior very well. The more conservative cut is way sexy then the string units she sometimes wears.  She likes that it does bind in certain areas & is soft.,B000144RAO
"I wear a Rago Hi Waist Long Leg panty girdle every day, all day. No zippers, no need for panties, no need to
wear stockings. I put on in the morning, it has a very convenient crotch, and it does not ride up, roll over
or show. the tummy tamer panel gives me a flat tummer. It is very firm at first, then comfortable, and then I
really forget that I have it on. My girdle experience is very positive - it is undetectable and I would not
even think of leaving home without being girdled. I am not at all self conscious and consider the wearing of
shapewear by a man to be a most normal thing.",B000147990
"A lot of how this piece of shapewear is going to fit depends on your butt and the length of your torso.  I have a slightly shorter than average torso, but also a slightly larger than average butt.  So, in the front, the shapewear comes up to my bra, but in the back it hovers only a couple inches above my natural waist, meaning I have a bit of a bulge over the top of the shorts in the back.  If only it was a little bit longer in the torso back there!  Then I'd get the all over slimming effect I was hoping for.  As is, I don't have any muffin top on my thighs and my waist is nicely slimmed.  In addition, it's comfortable, relatively pretty, and has the added bonus of garter hooks for stockings (which I love!).  The slit crotch is also handy.  I find that the back-muffin is reduced if I correct my posture and don't slouch, but I'm not used to having perfect posture all the time, like I did when I was younger.  Ideally, this piece of shapewear would do exactly what I had hoped it would, but as is, it's still a pretty good pice of shapewear and I do recommend it.",B000147990
"Pros:
 >This product provides a lot of support
 >Has a great little hidden pee vent
 >Looks a lot nicer than the photograph
 >Works great around the hips and for fitting into jeans
 >Provides decent back support

Cons:
 >Definitely runs on the small size (I bought a size up, but I wish I'd made that 2)
 >Despite nice loose rubber lace edges to smooth out the lines, still leaves very noticeable indentation rings right in the middle of the thigh
 >Distributes tummy above the top resulting in a very noticeable spare tire tummy above the waist (looks extremely odd and noticeable)
 >Permanent metal garter clasps that can be painful

Sum:
 Probably good if you just want to fit into jeans, but buy at least one size up, and don't even think about wearing under any but the loosest clothing and probably with a jacket.",B000147990
"This was worth every penny. I especially like the ""secret pocket"" in the crotch that allows ease of going to the potty. I would recommend this to anyone who has a lot of ""junk in the trunk""!",B000147990
The product came right on time. It was a perfect match as to what i ordered. The prise was unbelievable and it fit perfectly.,B000147990
"This is by far the best slimming product I bought. It is best when it comes to slimming the waist and hips but it is not very high waist.

Order a smaller size than yours for best results.",B000147990
"I followed the size chart, but this was entirely too small. Not even close to fitting.",B000147990
Most flattering shapeware. I was recommended this brand from a bridal salon while trying on wedding dresses.,B000147990
"I bought this to wear under my wedding dress, and WOW, I am impressed. The quality is beautiful; it has a retro look and is much more attractive than other shape-wear (important for wedding day use!). There is some boning across the front, and rubber gripping around the thighs and waist. This is not going to roll down, or roll up - it feels SUPER secure like you're really locked into place. It is tough to get on, so be prepared for that, but once it is in place it feels great. I don't have too many ""lumps"" but it does a great job of smoothing everything out and will be the perfect base layer for my wedding dress. Highly recommend!",B000147990
Every girdle I own by Rago is amazing. As long as you follow the size chart they fit perfect and just give me so much more confidence in my clothes!,B000147990
I ordered this according to the size chart I'm 180 5.5 waist 37 hips 44 I ordered 2xl to get a lil bit compression it came in  very timely and beautiful but 2xl was way to comfortable so I Just ordered the Xl and see wat happens .. No back fat with this I may keep for every stay but if the Xl is comfortable enough I'll return thus one I luv this item so far I'll c how it will hold up,B000147990
Finally found the right fit thanks to some other reviewers. I wear size a 8-10 pants and bought the large. Pretty comfortable for shape wear and the french lace holds you  in pretty good.,B000147990
Love this shapewear! Keeps you tight and tucked in where you need it and doesn't scrunch up. Wore this underneath my wedding gown the entire day and it held in place even after all the dancing!,B000147990
Excellent hold; the best shapewear Ive ever bought (& Ive tried a few inc. spanx)  just ordered a second one. Glad I read the reviews though as it fits a little small. Im usually a small in most things...52 35# size 4-6 but after reading others comments ordered a medium...so happy I did...after all I do like to breathe occasionally.,B000147990
"This product is pretty well made, but not $40 worth.  I returned mine -- i liked the way it looked and felt, but it did not suck in the pooch.  It only sucks in where that shape is above the crotch. a bit strange.",B000147990
"Ive been on the search for a thigh and tummy slimmer that fit all of my criteria, and this one finally checked off all my boxes! Im fairly small, and this actually does slim me, rather than just smooth things out. The legs don't cut in at all, and leave a smooth line without rolling up. Most of all, Im fairly long-torsoed, and it comes up to my bra band so there isn't a gap. The construction is high quality, and, though it does take some shimmying to get on, it isn't so difficult to get in and out of that it would make bathroom trips an issue. Overall, though I cant speak to the larger sizes, if you're on the slim side and looking for a firm shaper, this is amazing. For reference, Im 58, 27 waist and 36 hip.",B000147990
I was worried that it wouldn't fit since a lot of people said that the sizes run small but it fits perfect! It  definitely runs true to size. It is a challenge to get on since there is no zipper or tie but once it's on it fits perfect and comfortably. It is really hard to find cute white shapewear so I'm really glad i found this brand. I will definitely recommend this product to all my bridesmaids.,B000147990
"I bought these to wear with my wedding dress. I am totally ok being uncomfortable if I look amazing. However, these add bulk and the hooks on the inside of the garment are more that I can bare. They dig into your skin. They were tight but I did not get the seamless shape I was after.",B000147990
"Pros:
- These are extremely comfortable, which was unexpected!
- Love the lace leg trimming since other shapewear with a straight leg bottom all cuts into my thighs which causes ugly bumps.
- Vintage design.
- Smooths everything out.
- Extremely high waisted (I have a short to medium length torso though).

Cons:
- Very difficult to pull up the first time, but it got better even on the second time trying on (would really prefer it to have a zip).
- The reason they get a star removed is due to the unusable crotch opening that doesn't exactly work as its intended purpose.
Otherwise, these are the best shapewear shorts I've ever tried.",B000147990
"SPANX Women's Higher Power Shorts, Soft Nude, Large VS. Rago Women's Hi Waist Long Leg Shaper, Beige, Large (30)

All the wedding dress shopping articles tell you to wear the undergarments you are planning to wear on the day to the fittings, so I ordered shapewear in preparation for my dress fitting appointment. The two main recommendations were SPANX (an obvious choice as this brand has become synonymous with shapewearlike Kleenex and tissue) and Rago. Most of the reviews I read highly recommended Rago so I ordered comparable options in both; high waist and mid thigh.

I wasn't looking for a lot of shaping help. I consider myself very body positive. I love my curves and just wanted to smooth out my silhouette a tad (I mean I am spending a lot of money on pictures and a dress).

The Rago are well constructed and beautiful. They have boning and are made of sturdy elastic lace. They also have clasps for stockings which is very cool. They are very difficult to get on and off and I was very worried about ripping the more delicate areas of the lace (I believe they are much sturdier than they appear though). The lace was itchy but not so bad that I believe you wouldnt get used to it. The boning at the top gives me great confidence that the waist band would not roll down. The tummy panel and the structuring on the sides and back works very well to elevate and compliment your curves.

The SPANX are made of a very comfortable elastic material like very thick nylons. They are very comfortable and easy to pull on. They hold everything in place and smooth out the lines of your body without overly changing your silhouette. The waistband has a think gel strip along the top that prevents the top from curling down (I read many reviews that pointed to SPANX having this problem compared to Rago). I moved around a lot while I tried these on to see if the top would roll down and it did not. The thigh section is thicker than the top and I didn't observe any problems with the ends rolling up either. I believe if you size these correctly you will have no problem with them rolling or sliding out of place.

Both pairs of shapewear feature a split crotch so that they do not need to be removed to go to the restroom (I read a few review where Rago was recommended for having these over SPANX so maybe SPANX has recently added this feature).

For my needs I will be keeping the SPANX. I prefer less shape help but would highly recommend the RAGO to anyone that feels more comfortable with more support! The SPANX also feel more comfortable to me and I have very sensitive skin (I do believe that people with normal skin would find the Rago brand comfortable but I feel that it will drive me crazy).

I think that Rago are a very good deal for the price as they are very well constructed and very attractive.",B000147990
"I'm undecided about keeping this. Pros are: 1) the hooks for attached hosiery are a great additional bonus. They show as a bump if you wear the shaper under pants, but you can remove the hooks and just the little fabric tags are left inside. 2) Design doesn't cause much muffin-top, as it swoops much lower in the back than the front, so back-fat isn't squished between top of shaper and bra. 3) Lace and overall design is very pretty. 4) Opening for using the toilet included (ESSENTIAL to me in shapewear)! Cons are: 1) Lace material is quite stiff/scratchy. Might improve with washing, but I won't know because I can't wash it if I choose to return. 2) Smallest size doesn't offer as much compression as some other shapers, but this costs more. I am not tiny (5' 3"", 130 lbs., 28"" waist, 38"" hips), but I think an x-small would work better if it were offered. 3) Boning in the front is kind of long if you have a really short torso like I do (ok when standing but digs in when sitting).",B000147990
"I bought this to wear under my wedding dress and it worked like a charm! I would recommend wearing it around the house a couple times to stretch it out a bit because it's really tight. After I wore it a couple times, it was comfortable by the time I had my wedding. It keeps all the rolls in! The only hard thing is getting it on, so be patient!",B000147990
The large size was way too small.  There was no way to calculate size on the website. Item was returned.  Order similar garments also designated large from another site and they fit perfectly.  Wont order from this company again,B000147990
I like the product  but it a little small.... how can I send it back there were no return lable,B000147990
"Perfect support, very comfortable",B000147990
The material is very scratchy. I love how firm and shaping it is. But it's made from such an uncomfortable material that I only wear it if I don't have another option.,B000147990
"I went up a size from my normal size, as suggested. It still fit very snug, but definitely flattened my belly & made my wedding dress look great!",B000147990
I tried these on with my wedding dress at my final fitting yesterday and they worked perfectly. They shape me nicely without making me feel like a sausage.,B000147990
it has wiriing!!! no where advertised...,B000147990
"These fit as expected, according to the sizing chart listed. They do not roll down which is awesome! I personally love the ""trap door"" crotch which makes it waaaay easier to go to the bathroom when you're in a fancy dress. In general I am a big fan of foundational garments and I really like these for form-fitting dresses and skirts.",B000147990
"I run about a medium in bottoms, but I ordered this in a large. Turns out that was a great idea. You need it to run a little big so that you can pull it over to wear. I would say getting it on was the hardest part. Once on, it fit fantastic. It slimmed my tummy and thighs under my wedding gown perfectly. The lace makes it really pretty. The best part - there's a slit in the crotch area, so you can use the bathroom with no hassle. Genius! Highly recommend this piece.",B000147990
"AMAZING SHAPEWEAR!!! I Heard about this in a Facebook group I'm in for fashionistas (lol)/ the poster said that it was better than Spanx as it not only smooths you in, but also sculpts your curves. She could not be more right!! No rolling down or curling like Spanx does- and it is actually more comfortable (I wouldn't say it is comfortable but what shapewear is?). LOVE!!!

I took one star off because it makes a swish noise when you walk due to the fabric. Not that big a deal though",B000147990
These work great at smoothing out my hip/stomach area but it does leave a bulge at the top in the upper back area.,B000147990
extremely hard to get into it I am usually a small and small was way to tight the fabric is not soft so order larger size,B000147990
"I've ordered Rago's Women's High-Waisted Long Leg Shaper before, so I know how its sizing works. Rago's sizing is closer to vintage sizing. You can't order your normal dress size in Rago. The company doesn't vanity size like most modern women's clothing companies. You must order this shapewear based on your hip size, which is what I did. That means I ordered two sizes larger than my dress size. Once on, the shaper feels very firm and smooths me out under my dresses and skirts. Despite the compression, I find it very comfortable  to wear. Major tip: the hosiery clasps are detachable.",B000147990
"I bought this shapewear because I've got that post-baby mom belly that I wanted to smooth down in order to wear my usual vintage dresses. I LOVE the way the Rago works to shape and smooth, and keep everything from being a jiggly mess. It's comfortable, and especially in tandem with the longline bra, it's great for vintage lovers and getting a good shape underneath vintage garments. At first, I thought it was near perfect. The legs didn't roll up, I wasn't constantly tugging and pulling to adjust myself, all was good. My only complaint was that, being a woman with a 18"" difference between my waist and hips, the waist was a little loose and tended to fold/wrinkle under waistlines.

But after semi-daily wear (3-4x a week) for a month or two now, the rubberized lines inside the lace around the legs has all but disintegrated, much to my dismay, and the legs now roll up almost immediately. I had high hopes for the wearability, but I can't really wear these if I'm going to sit at all, because of the legs. Hopefully I can repair that.

As well, the lace starts to get a bit stringy here and there, so now when I pull them on my wedding ring gets caught by loose strings.

All in all, if you're going to wear these on occasion, they're great for shaping. But for anyone who wishes to wear them daily or semi-daily, they're not the best option, sadly.",B000147990
I wish I had taken a photo. I am 5'0 120lbs. I ordered a medium. The product is called Hi waist Long Leg shaper. The legs were LONG - Past my knees. The product photo shows the shorts hitting mid thigh. This is not the case for the product I received. I returned and opted to buy a pair of hi waist Spanx shorts.,B000147990
"Def worth the money, fits well and does what I needed it to do! Sculpted my body in all the right spots!",B000147990
"My measurements are 5'0 and 117 pounds, and I got the small (26) it was tight but as tight as any spanx in my size. It's super comfortable but provides a level of support that I've never seen from any other product of its kind. It really sucks in my lower midsection which spanx never did because it's got boning in it. It redifines my waist and doesn't just smooth me out. It shapes me. It's amazing. It's also so pretty on. I love it. Don't size up because if not, it won't actually shape you as well. It's comfortable once on. It's not fragile so you can get it on without any risk of ripping it.",B000147990
"I had been looking for a girdle to give me support and to disguise figure flaws for awhile. Nothing quite fit the bill until by chance I happened to notice Rago,  At the time my waist was 32 inches. I had read the reviews and was tempted to go up a size. I am glad I didn't. I got the XL.  It was exactly what I had been looking for. It gave me the support that I had been looking for. When I pair it with a long line bra I get a very nice silhouette. I have also gotten the  Rago panty girdles. My waist  is now 26 inches and I wear the small. Rago girdles are the only ones I wear. It is an added bonus that it is made in the US.",B000147990
Ladies if you want comfort and support this is the girdle for you I am 264 pounds I ordered the 3 / 3/6 and it fit perfect and it's very comfortable breathable lightweight and has a surprise pocket at the bottom where you don't have to take the girdle off you can use the bathroom just pull it to the side I love this girdle and I will be ordering another one in every color,B000147990
"I love the Rago '6207' shaper.  It gives me a perfect fit and very comfortable control.
The high waist does -NOT- roll down and I can wear this shaper under anything.

This style hugs my legs closely but I wear it all day at the office.

The sizing is based on your waist, not your hips or thighs.
For me, the best choice was to measure my waist size and subtract 3 inches.

Perfect!",B000147990
"This shape wear runs small.  I usually wear a size medium, so I ordered medium and I couldn't get it over my thighs.  The beige color is not a true beige or cream.  It has a strange yellow tone to it and the fabric was very stiff.",B000147990
Maybe I got the wrong size but I am a 2/4 normally and it just didn't seem to fit right.,B000147990
Could be stronger. Otherwise very good,B000147990
"These will work out perfectly under my wedding dress. I tried a few different options that would work for my low back strapless dress and these are the winner. I needed something that was not too high, because the back dips down to about mid-back. Everything else I tried squished me too much that all my fat spilled out the top, and would have looked even worse under the dress than if I was wearing nothing!

These were harder to put on than any others I tried, but once they were up, the back squish is very minimal. They flatten my tummy pooch perfectly and I have a nice smooth hourglass shape. I'm about 5'3"", and the front come up to right under my bra line. The back is a bout 1""-2"" lower than the dress. I am very please with these!

I bought a size medium. I am usually a 4 or 6 in clothing.",B000147990
I can't recommend these enough!,B000147990
holds firm. shows through clothes,B000147990
"I think it was a bit small but with enough pulling and wiggling I got it on. I am 5'4"" and 154 lbs and kinda pear shaped. It holds well and is surprisingly comfortable. Hope this helps.",B000147990
"These are comfortable and shaping, with different effects on my front and back. The leg elastic stays in place without digging in.",B000147990
"This is the shape wear of all shape wear. I got a size XL originally and it sucked me in all the right places (aka stomach).  After trying on my dress and still not being super happy (with my body not the shape wear) I thought I would say screw it and bought a large as well to see if it helped more.  At my next fitting I felt like it looked so much better.  It is obviously hard to get on but once it's there it's worth it.  The hole in the crotch area is plenty big to pee out of unlike spanks.  For reference, am 5'5"" 165 lbs and carry most of my weight in my lower stomach and butt.  I was worried it would give me a flat grandpa butt but it didn't at all. I had a silk like gown that was very thin and the rago did not show through at all.",B000147990
I normally wear a 1X. Ordered a 2X and could not get it on. It looks well made bur runs small.,B000147990
"I wore this under my wedding dress and I felt like a superstar in it.  It was admittedly a little bit of a struggle to get on, as it is tight, but the whole point of it is to squeeze and shape- so duh!  I like that the waist came up to my natural waist and that the  elastic portions contour my curves in a natural yet effective way.  The opening in the crotch made taking a wee much less of a process and the silicone strips in the legs kept them in place.  These prevented some painful chub rub, which is something no bride has time for.  It was invisible under my gown and did not constrict any breathing the way some previous cinchers have.  This product is not cheap but it is worth it for an important event where you want your rolls to be flat and smooth.  This thing is no joke and is hands down the best cincher I have tried.",B000147990
These are awesome. It completely took away the belly button line I hate so much!! highly recommend. Put my other spanx to shame.,B000147990
"These have excellent compression, but were unfortunately not high waisted enough!  And I'm not particularly long torso-ed.

A high waist shorts shaper should come up to the ribs, so you can tuck it under your bra, and try to create a somewhat seamless transition along your bra fat area.  These only came up to my natural waist, and also had a ~2"" height difference between the front and the back (much lower in the back, and I've only got an average sized booty).  Because of the shortness of the garment, it created a terrible muffin zone between where the Rago shorts stopped and my bra started.  Yuck!",B000147990
"It fits snug but the compression is great, especially in the lower tummy.",B000147990
"This held me in nicely and smoothed out some lines and lumps, however the boning it is very obvious.  It also makes it more difficult to get on than your usual shaper.  I had a dress that was close to a thick jersey material, and depending on how I stood you could see the lines of the boning.  Would rather have had a little less support and had a smoother look (and feel). Probably great under pants or a thicker material dress, but still difficult to get on/off.",B000147990
"Arrived quickly and is exactly what the other reviews said it is -- more girdle than shaper, but seems to be pretty comfortable, has the stocking clips, and will surely get the job done when I have to wear it under a bridesmaid's dress. I am a size 14/16 with a belly pooch and ordered the 2X/Large (34), on other reviewers' advice; it pulls my waist in an inch or more but yet doesn't seem to bind anywhere once I get it on. That would be the hard part -- it is a fight to get it all the way on and correctly positioned, but afterward you feel pretty bulletproof.

UPDATE: Sailed through the wedding and reception wearing this thing! Didn't give it a thought once I had it on (baby powder makes it easier). I was a bit freaked out to use the slit when I had to use the restroom, but it was well-designed and plenty big, so that peeing was achieved quickly and without accident or incident. Incredibly pleased with this purchase. Upgrading to five stars!",B000147990
"First, this runs super small! I ordered and XL because I read that it runs small and I would normally fit a large. So I went a size up thinking it would work. Plus if it's tight that's fine because I want it to hold me in well. Well I couldn't even get this up past my thighs. And I don't have big thighs at all. It was wayyyy too small. But I could tell from how far I did get it up that it was going to be a really good product as long as I could get it in the right size. But luckily returns are really easy and I can try to order again.",B000147990
"True to sizing chart I got the 2xl and it's a bit of a struggle to get in, but once in it's comfortable.  I have a vintage wiggle dress and the hips were too tight, it was fine standing and walking ,but if I sat down I felt it could rip it.  Put these underneath and voila , room to sit as it sucks the bum into the right shape etc.  defiantly going to get the black also but when I lose a couple of kilos.  I am 5ft 3, a size 32 waist and 44 inch hip and the 2xl fit great.",B000147990
"I ordered a size up based on the reviews and it fit well, but I could never wear this under a dress.  The seams were much too thick and could be seen very obviously.  This did however, really, really constrict me and suck me in but I have decided to swear off shapers and stop torturing my body with these garments just to look a little better in my clothing.  I'm just going to buy clothing that is more conducive to my body and forget all the discomfort and expense of shapers!",B000147990
Perfect fit for a frech size 40/42 max,B000147990
"Bought for wedding dress shopping!!! It was perfect! Comfortable and pretty! I wasn't embarrassed to have it on in front of people. Slimmed and flattened just right for the form fitting dress I ended up saying yes to!! Although I only had it on for dress shopping process, I'm sure I could have kept it on for quite some time!!! Would define recommend.",B000147990
"Considering it being very snug, it's a beautiful and supporting shaper",B000147990
"If you are overweight or have excess skin, these WILL cause a ""muffin-top"".",B000147990
"Nicely made, but runs much smaller than expected.",B000147990
"I've owned Rago products for the last 4 years. They work better than Spanx and are true to size. They never fail to disappoint and I feel so sexy when I wear them. Highly recommend these, they hold up well. I wash on the delicate cycle and hang dry. They last forever!",B000147990
Stays in place does not roll down at the tummy or roll up in the legs. Very Comfortable material lays very nicely under other garments.,B000147990
This shaper definitely packs a punch. Fits snug but that's it's job.,B000147990
"Although it is well made and offers extra firm control, I should have listened to the reviews: the material is stiff and scratchy; very uncomfortable for daily wear. The shaper runs small. I weigh116 lbs and ordered a Medium. It took 10 minutes to get in on; going to the bathroom would be a nightmare. It may work for some women, but not for me. Returned it the following day.",B000147990
"I wear a size 6-8 and the size medium is hard to put on, but WOW, my clothes fit great, my tummy is completely flat (I'm 55 yrs old) and it is not uncomfortable at all. This is my 3rd one to purchase. I have found that after about 6 - 8 months of wearing 3 X a week the elastic in the bottom part of the legs starts to fray and and get a little loose. But all of this support for this price...I'm totally satisfied. I do roll it down to use the bathroom and it easily comes back up.",B000147990
"Way too tight, stiff and scratchy and hard to pull up. Wore it once and it was very uncomfortable. Too small as well. Should have sent it back.",B000147990
"This is for those who want a little more than smoothing everything out. It's pretty, though the beige color was not as soft as I thought. Much prettier than some while still doing it's job. It comes with removable garters which I like and has soft bones that do not dig in like you would expect. The material is a little scratchy, though I expect this will go away after a few washings. I am a shorter person and this comes up almost to my bra. (I like to tuck them under)  After an afternoon of wearing it, it does start to roll down if it's not tucked under. All in all, I like this shaper",B000147990
"They are hard to get one, but that is to be expected from a product like this. Once on they provide great hold, and do not roll down like many products like these do.",B000147990
Fits great and does the job it is supposed to. The lace is a little scratchy.,B000147990
I love it! Makes me look flawless under that skirts and dresses and really hold you in. So comfortable too!,B000147990
I am five for tall and 120 lbs and the medium was too small.,B000147990
"I thought I ordered a more generous size, but it was a bit difficult to get on and off, and I felt that it didn't shape as well as is could have. Plus, the hole at the bottom is a bit silly. I wish that part was designed better...",B000147990
I typically fit in Mediums so I bought this and couldn't get it over my knees. I admit that I am more of an hour glass shape but I wasn't expecting to have this be so tight. I most likely would've needed an extra large with the way the fit was going.,B000147990
"Nice high waist long leg girdle.
It is slimming with out feeling too super tight. It isn't the softest material in the world but it does breathe well.
Hope this review was helpful to you.",B000147990
"Oh my goodness! This was a fantastic purchase! After having two babies a year apart, my shape has been slow to bounce back and has been a bit pudgy. This really helped to smooth out my bumps and slim everything down. It's surprisingly comfortable as well. I can still get on the floor and wrangle kids if I need to or wear for long periods of time without being uncomfortable.",B000147990
"I should have read deeper into the comments. It did fit smaller than expected, but you can tell if fitted properly it would have done an excellent job shaping my problem areas. I wish I ordered the appropriate size because it is a great quality product.",B000147990
"Fit perfectly, comfortable to wear. No rolling down",B000147990
"I should have gone up one size. It holds you in, but after 4-5hrs it's squeezing your gut.",B000147990
"I like the way it hugs me, and the side stays, keeps the top from rolling down.",B000147990
The quality of this Rago shapewear is fine but  for some reason not as comfortable as the same Rago item I purchased in a store in my neighborhood.,B000147990
work to get it on but boy does it hold you in!,B000147990
"Way too tight to wear comfortably. They do make me slimmer but I would rather be a lumpy, chubby lady than wear them.",B000147990
"You want to order the size you want it to whittle you down to...I have about a 39""to 40"" waist.  I got the 3XL-36"" size and it shrinks my waist down to about a 38.  It's stretchy but firm.  I like the boning in the sides and front except it's plastic so it starts to conform to your body over time and the elasticity wears out...so I find myself purchasing a new one of these every few months because I wear it everyday.  But it's one of the best pieces of shape-wear I have!  I pair it up with a long line bra to eliminate bulge at the top.",B000147990
It pretty much fit as expected and held me in but it went up much higher on the front of the waist than I expected and the boning is very uncomfortable. Returned.,B000147990
"Loved the fit, how far it came up and the snaps for hose.",B000147990
Concept is great but I found myself messing with it the entire time I was wearing it. Top part dug into my rips kept having to pull down legs.,B000147990
"I absolutely LOVE this shaper. Yes, it's not the easiest item to get on, and not the most comfortable thing to wear, but it does a much better job than the regular Spanx type garment with no boning. My problem area is my hips, and this did an amazing job of pulling everything in and keeping it that way through the night. Using the restroom in it is... interesting, but much easier than if you actually had to take it off every time!

I purchased this to wear under my wedding dress and it gave me a beautiful silhouette. I've since worn it on a couple of special occasions and every time it has given me a huge confidence boost.",B000147990
"wish it was made in an extra small, but great hold!",B000147990
"This is great! It's not super uncomfortable and easy to move in. I joked to my friend after I wore it that I would wear it everyday, I haven't. I did like the smooth look it gave me. I am considering buying a black one in the future.",B000147990
"I purchased this to wear under my wedding gown, and it worked as expected. Very good tummy control, but it wasn't so tight that I couldn't breathe. I had to get my maid of honor to help me get into it, but that was fine. There is a slit at the crotch that allows you to go to the bathroom without taking the whole thing off. I managed this during my wedding by having my maid of honor hold up my dress skirt, and that freed up my hands to do the rest ; )  Also, note that the garter hooks are removable.",B000147990
I really like the quality and it seems as though it would help with my problem areas but it is way too small and I ordered a size up. Ill save it and once I lose some weight will try again .,B000147990

"This shapewear is NOT comfortable to put on, but it looks fabulous after you manage to wiggle it past your hips!  I feel really confident and secure that it gives me desirable curves and I love the high waist nature of this shaper!  I threw all of my other shapers out because this one has everything I need!

Definitely need to have patience putting this on but works great to conceal all areas needing concealing.,B000147990
"These are great shapewear, they are very structured, so they aren't the most comfortable but the boning is what creates the desired shaping. They aren't uncomfortable though they are difficult to get on and off.

The hole in the crotch is very convenient to use the bathroom and definitely a good feature that many shapers do not have.",B000147990
Great slimming and support. Rago makes fantastic shape wear & this is not different. Far superior to anything spanx makes.,B000147990
Bought this for my wedding day and I'm super satisfied! It doesn't roll down at the top and it's very comfortable.,B000147990
"I want to give it more stars, because they are super firm just like I wanted.... but too small and firm for me to get over these big hips! Oh well, I'll try another size, haven't given up yet.",B000147990
"My mother wanted to give this a go after I bragged about this shaper. It hold everything in, but it is very difficult to get on.",B000147990
"This is the first piece of shapewear that actually makes me look 10lbs thinner. Excellent extra-firm compression gave me a flat tummy, slimmer hips and smooth lines for tight dresses. Found it to be true to size. Ordered a medium and I'm a size 8. Will totally purchase more stuff from Rago.",B000147990
Perfect for my mermaid wedding dress. I loved that you couldn't see any signs of it through the dress either. Recommended to my other engaged friends :),B000147990
its shapewear so it is tight when you put on so its good to go a size up,B000147990
"I ordered two sizes bigger than my normal size and it is tight, the legs rolled up and a couple of the waist band threads were unraveling.",B000147990
"I have bought 3 items from Rago, the first one I bought a medium and it was too big, then I bought 2 small in another item and they were too small.  I wish they had consistent sizing through out their products, instead of the guessing process. Of course, the items I bought cannot be returned.  I will not be buying from this company again, since I am concerned about wasting my hard earned dollars.",B000147990
Way cuter in person and super slimming. Boning keeps it from rolling down. Will go great under my conforming low back wedding dress,B000147990
"This was an awesome shaper!!! I wanted something that would bring in my large tummy and this definitely did the trick! My high waist spanx shorts couldn't even do that!! I will be wearing it under my bodycon style dresses and this is great at smoothing out the lumps and giving me the nipped in waist I was looking for without having to use a corset. The stripes do contain some thin boning, but I couldn't see it even in my tightest dresses.
Definitely had to wiggle into it, but after that it stayed put. I like that it has garter straps so that you can wear stockings if you like. Normally I don't like sticky things on the legs like this has, but it helped the legs stay down in a way where I didn't notice it sticking to my skin at all.",B000147990
"Bought this for my wedding and loved it.  It gave me nice smooth lines under my dress and was actually comfortable to wear all day.  It didn't slip, roll down, or go anywhere else it shouldn't be.  Based on reviews and my specific measurements, I ordered one size larger than my clothing size indicated on the size chart.  Took a little effort to get it on, but loved what it did for me once it was there.",B000147990
I have been looking for something that would hold in my stomach! I have tried EVERTHING!! THIS did it! I ordered my normal size I would ware and it fit perfect!!,B000147990
I ordered 2 different sizes hoping to flatten out my muffin top. No such luck. I returned them and am still in the hunt for something that'll get the job done.,B000147990
I order this product  a size up and it's still 2 small,B000147990
very good support where expected,B000147990
went by size chart and not even close to right fit,B000147990
Mother is 81 years young and she likes these kind of shapers.,B000147990
Great product! Shape wear is often so ugly so this cute choice was great. I'm wearing them under my wedding dress and I think they will be perfect.,B000147990
"Give yourself extra time to cram into this thing and to peal out of it if you need to use the facilities.
But the results are VERY effective!
And thankfully the stocking hooks are removable, otherwise I would have have some interesting indents on my thighs.
Don't know how this will work after a day's wear as the boning or ""contour bands"" are a little prohibitive.",B000147990
"Bought this to wear under my wedding dress. I haven't tried it on with the dress yet - but after trying it on at home, it is the strongest shapewear I've ever tried and I know it's going to work great! I've tried Spanx and most other department store brands, but think this is the strongest hold I've ever had.",B000147990
"I don't really like the fit of this.  It's okay, but not the best.  The Rago open girdle is much better in my opinion.  I bought this to wear underneath  my pinup girl dresses, but I noticed you can see the lines underneath the dress.  I ended up sending it back due to the fit and look of it.

UPDATE---So, I ordered this from another site in the beige color.  I ordered it at the same time I ordered the black one from Amazon, but it took much longer to receive.  When I did receive the beige one, the fit was awesome!  I also couldn't see any lines underneath my dress.  It fit much differently than the black one I ordered thru Amazon and I couldn't understand why. I decided to give it another go and ordered it in black from Amazon again.  I just received it and it is awesome!  I was worried that it would show thru my dresses being black, but it does not.  Not sure what happened the first time, but I'm glad I decided to give it another try : )  This is actually more comfortable and easier to move in than the Rago 1294.  I also changed my review and gave it 5/5 stars instead of 3/5.  Give it a try!  I love it!",B000147990
"I bought this for a few reasons.  Going back to work postpartum and needed a little help getting back into some of my clothes.  And I needed some help with my posture.  I like the support it gives me, and as an unexpected bonus, it helps with my hypermobility issues.  Sometimes I can feel my hips and low back moving around too much and this helps keep things from getting thrown out of wack!  It is a chore to get on and off though.  I have big hips, so I have to stand with my legs apart to help stretch it on the way up.  I wish I would have got the one with a zipper, and would recommend that if you are wide hipped/small waisted.",B000147990
"Returned product. Does not fit like a large. Felt like I needed to oil up my body just to get it on. At first, once I got it on I thought ""Wow! This thing really flattens my belly and shapes great!"" Then I turned around and realized that everything that flattened out actually got pushed up and out over the top of the shaper.",B000147990
"I read the other reviews which suggested you buy your size rather than a size smaller, as it fits quite snugly. My waist measures 33in, which is between the 2X and XL, so I bought the 2X. As I am hourglass shaped, the shaper fits very snugly over my hips, giving me lovely smooth lines without any bulges there. It did not smoothen the tummy area that well, but that is probably because  I don't have much of a tummy and there wasn't as much to compress.  The shaper did not rise as high as I wanted over my back, and sadly gave me little back fat rolls between my bra band and the edge of the shaper. This problem disappears if I wear a bra with a wider back band, but am disappointed that I am limited in my bra choices.

I am very happy with the way it looks. I much prefer it to the 'flesh-toned spandex' look of other shapers, since they never match my skin tone and look like I put on someone else's dead skin. The black lace is very classy-looking and I wouldn't mind it if showed under the hem of my dresses. There is silicone lining the thigh bottom edges to keep it from rolling up. It does its job. I imagine this would work very well under trousers as well. The shaping makes you basically drop a size, so you could wear pants that might have been too snug on the hips before.

Don't forget to remove the little clips for thigh-highs that are inside the shaper legs. Though the plastic is flexible, it still feels uncomfortable and creates small odd bumps.

I hope they create the product in more colours, I would happily buy a red one. If I was into flesh-toned colours, I would probably want a darker shade than the ones they offer.",B000147990
"First,give yourself extra time (at least five minutes) to get it on.  It is a challenge.  Then again, if it just slid right on, could it really work?  And it does work.  It doesn't make you look skinny, but it does make you look thinner and it holds in the belly.  What would be better though, is if it came all the way up and was a total body shaper (and in my case, the bra would be a minimizer).  I had to buy a 'bustier-type' bra in order to cover the area between my usual bra and this shape wear.  I will add that once it was all on, I looked pretty good and forgot I was even wearing such a tight-fitting piece(s) of underwear.  Yes, I would recommend it.  Just be aware that this is not something you are going slide on or off...it's more like a struggle...but worth it--for an elegant event.",B000147990
"There is no shaper that functions better or looks more elegant than this one (even if no one is ever going to see it). Holds where it's supposed to and makes you feel like a million bucks. Just hope you don't have to use the restroom too often, since it's not the easiest to put back on once it's been rolled down (it will not simply slide down, I tried). There is a flap for those kinds of emergencies if absolutely necessary.",B000147990
Worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon.,B000147990
"I ordered my size according to their chart, but it is on the small size.  I'd recommend going one size up.",B000147990
"Better shaping than spanx by far, and better looking too!  Wore these under my wedding dress.  Comfortable, love that they don't roll up the legs or down at the waist!  I have a large ribcage and small waist, rolling down has always been a problem with shapewear.  I ordered a size smaller than what the Rago website suggested based on my measurements- definitely order down.",B000147990
I love the shape this gives me and it looks great with the long line bra.  It is comfortable all day.  The gusset is a real time saver too.,B000147990
I have been buying direct from the company. This is the first time I bought Rago from Amazon. Meet my expectation as always.,B000147990
I love Rago's body shapers. Perfect for every day wear -- especially when I want to create a classic silhouette.,B000147990
Being use it for almost a year. Amaaazing shape the body perfectly ,B000147990
"Fit's wonderfully! Does exactly what it should to give a good line under clothing. And true to claims it does not roll up or down. Be warned, the boning will encourage you to have good posture both sitting and standing.",B000147990
Love it!! Although it does run a little small. Suggest you buy one size larger.,B000147990
To let other people know my thoughts,B000147990
"I like how this holds everything in! I have sensitive skin, so I had to wear some nylon/spandex shorts underneath (by Jockey) because the lace was a little scratchy.",B000147990
"From reading other reviews, I couldn't tell if it was running too small or too big.  No one actually put their sizes.  So, here's mine:  I'm stuck somewhere between a 12 on a good day, and a 14 most days.  From the swinging reviews, I decided to order my size, L.  I didn't even pull this up past my knees before knowing I was in no way interested in the fight it would have taken, only to achieve great misery.  And yes, the fabric is scratchy and very firm.  This is a girdle.  I think what I really wanted is a shaper, but can't find just the one.  Hope this helps someone else get the right size.",B000147990
I normally am a size Med or Large and the Large was too small and not forgiving enough to put on comfortably.  ONce on it did have a tendency to roll down at the top fo the garment leavnig a high muffin top.,B000147990
"The material is too stiff for my liking but the shaper works perfectly. It tucks in all the excess flesh/fat but I hardly wear mine, it's really uncomfortable.",B000147990
This is one of the best shapewear items I own. The fit guide is misleading. I am bottom heavy and wear a 16 misses. I ordered a XL/32 and it is tiiiiight! I could bearly get it on the first time but the second time was easier. Its not high-waisted unless you hike it up yourself. The best part is this garment will really hold you in and help you get in your clothes. Another bonus is you don't see the thigh line like other shapewear. I will order this brand again but will be sure to size up,B000147990
"Definately great support-had to return/exchange due to sizing.  I would suggest ordering up.  I have a shorter, plumper body type, and feel the back side is lower.  We will see if the larger size will fit better.",B000147990
I got my size according to rago's size chart but I feel like I could've gone one size down yo get it to pull in instead of just to smooth. It is a good quality shaper and the lace is pretty. It advertises a slit to use bathroom but I don't think id feel comfortable using it without a mishap.,B000147990
"Came RIGHT ON TIME. Fits perfectly. I got a small with the open-bottom girdle, and so, I knew I could get one size up. So I got the medium with this one. It is great! I definitely recommend if you wanna feel like a 50's gal!",B000147990
"I don't like the material that it is made out of. The first time putting it on, I was afraid it would rip. I don't know how sturdy the material really is, but I'm not going to try and test it out. It's also rough and abrasive. The garter hooks (not sure if that's the correct term or not), dug into my legs. That was only after wearing it for less than a minute when I first tried it on. I ended up cutting them out. The whole get up is snug every where from torso down to thighs. Not a minute really goes by that I can't tell I'm wearing it. Some of the seams kind of cut in a little bit, leaving indentations in my skin. There's an opening at the crotch area and I'm not really sure of that purpose. I thought maybe it was in order to use the restroom without pulling the whole thing down, but I could not figure out a way to do that without making a mess somewhere (perhaps I need a funnel?). Basically, it's one of the most painful and uncomfortable body shapers I have ever worn. With all that being said, it does hold things in and flattens my stomach. This item follows the ""Beauty is Painful"" idea. If you are looking for something to take inches off, this is not it. All in all, my torso is about 1/2"" smaller. Depending on your side, rolls can hang over the top area. This item can be worn under jeans that are loose fitting. And I don't think it really does anything for my bottom. I thought it might boost it a little, but it doesn't. As for recommending this product: order at your own risk. If you want a flatten stomach and you don't mind a little pain and discomfort, this is your item.",B000147990
This feels like tight plastic tape wrapped tightly around your legs and tummy. Not a cozy fitting item I had it on no more then one minute and had to take it off.,B000147990
This does work as expected but the material is very stiff and is not as comfortable as I would like it be. The color is good for my fair skin and light clothing.,B000147990
"I wore these for the first time last night and was shocked to find the garter tabs had given me huge blisters. The garment fits well, but the compression of the tabs against the skin from being under the garment causes friction blisters with one evening of wear. I won't be able to wear these with stockings at all. That said, the tabs are removable and then you have a great piece of shapewear. Works WAY better than spanx, as I did a tape measure test. This garment took 1.5"" off my waist and hips, whereas the spanx did less than an inch.",B000147990
"I was excited when this arrived in the post. I ordered a medium although i was between a small and medium on the sizing chart. After reading other reviews i decided to go with the larger size. It fit really well. I definitely needed to wriggle around to get into it but once on it was really comfortable and stayed that way throughout the next workday. The garment is really well made too, and very good value for the money. I love the shape it gives me. It makes my clothes look really great.",B000147990
"I bought this item with the reasonable faith that if not to slim me down two sizes, to at least make it look that way.  I wear it all day everyday and it makes my sweater dresses look better and gives me better posture.  wear it with other shapewear to contour your shape more.  Well worth it!",B000147990
IT FITS WELL AND SUPPORT GOOD. FOR ME IT IS JUST HARD TO PULL UP AT TIMES. I LOVE THE GIRDLE.,B000147990
"I have a tummy and this Girdle really pulls it in. My dresses fit great now. I' ve worn Rago for years their Old School and I wish more women would wear them , they would look so much better in their clothes.",B000147990
Spanx gets all the glory but this shaper is AMAZING. I was a perfect fit and is made very well. I have put my finger through two pairs of Spanx pulling them up. Im so happy I can even wear these with jeans. I wear skinny jeans and the legs of these don't get bunched up like Spanx or others Ive tried. The boning is perfectly placed and comfortable! The first time I wore it I didn't take the garter clips off and I was mili-seconds away from cutting them but I realized they are removable. Will order another pair asap. Love them,B000147990
"I got the mocha color in this shaper and love the color. I also liked the nice, smooth fit through the hips and thighs. But I bought it to slim my waist so I would look better in my holiday party dress, and that just did not happen. I wear a size 4-6 dress and a size 2 pants, but I'm petite and my waist is not small. I have a black waist cincher (same brand as this product - love it!), but wanted something in a neutral color to wear under a gold dress. Because I'm petite, the shaper came all the way up to my bra in front, and an inch or two lower in the back. But the waist portion was not tight and with the added boning, I think it actually made my waist bigger, not smaller. Too bad, because the color is perfect for me (I have light but lightly-tanned skin), and it did a good job of smoothing and slimming my hips and thighs. I would recommend going down a size or two if you really want this to cinch your waist.",B000147990
"I definately will buy another one because this shaper does me good. I will refer this to my friends,it is a must have",B000147990
This is the second one I've purchased. Fits good. Will purchase another color soon. Looks good and unnoticeable under clothing.,B000147990
"I measured my waist & went along with sizing suggestions. much to my dismay, it is way too small. I'm hoping that I will be able to break it in a bit, but having a back injury typically doesn't allow for experimentation. beautiful though!",B000147990
I love this shaper! I followed the size chart and it was right on. It's comfortable and really gives a nice look.,B000147990
"This is my second order, wore the first one for years and I love it.  It's beautiful wears great my first one still wearable with few worn spots due to my finger nails.  Great support and looks  sexy.",B000147990
"i love it
Rago High Waist Long Leg Shaper Girdle (6207) XL/Beige it have very good for human to protect from the wither",B000147990
"Let me preface this by saying that I never used to wear girdles. I had a classic black pencil skirt that I loved to wear, but the waist was slightly too tight for comfort to wear on a normal day, and I grew tired of the muffin top that resulted, even with a wide elastic belt over my waist. At one point, I bought a Rago 1294 open-bottom, high-waisted girdle in white, as my first girdle. I never got comfortable with it and only wore it once...it wasn't as tight as I felt it should have been, the zipper pull made an obvious bump under clothing, there was slight muffin-top above the girdle, and it came WAY too far down on my legs (I'm 5' 6"" and really long-waisted, so I'm still scratching my head how others wear the 1294 without the suspenders almost touching their knees. My legs aren't THAT short). So I consigned it and the pencil skirt to the closet.

Fast forward a few years. Fed up with the limitations of not being able to wear snug garments without the proper support (and with control top pantyhose constantly rolling over and making a crease on my tummy under dresses), I bought this girdle, the Rago 6207 in black. I also ordered the Rago longline bra to go with it in a 36B.

Simply put: I ADORE this girdle.

In the same size as the first girdle I purchased (34), it fits much, much better: snug everywhere it should be, but not so tight that I can't breathe or eat. It's one of the firmest levels of support Rago offers, and I quite like the feel. The lace cuffs are pretty and make a nice gentle transition from my thigh to the leg of the girdle. The patterned powernet material is attractive and actually rather sexy, especially in black. It smooths and firms up my lower torso and bottom very nicely, and with the long-line bra worn over it, there is no muffin top at all, and the two pieces actually nip in my waist a bit more than the girdle does alone.

What I love about the girdle:

- No muffin top with a longline bra over the top - the two are discreet under clothing, even under close fitting outfits.

- It encourages better posture, so I hold my shoulders back and my neck straighter.

- Detachable garters mean I can wear this without stockings if necessary, though I highly prefer stockings to pantyhose or bare legs.

- Way more sexy than Spanx could ever be, especially if you appreciate the vintage/retro aesthetic; I feel like a pinup model.

- Strong, constant control: the rigid lace panel in front doesn't so much suck in excess tummy as it does firm it up and make it a lot more smooth and shapely while remaining comfortable and flexible (if you want to flatten your stomach completely, you'll need to buy a corset).

- No zipper, thus the side seams are shaped identical to each other and smooth, not prone to buckling. (You have to ""roll"" it off at the end of the day, but it's quite easy once you learn how).

- I sometimes combine the girdle with Berkshire Full Support Stockings for additional support (I work in an office sitting at a computer all day; I have some spider veins on the back of my thighs that I want to keep from turning into varicose veins, and the compression does seem to help).

- Made in the US, and the construction is generally quite good. I've had to make a few very minor repairs to my oldest 6207s (broken stitches and the like), but they're still going strong.

There are a few negative points I've noticed, though:

- The silicone bands on the lace cuffs can be annoying and dig in to your skin slightly if you go bare-legged (the welt of a stocking puts a thin barrier between skin and the silicone, so it's not bothersome most of the time if you wear stockings). The silicone bands also start pulling apart and shedding little pieces with time and wear. The lace cuffs themselves can tear if you're a bit rough with them.

- The split crotch can be a bit annoying and bunch up when donning the girdle. I always just pull down my skirt/pull up my dress, flip the bottom of my bra up, roll the girdle down to use the restroom, and then reverse the process.  I'm considering just sewing the crotch up, as I don't use it.

- There are only two suspender clips on each leg, front and back, and they're small enough that they don't always hold reliably during normal wear. I replaced them all with wider elastic and larger suspender clips. I also sewed in an extra suspender on both sides, to give stronger, more distributed support for my stockings.

- The mocha version doesn't come with suspender clips at all; when that color was still being produced Rago removed all suspender clips from the 6207 girdle, but reinstated them after a year or so. I think they discontinued the mocha and beige colors around the same time, hence the remaining old-stock of mocha 6207s are without clips (though the beige 6207s regained them briefly, it seems). Because I can buy the elastic and clips easily and know how to sew them on, it's not a huge issue for me.

- The Rago longline bra only comes in black and white nowadays, so you're limited to black or white in the girdle if you want a matching set, unfortunately, unless you buy them white and have them dyed.

Keep in mind that I wear this style girdle almost every day, so mine get a lot more wear and tear than most people would give them as a special occasion piece of shapewear. I always machine wash them in warm water in a mesh lingerie bag on gentle, and hang them up in the bathroom to dry overnight.

Of this style I now have....two white, one black, and the mocha, with matching longline bras (three white, one black, and one I had dyed to compliment the mocha girdle), and I have no doubt I'll add another set when I can.

I dress like I stepped off the set of Mad Men almost every day, in classic, timeless dresses and skirts, and wearing a girdle underneath just makes the outfit look that much better and sophisticated. As of writing this, I'm 22 years old, and I'm perfectly happy to wear underwear that is now COMPLETELY foreign to my age group, because I feel amazing when I do.",B000147990
"I ordered a medium and I am size 6 and it was still extremely tight. I just can't wear it everyday it's just too uncomfortable, I will wear it for special occaisions but it really runs very small.",B000147990
"I normally wear a size 12-14 in jeans, but had to exchange the size large that I purchased for a 2XL.  It looks pretty and works great though. :)",B000147990
"I originally ordered one size, and it slipped on without any problem and offered some support, but I actually thought a size down may slim even more, so I ordered that.  I couldn't even pull the piece on, it was so tight!  Needless to say, I kept the larger one and returned the smaller - but I do wish that there were a size in between - I think that would be perfect!",B000147990
"I have been a longtime fan of body shapers. This Rago long leg shaper is THE best I have ever tried. I have used many of these in different brands, and let me tell you...NOTHING even comes close to the control power of this one. All of my clothes fit perfectly and look fabulous. I take out the metal stocking holders when I wear this under form fitting pants so there isn't the slight bulge. I ordered the small and it was HARD to get up over my hips, but after I got in up it stayed put. No rolling up of the legs or rolling down at the waist. It is A+. These take awhile to get used to, especially if you haven't ever worn a more firm old fashioned style girdle before. Nothing beats how is makes your body look in clothes. I will always buy this brand.",B000147990
"I had such high hopes for this garment. It's PRETTY, well constructed, relatively lightweight, came in higher sizes, and had decent firming and control for a time, but this garment is soooooo UNCOMFORTABLE! I found the material scratchy and hard, it also didn't really ""give"" or conform to my body. While the upper half did do a decent job of holding me in, the lower half was an  EPIC FAILURE!  The legs kept rolling up, and that made the whole thing constantly twist, UGGH! Needless to say I spent the day adjusting, and by the end of the day I was peeling myself out of this shaper in pain with red marks from all the twisting and adjusting. I made my purchase based on the reviews I'd read, I bought it in black, white, & beige. I wish people were more forthcoming and analytical in their reviews, it would have saved me a great deal of time and disappointment.  Maybe it's me but I returned the 2 I didn't wear and my search continues. So sad...",B000147990
"This product is worth every penny.  Please order your exact size.  THis girdle does not have much give and it is super supportive. If you try and order a size down thinking it will give you more support, your wrong.  You will end up having to return the item because you cant get your leg in it.  So, order the correct size to begin with, not a size smaller.",B000147990
"This seemed like an incredibly well made garment.  According to the size chart I should have ordered one size bigger than I did, that size wasn't available, so I ordered down. It didn't fit. Not too surprising! I sure tried to shimmy in to it though, because this looked like it would have been incredible!  I would highly recommend it, IF the size you need is available.",B000147990

"I ended up gaining a lot of stress weight just before my wedding, and needed to cinch in so i could lace my dress closed.
It is comfortable, and stays in place. Also very breathable.
I wore it the whole day.
I've worn it since when i needed a bit of extra help getting into dress pants.
Been through about 7 washes, and just got a small tear on the inside.
Also take note that the garter clips are removable.
Goes clear up to almost my bra in the front.
Was well worth the money.",B000147990
"I haven't worn one of these for a hundred years, but I was given a retro dress that I love, and it's very form fitting; so I bought this 'body shaper' and not only do I look great in the dress, but I'm comfortable also!  New and improved is all I can say.",B000147990
I was hoping to use these underneath my wedding dress but the pants were so tight. They push up any fat you might have so your stomach turns into a large donut. Disappointing and I ended up returning them.,B000147990
"I just tried on a small (on the advice that one should buy shapewear one size too small for optimal compression) and couldn't get it past my knees.  I just ordered a medium but I am thinking I may need a large.  I will update when it arrives.  FYI I am 5'9"" and wear a size 8/10 in clothing.  It looks just as pictured--very pretty.

I needed a shaper to wear underneath my mermaid style wedding dress. I've always used Spanx but this is by far the best shaper I have ever used. It holds and smooths everything in place. And the lace design adds a bit of sexiness. I would get the size you normally wear and not a size down.,B000147990
"This garment isn't a miracle maker--it won't reduce your waist by 2"" or create an hourglass shape where there isn't one. However for those of us carrying an extra 10lbs.--much of it in flabby bits around the middle--it solidifies the jiggly bits and creates nice clean lines for in and around low-waisted jeans and/or slim shirts.

As with most shaping garments I recommend ordering a size or two smaller than your measurements.

The garment through goes through a cold water wash and low temperature dryer with my other ""fine"" washables.

It *is* a boned garment and thus at the end of the day you'll notice that you're wearing it. Further the hooks for the garter belts straps tend to dig in a bit (once in the summer I actually got a blister). Of course if you never intend to wear stockings with it (or have stockings with good elastic/gripper) then just cut out the garter belt strap attachments.

I don't worry about the access panel as I wear underwear under and just fold/push the shaper down to use the toilet.

I do wear the long leg shaper with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rago-Shapewear-Long-Line-Support-Bra-Style-2202/dp/B0002L01X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rago Shapewear Long Line Support Bra Style 2202</a>. Not only do they create a great line but also is you have back problems they provide a moderate amount of support as well as keeping the muscles nice and warm.",B000147990
"This product seemed great but when I got it (which came in a timely manner) I found that it was not true to size, very uncomfortable and was not easy to get into.",B000147990
"This product arrived exactly as promised.  I had purchased one at a shop awhile ago, but had paid more.  I was happy with the price and the product.  The only thing with this shaper, as most, is that it does the job on hips and tummy but gives you a muffin top.  I wear it mostly with blouson dresses and tops.",B000147990
"While I am a big fan of vintage foundation garments this is my first long leg panty girdle. I typically prefer either an open bottom girdle or panty girdle which I wear with gartered stockings. However, I started looking for a girdle that would provide me with some thigh control as well as addressing my other problem areas. I was a bit skeptical at finding a long leg girdle that would fulfill my needs and still be comfortable and feminine. I am a fan of some of Rago's foundation garments and came across the Rago High Waist Long Leg Shaper Girdle and decided to give it a try based on it's feminine look and my luck with past Rago purchases.

It actually fit and looked better on me than I thought it would. I find that it does a great job of addressing my trouble spots and makes my clothes look better on me. It also helps in improving my posture and gives me a more feminine look. My job requires me to spend a lot of time sitting so comfort and posture control are very important. The lace is soft and doesn't bind and I also find the split crotch a very convenient feature. Another plus is that I can wear this girdle without worrying about the legs rolling up if I am not wearing stockings.

While the medium fits me well, it can be a bit challenging to get it on. I sometimes use some powder to help it slide up.

This girdle is definitely not going to be for all of you girls, but if you're looking for something that you can comfortably wear for long periods of time and that has strong midsection and thigh control as well as aid in improving your posture then you should consider giving this girdle a try.",B000147990
"I wear a Rago 6207 high waist long leg panty girdle - every day all day - it is wonderful! It does not
show - I do not have that ""girdled"" look and most of all it gives me a flat tummy. I do not wear panties
under, stockings, and only my girdle. The 6207 has no zipper and once it is on forget it. The open crotch
makes life easy in the bathroom. At first my girdle is tight, then it is comfortable and then I just forget
that I have it on. I am not at all self conscious and I look great - have had many compliments and no qustions
at all - women's girdles are not just for women. I have three 6207's - one on, one in wash and one in the drawer.
I would not leave home without my girdle - no ride up, roll over and a flat tummy.",B000147990
"Great girdle if you need a bit more support.
Has a crotch that can open when you have to go to the
Bathroom to tinkle. Luv it!!",B000147990
"Ive tried them all ladies, Spanx, Maidenform, all the generic ones, yummy tummy. This works the best to compress your flesh and take off inches. I wore them under my two wedding dresses that I wore on my big day, and I am so glad for these and I will never regret my decision. Recommend them highly!",B000147990
Worked great under my dress but a bit scratchy.  Worth it though as it did improve my figure!,B000147990
This garment is excellent for smoothing out your bumps and lumps.,B000147990
"This product sure makes your tummy flat, and your back side as well..... which I did not want to happen. I am 145lbs and ordered a large. It is a bit snug but I think the extra large would be too loose. So I will keep it for the days i need a really flat tummy!",B000147990
"When this arrived it looked really small and I panicked I ordered the wrong size Im 54 and 145bls with a larger hip/bootie area but even thought it took some effort to get on it was comfortable once on and this was even wearing it in the car an hour and half one way to the event. It came all the way up just under the bar and made
Such a difference in how the very tight dress fit. My only complaint is that is itchy in the lower leg area so I wore my thin bike shorts I wear under skirts in the summer and it both made it more comfortable and easier to get on and off.",B000147990
"I was really disappointed because I read good things about Rago from brides. It slimmed me down, but not even as much as my Spanx pantyhose do, which is what I had been wearing to my fittings. When I got the Rago in and wore it to my fitting, the dress barely zipped up. It squeezes my circulation at the thigh area, but I feel could be more fitted at the stomach part. Too thick or something, a little scratchy. Too bad I missed the return window. $40 down the drain.",B000147990
Way too small and felt rather scratchy.  I had to return.,B000147990
"This shapewear is very supportive and does not roll down at the waist. Great quality for the price, better than most.",B000147990
"I ordered the satin waist clincher, and received the lace one instead.  It does a good job of pulling the waist in to give an hourglass shape, but it doesn't do anything to help control the ""pouch"" I've gotten since giving birth.  Also, the garter belt attachments seem to roll up and look weird, and this garment is not invisible as it claims,  You can clearly see where the clasps fasten under shirts that are even the slightest bit form fitting. Another note, some reviews said this product runs small, but I didn't think so.  I ordered a medium and it fit well, although I needed to have my husband help fasten it at first.  After a few minutes of wearing I noticed it getting a bit looser.  I'll be returning this, and going with another brand.",B000147652
"I purchased this item to help cinch things up under a bridesmaid's dress. While it did do the job, by the time we got to the reception I was pretty uncomfortable. The boning in the cincher pokes you in the ribs if you wear it for much longer than an hour or 2.",B000147652
"I had a difficult time finding an xs waist cincher, but this is a great fit.  I just needed a little help fitting into my wedding dress and this did a perfect job!",B000147652
Fits and helps the front but then it pushes back fat over the top,B000147652
"This item does not cover me from the base of my bra to my hips, as is shown the photo.
This item is way too small for me.
I do not see an option to return this item.
Not enough size information provided by the seller to purchase this item online.",B000147652
"26.5"" waist and bought medium size. Fit like a glove and worked perfectly! Only complaint is that the garter straps kept popping off the cincher itself, but some wrangling and I finally got them to stick.",B000147652
Amazing! No more jelly belly with this! This was my first rago purchase. Have bought several more this past month and they are all fantastic!,B000147652
"I am giving it four stars because Rago continues to be excellent quality (I own a number of other Rago pieces) and because this did do exactly as promised. This piece runs smoothly from the bra band to the bum, so no bulges between bra and waist cincher which is excellent. It has removable garter straps, A+ in my book. And it has reinforced horizontal stitching to really nip in your waist without making things like breathing, eating or sitting down totally impossible. Unfortunately I return it because it just didn't work quite right for my shape. I am rather short waisted and I have a natural hourglass already, so my waist/hips have about 14"" difference between them. The combination meant that the back of the cincher didn't quite cover my bum the way their longer girdles do, nor could it be hitched up enough to rise above it the way their garter belts do, so it left me with a bit of a bisected bum.  I do think this is an awesome product, and had it been a little shorter in back it would have been a keeper for me.",B000147652
Got so many compliments on this when I wore it out. Really great and came as you would expect it. I've bought lingerie off Amazon before just to receive it and then gave a laughing fit cause it was so poorly made but this was not the case here. Great product.,B000147652
I wear a size 12-14 pant and I bought the 2XL which is perfect.  This is a very high quality item.  I washed once and it kept shape.  I think is very sexy when paired with a beautiful pair of stockings.  I got black.  Will definitely order again because of quality.  Thought the price was good.  It will hold up and last a very long time.,B000147652
"While I expected this to be a bit tighter, this is a very good quality product. It does the job giving me a nicer shape under a dress I am planning to wear for a special occasion. I suppose I could try returning it for one size smaller to see if that would make a difference, but I think it's good enough to stick with vs. the effort of returning. Again, a well-made product. I purchased it in black. I have not yet tried attaching stockings.",B000147652
"I was worried about visibility under my dress and there were no hints at all that I was wearing this on stage. Absolutely gorgeous piece, definitely going to be purchasing several!",B000147652
A remarkably comfortable and well designed garment.  The detachable garters are a blessing.,B000147652
"OMG. This gives me the shape I have always dreamed of having. I'm slim, but have a very straight, athletic torso. When I put this on, not only do I *feel* sexy (black and garters...), I have a well-defined waist! My vintage dresses and skirts look marvelous, and I could even size down in high-waisted skirts. This garment is the perfect length- it meets the bra line, and fully covers my torso as pictured (I'm 5'4). I love that the lower abs are held in while the waist is shaped. And yes, it IS comfortable. Ladies, no matter what your size, do yourselves a favor and buy this!",B000147652
"My waist is about 28"" and I bought a Small. I measured, and the cincher took about 1.5"" off my waist. It was snug and a little uncomfortable at first (it didn't hurt, I just felt very aware that I was wearing it) but after an hour or so I barely noticed it. It was really easy to put on myself thanks to the front clasps. My hips are a little wide, so I love that it fits smoothly around the top of the hips instead of just squeezing tightly at the bottom. The downside is that the clasps are visible under solid-covered fabrics, but since I'm planning on wearing it with a wedding gown with beading on the bodice it shouldn't be an issue for me. I could see a difference in my waist and felt more comfortable in some clothing I'd outgrown in the past few years, and had a much easier time zipping up some things I'd recently bought that had been a tight fit. I'm on the skinny side so the difference probably isn't noticeable to anyone except me in the photos, but since my midsection isn't as firm as it used to be, this was just what I needed.",B000147652
I was not sure about this purchase but it is a dream.,B000147652
If you have a short torso this may not work for you. The snaps down the center are visible underneath everything event though it does slim you down a bit. Its not as effective as a real corset but more of a bra for your stomach. Its not really all that sexy on me cause it keeps sliding up because of my wide hips. Buy it if you are not very curvy bust still have some lumps and don't mind wearing a slip.,B000147652
"This waist cincher does what it's supposed to do without being uncomfortable. Very nice materials and looks really good when wearing.
It stays in place for the 3 hours I've been wearing it so far. Top does curl sometimes a little but not much at all.
I'm very satified with this waist cincher, size is perfect.",B000147652
"For as much as it hurt to spend $40 on this shapewear, for the first time, The garter straps were *actually* supportive!! It was very comfortable during a wedding and I didn't have to keep messing with the garter hooks to make sure they were secured",B000147652
"Great  product.
However, does anyone have a problem with the garters breaking apart after wearing the waist cincher just a few times?  I'm frustrated about this, because finding and replacing these garter straps with clips is a pain!!",B000147652
I'm so glad to have this company around! its hard to find my size that fits just right!!!!!!!!!! trying to get into not just looking vintage on the outside but the under part is crucial...hehehehe ;),B000147652
Rago's underbust corsets are my go-to shapewear/sexy-wear. Definitely made my wedding night sexier!,B000147652
"My favorite thing ever! I've owned three of these- I maintain stiletto nails and over time I end up poking holes in various articles of clothing but I refuse to try anything else. Accentuates my figure, I can wear it all day and be comfortable. The hook and eye closure is only really visible under certain articles of clothing  so I try and avoid thinner skin tight t-shirt like fabrics.",B000147652
I suggest buying smaller than you expect.  We did and the sizing is great!  Rago has a sizing chart on their website.,B000147652
This is definitely NOT a woman's size medium. I am a size 2 and this thing does not even come close to fitting. Terrible,B000147652
"This waist cincher is awsome! I already own a ""ann cherry"" waist cincher, which I always felt was too short for me and wasn't breathable. I also have a few steel bone corsets and have been tight lacing for the last couple of years which I love because the give me my perfect hourglass shape. The only downside to them are they're not flexible and can be hard to hid under clothing. This is where this beauty comes in!! I'm so impressed that I'm going to buy more! It gives me an hourglass shape (which my ann cherry one didnt) and is so breathable and comfortable!  Also, it's high enough in the back and low enough in the front. It's really made well and the material is so soft. If you buy it you won't regret it. As far as sizing goes, I didn't really follow the chart. I knew I wanted an extreme hold so I purchased one at the size of my steel boned corset that I can fully close now. If you want a more relaxed fit, I think the size chart is accurate.",B000147652
"Great beginner cincher or for wearing under your dress on date night to surprise the hubby :)  Love that it is wide enough to not give you the dreaded muffin top or back fat rolls! Only negative is that if you doesn't order the right size it isn't adjustable at all since only one row of hooks, but for the low price it was great as an extra addition to our date nights.....",B000147652
It didn't fit correctly and rolled up when I would walk.,B000147652
Great fit that has breathable material!  Tgat why I keep buying it,B000147652
Way smaller than expected. Unfortunate.,B000147652
I bought an XL glad I did. My waist size is 32 but after checking out the reviews I went a size up. Was able to wear this under my wedding dress comfortably.,B000147652
This is the best waist cincher I've ever bought! It's flexible and surprisingly comfortable. Great for giving you a clean line under shirts and dresses.,B000147652
"Great product feel, but was way too small. I think the sizing chart needs to be more explicit vis-a-vis measurements.",B000147652
"I bought this waist cincher for under my wedding dress. I really love the look of this when it's on; I am a size 2 so I bought this more to define my waist than to ""lose inches"" and it's great for that. It is very sturdily constructed and pretty.

My only complaint is that because it has a hook and eye close along the front, it is pretty visible when worn under anything tight or a material that is clingy.",B000147652
"Im giving this product 2 stars for one reason; one of the suspenders broke from the cincher the very first time I used it.
The cincher was snug but fit well and was comfortable. The suspenders appeared to be very heavy duty with excellent clasps which is difficult to find.
Now I will need to have the suspender repaired before I can wear it for the first time.
Everything else about the product seems to be high quality.",B000147652
"I have about 40inch hips and the XXL worked out great, after reading review yes this thing does run very very small I'm just a medium/large type and I had to get XXL to fit right. It was money well spent though it feels very high quality.",B000147652
"It does exactly what I wanted without undue bulges, it's not too hard to put on with the hooks, and the garters are removable. It's comfortable enough that I can wear it all day. I ordered 3 inches under my waist measurement and it fits just perfectly. Love it!",B000147652
I love it smooth and breathable I got the large am 5'3 weigh about 172 pounds with a 42 inch waist it was snug but nice im getting an xl in black for a comfier fit,B000147652
"LOVE this waist cincher.  Only surprise for me was that there is only one column of hooks.  Not a problem, as the garment fit AND does it's job.  Unfortunately, the second time I wore it with its garters, one of them fell apart - tore actually.  Very disappointed.",B000147652
"I have a 32 inch waste but since my hips are 10 inches larger than my waste, I sized up, like it says to do on the manufacturers site.  Unfortunately this is too big and will have to be returned.  It looks good and could probably pass, it just doesn't do what I want it to and will be way to big if I lose any weight.",B000147652
I was really excited to try this cinched out for a wedding. I am not overweight but do not have a flat tummy either. I had this gorgeous fitted dress for a wedding i was part off so i wanted to look by best. It did make everything tighter and smoother but the dress was so fitted that you can see i was wearing a cincher. I ended up not wearing it. I do like how it cinches everything but it is hard to wear it with fitter clothes because you can see it and there isn't a point of wearing shapewear if you were loose clothes.,B000147652
Very nice material. Fits and looks great!!,B000147652
It was great exactly what was described ando fit how the size chart said.,B000147652
"Spanx has nothing on Rago. This makes me look so shapely! Unfortunately my crazy large eastern european ribcage gets pretty bruised after using this thing, but that's not surprising. Love this. I detatch the straps.",B000147652
"This item helps one stay on the ""diet"" :) and supports the back.  Very confortable. I will buy again.",B000147652
I bought this for my wedding to flatten my stomach which is did but I couldn't  use it because my dress had to low of a back,B000147652
It works as it should- though I should have bought a size smaller.  I bought it to wear under my body con dresses for giving me more of a hourglass figure-- but you can see the bottom edge all the way around unless I wear a looser dress.  And the first time I put it on one of the garter belt straps came off.  I can fix that with a needle and thread-- but I was bummed because I wanted it to do what it should and look good . If you get the right size it does the job and it's not uncomfortable- in fact it feels good.  Just wish I had ordered a size smaller and that it didn't show under my tighter dresses.,B000147652
"I have a 28"" waist and after reading reviews, I bought this in size S (small). It works like a dream and for what it is, it's pretty comfortable. I measured my waist while wearing this, and I'd say it takes a good 1.5-2"" off.",B000147652
"I have a body shaped politely described as ""doughy brick."" My waist line varies between ""nonexistant"" and ""a dip between skin rolls.""
I bought this cincher to wear under a holiday dress with the intent of smoothing my jiggly belly. BUT YOU GUYS, IT GAVE ME A WAIST TOO!
It has a sneaky amount of stretch and, as a result, is surprisingly comfortable. Plus, unlike the thigh-to-boobs shapers I was considering, I won't have to wrestle undergarments when holiday cocktails leave me wobbly and in dire need of a bathroom. Whee!",B000147652
"Very nice, it fits my 30"" waist and slight hips fine. It gives a nice shape from hips waist and just below the bust. I found it comfortable to wear as I normally sit up  straight. It appears good quality.",B000147652
"It's beautiful and much better quality than I expected!! I measured my waist before purchasing it. I have a 30 inch waist, so I bought the large. It fits perfectly! Now, it definitely flattens your stomach, but it makes your hips/sides significantly more curvy! I will have to get used to seeing that, but it looks nice.",B000147652
"nice construction, but too tight at the hips and too loose at the waist. i have a 27 inch waist and 40 inch hips, not curvy enough for me.",B000147652
Product came in defective. The hook was ripped out of place. Pretty disappointed. I recommend purchasing elsewhere.,B000147652
"I was very VERY careful about which garter/corset to buy for a special gown I wanted to wear, and boy am I glad I got this one. There's wiring in the back, which shows through on tight shirts and dresses, but it is just downright lovely to my hourglass figure. I made sure to check out comments and reviews on this product and it goes right in line with what everyone else has said:

This thing is amazing. If I wear it too long while slouching (for me that's about 3 hours) I do find that it hurts my mid-rib cage, but that isn't exactly the product's fault... I just need to sit like a lady and it doesn't hurt.",B000147652
Really love it. Fits great and makes me look awesome. I'm going to get another one in a smaller size.,B000147652
"Bought the X-Large (32), it fits great. My waist measures right around 32"" so it seems pretty true to size. Good quality, as expected from Rago.",B000147652
"Got a 2X-Large (34)... I'm 5'5/180 lbs with a curvy hourglass shape.

Wow, pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be too small as I really have to pull the sides together to fasten it, but once it's secure, it's quite comfortable for a cincher. It has enough give to move around in unlike some classic corsets, but still keeps your waist curvy and tummy flat and sexy. Once it's on, you can pull it up or down a little to adjust, but it covers my tummy perfectly. Not great for slouching, but I feel like I could wear it out without being too uncomfy all night.

Looks phenomenal with fishnets, but remember to clip them on before the cincher is on you (it'll be a lot easier).",B000147652
Love it!!! Made me look amazing!,B000147652
"I'm 5'9"" and weigh 150, I'm a size 6 in dresses and 7 in pants.  I ordered a size small and somehow was able to get it hooked!  I thought the girdle was extremely comfortable, but  it does create a little back fat at the top, even though I don't have back fat :(  the garter belts are removable and it only rolled up a little, like one fold, when I didn't have stockings on.",B000147652
to large and had to send back. But it was made well,B000147652
"exactly like photos. it really accentuates the waist, and my torso is very narrow. Kind of squishes the upper part of your behind and looks a little funny",B000147652
This my first one of these type shaper's and I'm very pleased with the fit and the look! The material is top notch and the garters are all metal which is why I chose this one. I will be buying more,B000147652
I probably bought a size smaller than I should have. This product is very good!,B000147652
"Seems to be made well, but even ordering a size larger it was way too small. I can get it on, but it causes ugly back rolls. I would have needed 2 sizes bigger at least. I don't want to go through the trouble or exchanging so hopefully I will lose some weight or find a friend small enough for it.. but very disappointing. I really read other reviews and paid attention to sizing and it was still pretty much a shot in the dark guess to determine the right size to buy.",B000147652
"Very nice and good quality.  A little snug, so it's hard to get on.  But that's kind of the point!",B000147652
Very sexy. I love the retro look of this garment. It works wonderfully with my stockings.,B000147652
"Thought it wouldn't fit at first (I'm 5'2'' about 128 lbs with mommy pooch from having a baby 4 months ago with wide-ish hips and I ordered the Medium) but like I saw another woman said, you suck in as much as you can, get it all fastened and it fits like a dream. Totally comfortable and makes me feel really good like a nice hug and flattens my tummy and smoothes my love handles. It does fold just slightly on the ends but it isn't bothersome and the fastener line is very visible through tight clothing, but if you had some body to fasten it up your back it doesn't matter. I fasten it up the front though because I don't care if it shows I think its sexy",B000147652
So excited! I just got it in the mail today(which was right on time. 2days withy prime) I am 5'4 145 lbs. I usually wear between an 8-10 in pants and I ordered the large (30). It fit great! I was worried because I have ordered other waist clinchers and have been disappointed because they would fit on top and be way to small on bottom or fit on the bottom and be way to big up top (I've had two kids and just want some smoothing when I wear dresses and stuff) but this one is great because it is so stretchy! The garters are a plus: super cute and they seem durable although I haven't washed it yet or anything. They come off easy too.,B000147652
Sexy and functional. Runs a little big but that's fine by me! Can wear it all day without discomfort.,B000147652
"If you have a little muffin top, the thin band at the top rolls out and the front closure is noticiable with tops that are not loose fitting.",B000147652
"My boyfriend suggested I order one of these due to my having constant stomach pain with no medical cause found yet. For the first time in 6 years my abdoman is nearly pain free! It is extremely firm and has no pokey bits, even when sitting or leaning down. I will be ordering several more.",B000147652
"I just received my cincher less than an hour ago and I'm already in love with it! I was skeptical about the quality when purchasing because of the price but it really is such a great product.  I'd recommend it to any, new to waist cinchers or experienced.",B000147652
This is the second one I have purchased. I love everything about this cincher. <3,B000147652
Love this thing I model and shot with this more then once very happy!,B000147652
"I was advised to get a size larger when I sent a question in. My measurements are 32 waist and 41 hips, I got an extra large and it was snug in a good way. Seems to cinch everything in nice. I haven't wore it very long, but will review after wearing for a full day.",B000147652
Excellent quality gave to younger sister,B000147652
"I measure a 32"" waist, and 38"" hips. I ordered a medium, which was a perfect fit around my hips, but tight around my waist. I'd still order the same size, because I was able to 'squish' my waist into the cincher (hey, it's a CINCHER!) with only a little bit of work AND it didn't bite into my hips and butt. The hooks seem strong. The entire cincher did stretch out a little bit to accommodate my wide waist, which made closing it up the second time around a bit easier.",B000147652
"The picture shows it comes up right under the bust, which is what I wanted,  but on me it only comes up slightly over my belly button. It tightens and does everything it should, its just not long enough to cover my torso",B000147652
"I bought this to wear under a costume to give myself that nice shape/curve.
When I relax my belly, my waist measures about 28in(which would be a medium), and when I suck it in, i get to about 26(small). My chest/bust and hp measurements hover just about S and XS give or take. Now the XS waist measure says 25in, which I could barely not suck my belly into, however, I still went with XS cuz I wanted to really pull my mid section in.

Wow, did this pull my mid section in! After i put this on, my belly was just about flat from a side view. However, as expected this was veeeeery tight on me, and I'm not sure I would be able to wear this for an extended period of time. Like other reviewers said, the bottom kind of rolls up a bit if you don't use the garter belts, and the front hooks aren't completely flat, so if you're wearing something extremely tight, they might show through. Also, since this sits so tight, on me, the lil extra fat at the top kinda hangs out, so that will show as well if you're wearing anything super tight. The bottom part blended seamlessly to my hips, and there wasn't a weird ""extra fat"" part hanging out at the bottom. I wish, however, that this also had more pulling action extending down on the love handles.
Unlike what other reviewers said though, I never experienced the boning poking into me, even though this sat so incredibly tight on me. I have a slightly short torso I think, so maybe that could be it?

I wore this under a costume that isn't really tight, nor is it loose; it kinda just sits exactly on the body. So my costume wasn't tight enough to hold anything in, but not loose enough to hide any ""flabby"" or unflattering bits. This corset worked perfect for my costume, but I imagine that if you're actually wearing anything super tight on top, and you do not have a very low body fat percentage, this corset will not blend seamlessly into your silhouette.

PROS:

- Shapes incredibly well!! can potentially take off 3in from your waist

- decently comfortable

- very sturdy

CONS

- bottom rolls up w/o garter belts

- does not blend seamlessly (fat rolls at the top where the corset ends)

- front closure is not completely flat

All in all, do not expect some miracle product that feels like you're wearing nothing yet takes inches off your waist! The sturdier a shareware is, the better it will hold you in, the more it holds you in, the more discomfortable you'll be. This product does what is supposed to do very well, and for how well it holds you in, it is not as discomfortable as you'd think something like that would be.",B000147652
"Im 212 pounds 5, 3 I usually fit in size 2x.
3x shapewear ends up being a bit large.
However with Rago, the 3x wasn't large enough to even clip one of the clasps.. If you have a round  belly, pear shaped body, I would advise to buy 2 sizes larger than what  you usually wear.",B000147652
Wore underneath my wedding dress. For all other dresses it's far too bulky and lumpy. Even with a slip,B000147652
"I'm a size 0 with narrow hips & have tried many different brands that didn't do anything for the waist but this actually cinches my waist & looks great under my wedding dress! I gave it 4 & not 5 stars because I wished it'd flatten & hold the belly in more. Plus, it only has one row so u can't tighten more. But overall, pleased it's small enough to fit!",B000147652
"HOLY SMOKES
This thing is perfect in every way....... My natural waist is about a 27 so I ordered the small/26..... I needed it to go under my custom made gown because I have a mommy pouch that just will not quit even though I'm thinner now then I was before baby..... But I digress.... I really want to order it in black for everyday wear because it hugs me so effectively but is not uncomfortable at all!!!

Cant wait to wear this on my wedding day!",B000147652
"I went by pants size in the sizing chart and this size was way to small. Maybe if I had a flat stomach it would have fit however I dont, which is why I need the product. Material is great just too small. I returned for a bigger size. Havent received yet. I will add another review afterwards.",B000147652
Order at least a size bigger then what you think you are.,B000147652
"Fit and material is very well, the issues are the garters are very utilitarian and need to be swapped for something a little more elegant to match.",B000147652
"Sucks in tummy well. Note: if you have a short tourso, it may be a little long. The length was the reason for 4 stars. Great quality. Ordered an size XS and I am a size 2.......with a tummy at times:(",B000147652
"Bought this for my girlfriend and she said ""It has a good fit, it's comfortable and holds everything it is supposed to.""  Additionally, it looks great on her!",B000147652
i like the item but ordering was a little confusing - i thought i was ordering 1X but it was actuallyXL. Could send back but should be able to fit it in about 2 months. Quality item - should have contacted company to clarify ordering sizes.,B000147652
rago shapewear is my number 1 go-to for confidence booster!,B000147652
"Love this product!! I purchased it to wear under a bridesmaid dress, and the way it defined my waist and helped flatten my stomach, I LOVED it! highly recommend this!",B000147652
Love! Holds me in great. Length is perfect. Material is nice. Easy to put on. Boyfriend loved it,B000147652
"Size stated was WAY wrong, like maybe 4 sizes wrong.",B000147652
"Love it.  It's very very tight. I got an XS as I'm a 24"" waist, might want to go up a size if your weight fluctuates.  It's very stretchy so it does have room for give.",B000147652
After reading others reviews I expected the size to run small so I ordered a lil bigger than I actually I wear.,B000147652
"I'm a big girl, but this help cinch me the way I needed it to!",B000147652
This is amazing and really shapes you. I love it so much better than my spanx even though my spanx are more comfortable for every day wear,B000147652
Im giving this product a 3 stars I think its made to thick and large and would become to tight to large to wear under clothes.,B000147652
"I have a 28"" waist and ordered the medium. It fit perfectly. I wear it under my dresses to work and can sit comfortably in this cincher for 10 hours. I definitely recommend wearing a camisole underneath to avoid digging or chafing. I have worn it with and without the garter straps (I often wear thigh highs instead of full pantyhose). I found it the garters to be slightly uncomfortable after extended wear--the hook in the rear kept digging into me, but overall I'm extremely satisfied with this cincher. It creates a very sexy, slimming silhouette and is undetectable under clothes. Plus it's very inexpensive!",B000147652
"I wear this every single day and it's perfect. It makes my figure look more like an hourglass figure, and it keeps my stockings in place all day. One of the garter straps did come loose after a number of months of daily use, but that was easily fixed.

edit: After wearing the white one every day for about 8 months, I've just purchased another in black. Love it!",B000147652
"I love corsets and waist cinchers. This is by far one of my favorites. I'm 5'3"" and between 130 - 140, I wear a 38C and have hips, booty and shapely thighs. I ordered a medium/28 and it fits very well and looked great. The straps are really well made and are detachable, they hold on to my thigh highs very well. I have a short torso so this came up to the bottom of my bra and is slightly over my bottom making my bum pooch out a bit, no complaints. The boning doesn't bend so it makes me sit up straighter, also no complaints. It's comfortable enough to wear all day with the boning only taking shape slightly from sitting. It's really very sexy. My fella loves this for playtime and under my dresses.",B000147652
"A beautiful cincher but runs extremely small. I ordered a size 28 because that's what my waist size is normally and both me and my husband were struggling to get me in it. But because I loved the material, and the width of the garter straps, I took a chance and ordered a size bigger and it fits perfectly! Just make sure to order a size bigger!",B000147652
"I have a couple waist cinchers ,after having twins I need one,and this one is good. I wish it had a little more stretch. I find also if you choose not to use the garders then it fits a little funny on the hips. I had planned to wear this primarily with out using the garders but now I will only be able to wear with because it creates an indent on my hips. It looks very nice and is a good length, I am 5'7"" and sometimes the cinchers are made for people with either a short waist or shorter stature. For help with sizing I ordered a M weight 160lbs with a 32G bust so a good amount of my weight is in my bust.the medium fits exactly as it should , snug but comfortable.",B000147652
"It certainly pulls you in tightly. I wish this had a smaller torso option, because as much as I feel the constriction, the cincher bunches up underneath my breast area, making it uncomfortable.",B000147652
"Fits just right without buckling, and I can still bend and twist comfortably.",B000147652
"I had to return this because their idea of sizing and my idea of sizing do not fit together. Ridiculously small -- at least 4 inches too small! The quality looked nice, but what good does that do me if I can't fit it even after loosening it to the max.",B000147652
"so yes it was tightish once on, but duh its a corset but once I got it on it did its job plus the garters held up my thigh highs good!",B000147652
"Based on what I read, I chose mine 4 inches less than my true size. So I'm an M but I bought an S.

I went to search this product after watching a youtube video explaining the different types of underwear for vintage clothing. Just like the lady said:

- Even with a slim-fit dress, you won't notice the cincher. The only thing you'll notice is YOUR BEAUTIFUL BODY SHAPE!
- It is VERY COMFORTABLE!
- The material is thick and strong.
- It helps a lot with your posture.
- You will look and FEEL fantastic.
- Talk about sexy? YES!
- It is definitely a really good option for ladies who dress vintage clothing: Add a bullet bra and socks = ready to kill!

 I am beyong happy with this product<3",B000147652
"Wonderful. I love this, planning to buy more soon. It rolls up a little bit from the bottom, but it's not a huge problem. Makes a beautiful figure!",B000147652
"The size chart for this doesn't match up with its actual size. My measurements are in the size L range, but after reading some reviews on it running small I decided to get XL. The XL is still extremely small, it'd need to be like a good 4 inches bigger to be closed IF I sucked in as much as possible.  I understand it's a corset but that doesn't mean you throw sizes out the window... If you are chubby like me make sure you order at least 2 sizes more than your measurements match up with on their size chart.",B000147652
"I couldn't be more pleased with this product. I ordered a Small/26, and it fits like a dream!",B000147652
Absolutely love it! It fit perfectly! Looked great beneath my clothes and without any as well ;),B000147652
"I just love it! I'm a TV, and I REALLY needed a new girdle! It holds me in all the right places and I love the way it feels. I wear it every day, and I find it very comfortable. And as an added bonus, my boyfriend loves the garters!",B000147652
"I am 5'5"" with a 33"" waist. The size I got works very well for me. I could have sworn I bought a large but I believe I changed my mind and got a medium last minute because I was worried the large would be loose and I am continuing to lose weight, did not want to buy another in 4 months. the medium is 28"". I didn't think it would fit when I first tried it on but like any bra it was snug at first and stretches out a little after breaking it in. I wear it often and it fits like a glove now. My friend noticed the curves immediately. The straps for your thigh highs are fantastic. Nice thick durable and stretchy straps attach to the thigh highs very well. Looks awesome with dresses, as my bust line is 42"". I like the top of it to blend with the bottom of my bra (no 2-3"" of skin showing inbetween) so that it appears to be a corset. But I have found that if it is up too high the shape enhancing material may constrict the lower ribs which I have seen can cause internal issues and over time reshape your rib cage and internal organs if it is tight enough. But that takes years of wearing it every day:) Don't end up with a 16"" waist!",B000147652
"I am 5'0 and 125 pounds, and the medium size fit perfect. I love it!",B000147652
"I love this cincher! More comfortable then a corset but still holds me in on my problem areas. Got this to wear with my wedding dress, but I've been wearing it to work too. Love it!",B000147652
"This one give you the eight hour glass figure, cover everything, but if you are to sense to tight and can't support well, spanx exist, but this one is perfect , I combine spanx and this one at the same time, so when I wear tight dress I wear both together to not show the hooks from Rago",B000147652
"The Rago 21 is quickly becoming my go-to garment for under vintage and vintage-style clothing. It's firm enough to hold everything in place, long enough that you can line it up with your bra in the back and keep everything looking smooth, and short enough that using the ladies' doesn't become a big production like it can with an open bottom girdle. Unless you're wearing mainly pencil skirts or wiggle dresses and need the hip smoothing of an OBG or a long-line panty girdle, go for the Rago 21. The only small quibble is that there are only four garter straps, when six would really work better, but hey, nothing's perfect.",B000147652
"This made my waist easily an inch or two smaller. It is lightweight and breathable, but very firm control.

It can leave a bit of a line under your clothing if it's too large or if the clothing is too thin...",B000147652
"This is a good cincher if you are wearing a swing skirt or dress. I have a longer torso so it didn't quite smooth out my lower tummy, but in the case of wearing it with a swing skirt, it created a beautiful waist and looked really good.",B000147652
Gorgeous for the price. Will buy again in white.,B000147652
Can I buy stock in this company? You have made me a very happy woman!,B000147652
"FIT: I have a 27.5"" waist. I've gained about fifteen pounds over the last year, growing out of several dresses and skirts with a 25""/26"" waist. I bought the XS based on reviews, but I really think I should have gone with the S. The XS does reduce my waist to its old dimensions, but it is so tight that it buckles and gaps a little at the front closure.

QUALITY: The shaper itself is very well made and good quality, BUT the loops for attaching the garters, and the garters themselves, were developing loose threads and wear right out of the box. The boning has developed a little bend that pokes me in my right side, but I suspect that is because my posture has never been straight and the shaper is simply adapting.

PERFORMANCE: I've worn this five or six times already, and it does very well. It can become a little uncomfortable, but as I said I think it's a little small. I also broke it in with three 12-hour days at a convention - not smart. Does it roll? Yes, but only when the garters are unattached. They are at least good strong garters and I've only had a few problems with them coming unhooked at the top during wear. (The clasps are standard and I've attached them to sheer stockings, costume fishnets, and thick socks without a problem.) Of course it gives you a lovely, straight figure and makes you look very put together. As a side effect, I find that my stomach is so squished that I don't get very hungry while I'm wearing it, and certainly can't eat much. On the other hand, it constricts the bladder too, so prepare for bathroom breaks.

OVERALL: I'm glad I own this, and I'm going to continue wearing it on a regular basis until I feel the need to get a new one. However, I will definitely be upgrading instead of replacing. It was a great first shaper at a not-terrible price, and now I know exactly what I'm looking for.",B000147652
"Bought this years ago and it still fits great after many wears and many washings. It cinches you in very tight. After maybe a dozen wearings it will loosen up a bit. Very durable elastic, however. Has not lost its shape. If it is not the right size, it will roll down, the boning is quite flexible.",B000147652
Bought this for the wife. Gives you that great hourglass figure. The only issue was the bottom back of the item is a little bumpy and if you're wearing a really tight outfit you can barely make it out. Other than that she loves it.,B000147652
"I am 5'1"" and around 100 lbs and this fit me perfectly. My hips are not as curvy as I'd like them to be so I was super excited to see the shape this gave me. This enhanced my 24"" waist which gave me a bit of an hourglass look. I would recommend the x-small for ladies sizes 00-2.

It was not too constricting and looked fine under several of my dresses. Don't be alarmed about how tiny it looks before you put it on. Should be unnoticeable under clothing without the clips as long as the fabric is not too thin or tight.",B000147652
"I have bought two of these Rago Women's waist cinchers and have been pleased with my purchase both times. They are sturdily made and have held up over time. The first one that I bought is now four years old and still is in good shape. They are also a firmer control than many other products that I have tried over the years, which I like and was looking for.

On the fit:

I am 5'9"". Four years ago, I weighed 215ish lb. I bought the 3X/36, and it fit well. It didn't roll (which is a sign that it is too small) but it also provided a firm compression.
I have in the past year or so lost a lot of weight. I now weigh 170 lb. I was still wearing the 3X waist cincher, but mostly just for the smoothing affect as I had shrunk too much to get much compression from it. So since I liked the first one, I purchased another, this time in size XL/32. It also fits relatively well, but I think this is the smallest size I could possibly get at my current weight and still be able to get it on--it is a TIGHT compression. That said, in another couple of months I should drop another 5 lb or so and it will fit perfectly.

I've never had any problems with mushrooming out of these cinchers, but I suspect that is more a matter of finding the right fit and the tendencies of one's own body than anything to do with the waist cinchers themselves. But it also helps that it gets slightly looser at the top and bottom.

The first one I got was black and the second is white. I definitely liked the black better as it was less see-through. I also suspect that over time the black holds up better to stains/discoloration. But as it is worn under the clothes, it really makes no difference.

By the way, don't unclasp the front as it is near impossible to put on that way. Simply pull/roll it on and off over your head.

The only problem that I've occasionally had with these is that the front clasps are somewhat visible through some of my clothes as they are a slightly raised ridge. However, I've never had anyone comment on it, and frankly, I'd be surprised if anyone but me even noticed. Given that everyone pulls it on without unclasping it, I'm not sure why these clasps exist at all. It would be better if it were just a smooth front panel.",B000147652
"Fits as expected and easy to put on and off, would buy from this seller again.",B000147652
"I've tried just about every waist cincher on the market, and this one is the BEST, hands down.  The fabric is airy (unlike those awful latex ones that make you sweat) so you get air to your skin; it wears well and holds up longer than most; it is firm, yet not uncomfortable and it is sexy, especially when worn with stockings.  Highly recommend!",B000147652

You can't see it underneath clothes and slims you quite nicely . I bought a large and seeing as I'm not considered a large , it fit snug ( as it's supposed to)  It's also comfortable !",B000147652
"I usually wear a small for most things, but I had to return this for a large. I like the large",B000147652
This is really useful for my form fitting dresses.  It eliminates being able to see where my underwear waist band is.  The only downside to this is the front clasps can be identified under dresses that identify every curve.  I have a waist of 28.5in and the medium fit me perfect.,B000147652
I wear a size 15 pant and 36 in bras and the XXL fits very well. It's tight but it gives me the hourglass figure I wanted and it sucks up my tummy wonderfully. I love the way it covers my whole torso and looks super sexy! 8),B000147652
"I usually wear a large in most things. I bought this, and I could get it on. Once I was wearing it, I had the hugest muffin top on planet Earth. I wound up returning it.",B000147652
"This is not meant to be a hard-core waist trainer, but if you are looking for something to smooth out lumps and bumps and give you a sleeker look this works great. Due to the nature of this cincher, you probably will get some lumps between your bra and the top of the garment and perhaps underneath, there really is not way around that unless you wear a full body cincher and that's just silly. Since it is not connected to anything it may ride up a little if you sit, but nothing that's too bothersome. I actually wear this because I have a medical appliance that sticks out and when I wear this it looks like I don't have it. So 5 stars for that! It looks very sexy too and I am a fan of vintage-style thigh highs so the detachable garter straps are a bonus.",B000147652
"I bought this awhile back and only wore it twice simply because it did not cinch my waist at all. In fact, it fitted just like a normal slim-fit top would. I was rather disappointed. The material is quite comfortable but if you are looking for something that's sturdy and really effective for making the waist smaller, I recommend you try other brands.",B000147652
"I wear this with almost ever dress I wear with the garters!!!
I wear a lot of 50s inspired dresses. I love my waist cinched in and it gives me that beautiful sexy figure!
Plus the fabric allows you to BREATHE! My other one is non breathable material and dancing in it blows! But this one is a dream!
Yes in the front it will show through fitted dresses but that doesn't bother me!
I bought the smallest on here. I wish there was a smaller one than that.
This is a very comfortable cincher! And this is coming from someone who dances and twirls for four hours a night!",B000147652

"I have learned long ago, a husband does not comment on the Mrs. extra occasional pounds, not if he prefers less conflict in the home life.  Or unless he really likes sleeping on the couch...
With that qualification, my wife purchased this to ""smooth the bulges"".  According to her - 'It's not uncomfortable to wear for hours at a time, even to eat.""  The garters are detachable (dang!) so that makes it basically a shaping garment.  My wife is 5'4, and currently (I know this because she is on a diet at the moment to lose some weight from a surgery and recovery) and weighs 165.  The 2x/34 fit her, although she felt she could go down a size.

You get the firms hold from the front but not the sides.. If you have love handles it will not be smoothed out with this gurdle. Your sides will buldge out....... Disappointed,B000147652
This cincher did smooth out my waist but it didn't cinch in as much as I had hoped for. I've see some reviews saying the bottom of the cincer rolls up if you don't use the garters...mine was opposite...the bottom was fine but the top of the cincher rolled down...this is most likely because I am short with a short torso (5'2'')...the cincher seems to be made for taller women. Sadly this will be returned.,B000147652

"This fits well, holds in the tummy, and actually wearing it, had made my waist smaller.",B000147652
I was really happy with this cincher.  It is very comfortable and breaths well in moderate temperatures. I have had it a month or so and washed it every week and let it air dry. It has kept its shape. I found that the size guide was accurate.  I also double checked size guides in other retailers just to double check.,B000147652
"I got the small (I'm 36/26-27/36). I hoped it would pull my waist in an inch, or at least provide some contouring. Unfortunately, the difference is pretty negligible. I wonder if the x-small would have been a better choice.

It does smoothe BUT you can see the closure in the front and the boning if you wear it underneath anything form-fitting, which is exactly what I got it for. I've worn it once under something loose and it wasn't horrible. It rode up but that could be because I wore it without the suspenders.

If you're looking for something to shape, there's probably something better out there. The only real benefit for me was being reminded to sit up straighter.",B000147652
"Pro's - Fits as expected on 5'5' 100lb frame. Good quality. looks sexy. Provides good slimming and comfortable.
Con's - Found it for a few dollars less elsewhere. Front latches can be seen through tight tops.",B000147652
"First of all, I just wanted to say that I had been in the market for something along this line for a while. I am 5 feet 1.5 inches tall (I am partial to that 1/2 inch) and my measurements, without the girdle, are 32I - BUST, 32"" - WAIST, and 44"" - HIPS and I weigh about 150 pounds (no, it won't change your weight on the scale). I opted for a size MEDIUM/28 because I plan on losing weight after I have an ovarian cyst removed (that thing caused me to gain about 25 pounds over the past 2 years, without me changing my diet) I was very surprised at how quickly that garment arrived and I was very excited to try it on. It was a very good thing I ordered the medium because I think the large would not have pulled me in as much at the waist. It pulled my waist down to 30"" and made my stomach nearly flat (I have had 2 children) all the while accentuating my lower A**ETTS (My fiance's favorite) . The material is fairly strong and feels sexy but you will want to wear a thin tank top/A-shirt under it because the metal bones tend to rub after a little bit. Also, I was very impressed with the thigh-high holders because they are metal with a rubber stopper instead of being all rubber like what I have seen in the past.  If you have any questions feel free to ask. So far, I am in love with it.",B000147652
"I bought this several years ago and am now ordering a second one. It really works well. Just so you know at first you will think it is too small but once you hook it up it fits snug but comfy. Start from the top when hooking together. It makes my waist look tiny and smooths my little muffin top, helps make tummy look flatter. I have bought several different kinds but this one is the only one I continue to use. Well worth the $30 I spent. I have it in black, in extra small. I am 5'2, 120, I use to be 100-110, but this still fits good. I call it my winter weight lol.",B000147652
I have used this s number of times and it is still in good condition.  It hasn't failed or frayed yet.,B000147652
"I bought this to give some extra support and more of a flatter look under my clothes. This was perfect. It's very comfortable to wear all day and has the perfect hold to it.

When I first put it on I thought it may be just a tad bit too small but once it was on it was just right.

Would definitely recommend.",B000147652
I bought a few rago items this weekend and they are all going back. This piece rolls down at the top. Not made  for short girls. I ordered right size so I am very unhappy. Expected better.,B000147652
"I bought this in hopes it would hold everything in tight under a nice dress, well its very bulky looking meaning others can definitely tell your wearing a girdle under neath. you can see the impression of the front closures thru your clothes. not very attractive. also if you have a long torso you may want to reconsider this piece as it didn't do well covering the back flab's. it continuously rolled down. and the front kept riding up exposing my baby pooch in front. not comfortable at all, big hassle to wear.",B000147652
"This waist cincher is perfect to accentuate an hourglass shape. The inner-contour bands in the middle help create a fierce silhouette. I regularly wear steel-boned corsets, and find this to be a great summer alternative. For comfort, I suggest wearing a corset liner underneath if you wear for an extended period of time. Next time I order, I will size down as it is not snug enough for my taste. Remember to buy cincher by waist measurement. Pair with a bullet bra for an extreme look that is bound to turn heads.",B000147652
the sizing chart was incorrect and its way too small for me... i recommend ordering 2 or 3 sizes bigger for a good fit,B000147652
"I consider this to be a mid quality cincher.  $40 is not a bad price for what you get...except do not expect the garters to hold up your stockings ...not only does it come undone a thousand times a day from your stockings, but the garter hooks come unhooked from the cincher as well.  Yes, a double wammy.  I will use it as a cincher alone.  Does anyone make proper garters anymore.",B000147652
"After reading all the reviews for this waist cincher, I have to admit that I was skeptical.  I ordered a medium because my measurements are 36-29-40, I weigh 145 lbs and am 5'3"".  I wanted to get the most bang for my buck since the product does not have a second row of hooks to allow me to tighten as my waist narrows.  When I took it out of the wrapper and proceeded to begin cinching, I was able to hook the first hook but at the bottom it was atleast 10"" apart and I thought ""uh oh...should have gotten the large!"".  Well, it is just like the other reviewers said..breathe in and begin hooking..it was like it just molded to my body. Amazing! My weight goes to my belly and the way that this product brought my waist in was nothing short of a miracle.  Head on..it makes me look like a barbie doll.  Now....from the side I still have a little belly thing going on but it is minimized considerably.  I wore it for 13 hours the second day and it was amazingly comfortable.  I did feel a little tension in my upper back after awhile but it truly works wonders to suppress the bloat that is a constant for me.  Just as another viewer said, when I took it off after 13 hours, my belly looked flatter and my waist still looked nipped in. Already, I want to purchase the small. I love, love, love this product!  I started trying on dresses that I had difficulty zipping up just to see the difference...there was one!  I bought the waist cincher with garters because it was cheaper than the version without and then just took the garters off.  I do want to invest in a pair of thigh highs though. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think there is an opportunity for the manufacturer to put a second row of hooks and then it would be perfect. Great product!",B000147652
Quality material with metal garters that actually stay latched. Provides nice amount of control without being uncomfortable. Is a little long for my body length but the length as shown in photos,B000147652
"Details: Item is clearly used! Item has lint on loops and every seam, smells like perfume tension from wear on hooks and creases down the sides!!!!!!!!!!!",B000147652
I figured for a me being a size 14 it would fit less snug for being up to a 3X.,B000147652
I have a small waist compared to my hips. Garments that cover both usually don't fit - either the waist is too large or the hips are too small. This sexy number fits snugly and perfectly. I really like the old-fashioned feel coupled with the sexy details and sheer mesh panels.  I love it!,B000147652
"Great fit, good quality, and I have nothing negative to say about it. Gave me a pronounced hourglass curve. Nice product.",B000147652
"Should have ordered small instead of extra small but it's ok , I'll lose weight why not.... I am aiming for size 24 anyways",B000147652
"I would have liked it to be a bit longer, but it fits well. I went a size down based on the measurements for an extreme hourglass shape and it does the trick.",B000147652
"MEASURE YOURSELF, I cannot stress that enough, don't guess. If you don't have a soft tape measure use yarn or thread then cut and compare to measuring tape in the tool box. BUT DONT GUESS. this does what it is supposed to. It goes up real high so if you are wearing a low back dress this won't work. It's not the most comfy thing but it works.",B000147652
"I would recommend this cincher to any lady who wants to nip her waist down a couple of inches.  Or, if you want to cut back on your food portions.  :)
Seriously though, it's a tight fit and may take some wear to shape to your body.  But, I purchased two cinchers and this one fits exactly as expected.",B000147652
Love it!! Exactly what I was expecting. I recommend this to anyone looking for a cute nice fit garter belt. Good quality.,B000147652
"this product is phenomenal, i have already lost some weight around my waist now the waist cincher is large, i have to order a smaller size. wohhoooooo",B000147652
This is my second waist cincher from this company & although I've never used any others I think that this company possibly Makes The Best products. It gives me a beautiful defined waist and although it takes a while to get use to it becomes comfortable enough to not notice. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it has the tendency to curl up at the bottom causing lumps n bumps on my clothing & also because unlike the first cincher I bought this only has one row of hooks. I see weird posts about size & can't really speak to them except to say that I bought the size that is 2 inches smaller than my natural waist. If you buy the same size of your waist I assume it would give you an hour glass shape but you would look no smaller. Buying based on hip size would never work for me. I think you must keep in mind how pliable your flesh is and if it would be plausible to fit in a cincher 2 - 4 inches smaller Than Your A natural waist or not.,B000147652
Exactly what I wanted and fits perfectly. I'm tiny (5' and 98lbs) and the xs was just right. Thank you.,B000147652
"I'm petite (5'2"", 102 lbs) but have a bit of a mummy tummy. This doesn't really hold me in so much as it reminds me to suck in my gut and sit/stand up straight. It's sort of uncomfortable up at my ribs but I can wear it for several hours without complaint. It does show under clothes so I have to be strategic about what I wear it with. I also wear a cotton camisole underneath as it is itchy directly against the skin.",B000147652
"nice material, definitely holds you in but it can be a pain to get on. also the garter bits have tendency to slip out of place.",B000147652
"I love Rago products. As someone who loves wearing corsets, these are the perfect solution to giving you that perfect hourglass silhouette under your clothing.
The biggest issue I have with these particular waist cinchers is that if you order a smaller size (to get extra shaping) be prepared to get poked by the boning after 4+ hours of wear. I've actually taken to sticking a thin knee-high sock at the very top (around my ribs) to prevent poking or other irritation. After doing that, I've experienced nothing but comfort.
Love, love, love these products and would buy again. I have one in white and black.
Also just bought their smaller waist-cinching garter belt - it's perfect!",B000147652
This product does exactly what it describes it will do. It cinches your waist giving you a smoother look. It doesn't ride up on the sides and it is very comfortable to wear.,B000147652
"The Cincher is sturdy but still allows for good movement. I have a 28 or 29 waistline and the small fits fine.  I would give it a 5 star except that the front where the hooks do show a little when wearing tops that hug your body.  But overall, for the price, I found this very pleasing.  I would recommend purchasing it if you're on a budget and your top has some way of concealing the front hooks.",B000147652
"This is the most slimming undergarment I ever bought. It is VERY tight, so it's a bit difficult to breathe in (like a corset). However, it's worth it because it makes me look at least 2 sizes smaller, and even holds in my hips (which are the bane of my existence in dresses). I am planning on wearing it for my wedding and hoping I'll make it through the night with less oxygen!",B000147652
I wear a missy 14 and ordered this in 2x but its too small.  I am still losing weight so will keep it for later.  Disappointed when I went to put it on for date night.,B000147652
"This waist cincher is comfortable but runs slightly big.  I have a 27 inch waist and 37 inch hips.  I ordered the small. It fits well on my hips but is a bit large around the waist, so it doesn't really ""cinch"" as much as I would like.  The detachable garter straps are NOT a good idea.  The small elastic loops on the waist cincher to which the garter straps are attached via metal hooks began to rip after the first wear.  In addition, the metal hooks that attach the garter straps to the waist cincher dug into my thighs.  The hooks also had  tendency to slip out of the loop.  During one trip to the ladies room I had unhooked the stockings from the garter straps. The straps then detached from the cincher itself and almost fell into the toilet!  After a couple more mishaps I decided to sew the garter straps to the cincher directly.  It was fairly easy to do with a sewing machine. Now it works great. The straps are no longer detachable obviously, so I can't use the waist cincher without them.  However, you probably wouldn't want to do that anyway, as without being attached to a pair of stockings the waist cincher will ride up and you will find yourself having to pull it back down every few minutes. All in all, I'm happy with it.",B000147652
"Fits as expected. Excellent item, repeat buy for us, so no suprises or disapointments!  The wife has two of these, a white and now a black one.",B000147652
i love this. i have fibromyalgia and scoliosis and this lets me have my great posture back again. i am a petite woman and probably could have gone down one size but this works great. i donkt have much of a belly but it holds in what i do have. love it.,B000147652
"I honestly didn't have high hopes for this undergarment. I've purchased other tummy control type products and thought they were a waste of money. I've warn this quite a few times since it arrives. And I think this product is the cat's meow. It noticeable slims the waste.

But I do agree with other reviewers who complain about the product digging into your flesh. However, I offer solutions. First, I think that perhaps some are not wearing the undergarment properly. The woman in the pic is wearing the cincher just underneath the bra. So what I did to eliminate digging is to tuck the chincher under my bra a bit (in the front and back). And this did help to eliminate this a bit. However, what really eliminated digging was to wear one of those control top type pantie girdle thingy majiggs on top of the underwear and cincher. I noticed this eliminated another issue as well. The control top panties hid the ribbing. Unfortunately, the chincher ribbing is visible through my shearer form-fitting pencil skirts. But with the control top panties the ribbing outline is not visible. I hope this helps someone. F.Y.I. I am a size 10 curvaceous woman. However, I've let my figure go to pot so my waist is large. I gots me a dunlap (unfortunately). :-(",B000147652
"I was needing something that was a little more practical than a garter to hold up some stockings and this caught my eye.  It fits snug, as it should, but it definitely takes a little effort to get all of the clasps together.  You also have to make sure it's positioned well so that you don't have a muffin-top situation, but it really isn't that big of an issue.  If you are a little leery of this, then I'd size up, but then you kind of miss the point of having a girdle...  My current waist size is about 27, so I ordered the medium and I am happy that I did.

All in all, I really love this and the price is very doable for a product like this.  An extra benefit of wearing this, other than looking slimmer and more of an hourglass, is that it helps your posture out...no slouching here!  The fact that the garters are detachable is delightful and makes it little more bang for your buck.",B000147652
"The product is well made and appears durable.  However, the sizing is inaccurate.  I am plump in the belly (therefore the waist cincher) so I ordered an XL instead of my usual L.  The cincher is still too small to reach around and hook.  I am in the process of losing weight so am hoping to use this after another 10 pound loss.",B000147652
"This cincher is as firm as they get and chisels out a fantastic waist. If you're looking for a great silhouette under fitted clothes that aren't too clingy, this is your secret weapon. It's my go-to shapewear when wearing jeans and a button-front sweater, or with dresses that nip in at the waist (the garters are very sturdy) but don't cling to the body. Button-front sweaters hide the hooks in front of the cincher--which will otherwise show through clothes--and if you're a bit ""fluffy"" in back this might not be the best choice for you under fabrics that closely show the shape of your back (it might blend with the line of your bra... it might not). Overall it's a solid and well-used part of my shapewear wardrobe. Note: Rago has a line of products that are not always identified clearly in Amazon; check out [...] for details.",B000147652
This item runs so small. I had to return it twice and it still did not fit. I usually wear a size 16 XL and ordered a 2X based on the reviews. Then a 3 x.  Something about me just does not wish to admit that i might need anything larger.,B000147652
"Love this, I never wear dresses and so I bought this just to make sure I didn't regret the one time I needed to wear one. I loved it, it was comfortable and kept my posture straight.",B000147652
"This waist cincher is just what I hoped for and more. After carefully reading the reviews, I ordered the large even though my waist is 33 inches. I was worried that it wouldn't fit or make much difference, but the results were fantastic. It highlights my hourglass figure and makes me feel much more confident in clingy dresses. As others have mentioned, it won't work under very clingy and thin fabrics because the fasteners will show through.

I have worn this for hours at a time, including on a long car ride, and it is more comfortable than expected. It also helps my posture, which is nice. FInally, I appreciate that it is easy to care for--I just wash it on the delicate or handwash cycle and hang to dry. I was so pleased with it that I ordered another in beige.",B000147652
"Used this for my wedding dress. I love it so much I use it often. I tend to wear shape wear a lot so I didn't find this to be uncomfortable. For someone who doesn't wear shapewear yeah this might be uncomfortable, but all shapewear is.",B000147652
"As a curvy woman I was nervous about how this would fit, but the fit is perfect. The quality is really good as well. Would've given five stars except the garters are a little tough to work.",B000147652
"Okay, it's not really better than exercise, but with this I finally have the hourglass figure I've been working so hard for. I'm more of a rectangle and even at my skinniest never had an hourglass figure. Now I do! The Medium/28"" started to fit at about 28.75"" waist measurement.",B000147652
"Not as trimming as a full-on corsette, but if you need to be active it allows a lot more movement while still doing a great job ;-)",B000147652
"I purchased this in hopes to make my pretty straight figure have a little curve as well as hide the fact that I have had a baby and am a little squishy.  I wore it for my Halloween costume and was super impressed with how well it holds.  The only down side was it started to hurt my back after about 8 hours of wear.  This cincher is sturdy and light at the same time and has great hold.  I did order a 30"" even though my waist is 33"" which may be why my back was sore.  It may also just be my normal back issues.  Either way I would purchase this again in a heartbeat.  Super cute and comfortable for quite a while!",B000147652
this is so great i love it it gives me the curves i want and makes me feel super sexy,B000147652
"As others had said, this will give you the pin up shape. Unfortunately for me, this means it minimized my waist, but did little for my hips, and as such gave me what I consider an odd shape. Which was a bummer, because it fit well and was actually pretty comfortable. I returned it and will be ordering something with a bit more control for my hips.",B000147652
"I bought this to wear under a Halloween costume that was very tight and very short. I got the 2x/3x and I am about 5'8 and about 175lbs. I usually wear a 14 but most of my weight is concentrated around my tummy (gotta love being an Apple body type) and I wanted something that would pull that in and give me more of an hourglass silhouette. I have tried a few other pieces of shape wear in the past but this was the first I tried that had a hook and eye closure and boning as opposed to the stretchy pull-on styles which seemed to roll a lot. I loved that this really targeted the problem areas for me and that it was long enough to pull down all the way over my tummy. However, I am short-waisted and long-legged so I think this could potentially not be long enough for someone with a really long torso who is trying to cover up that lower belly fat. I loved that it came up just high enough not to interfere with my bra and seemed to be made of quality material. It was more comfortable than I thought it was going to be and I wore it to three different events.  Definitely glad I did the research and decided on this waist cincher because of the reviews.",B000147652
"Attention girls over 5'10"": This waist cincher is not for you. It's obviously just not made for tall girls (I am 6'1""). While it does provide minimal support and looks nice, this was way too short to hold all of me in. Extremely disappointed, but if you're tall, just opt for Spanx instead. They'll do a much better job and are much more comfortable.",B000147652
"I am updating my review for this item. At the time when I ordered it, I should have known with a 35 inch waist a cincer with a 30 inch waist was going to be very difficult to put on. It is now 3 years later, and I recently dug this cincher out again to waist train with. Today my waist is 30 inches, and this cincher takes it down by about two inches or so, and gives me a very nice figure, I love it! Just be sure to order the cincher at your ACTUAL waist size, not less than it, or if you absolutely want it smaller then only do one size down. It is well made and has held up for me wearing it every single day for several weeks. five stars!",B000147652
"It can be a little tight, but it is the best waist cincher I have had. Plus the bonus of making it a garter is super sexy...",B000147652
"If you're looking for a good waist-cincher that will give you that epic big hip, small waist look, this is it!
The material its made of are top notch, the price is reasonable. The garters are metal, not cheap plastic.
Only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five, is because the hooks and garters show through when wearing something tight like a pencil dress. This would probably work much better for something like an A-line dress.",B000147652
"This was amazing and I absolutely love it! It wasn't too restricting like I had imagined it would be and it made my curves look amazing!  Sturdy, good quality, I have a feeling this is going to last me a long time! Thanks!",B000147652
"This made me feel like Christina Hendricks. It takes two inches off my waist, while still remaining comfortable enough to wear all day. Without a longline bra, it creates upper back bulges, which is only expected considering the cinching. The biggest problem is that the hook and eye closures are extremely noticeable under thinner clothing, especially knits. When worn under thick crepe or tweed dress with lining or a slip, it appears invisible. The quality is fantastic and has me hooked onto Rago.",B000147652
Did leave a few small marks at the end of the night from the boning digging into the upper part of my torso. But for hours of wear it was worth it.,B000147652
"I bought this after borrowing one from my cross-dressing friend to wear to a party. It works great, fits fantastic, and stays in place through a vigorous night of dancing, and i stretches so you can breath wearing it. highly recommended.",B000147652
Does everything I need it too! Took about 3 inches off my waist and flattened everything out trough my mid section. Love the way i look under my dress with this!,B000147652
"Go off of the measurements and not the dress size. I went off the dress size and it was a bit small but still gave me a nice shape. For the price its a good buy and its hides very well under clothing. I would buy it again, just in a bigger size",B000147652
I washed it one time and started to have problems. When I wore it stayed in place and held everything together then I washed it and the stitching started to come loose. I had to sew some of the hooks back in place but it still worked. Maybe the idea is not to keep it on long but I wanted to wear it to work. (they say women carry themselves differently if you wear things like this under your cloths). So I needed it for longer wear which this did not stand up to all the daily movement.,B000147652
And that's what it is...I needed my husband to help strap me in it.  I have a 26 inch waist that became 24 inch!!  Haven't worn it to an event to see if I can sit or eat in it yet...,B000147652
"So, I thought I would go ahead and order one size smaller than I measure (My waist is 28 when I suck in, but I got the small which is 26), which was probably not the best idea because I can't say this is super comfortable after several hours of wear.  I can say, however, that it gives me a noticeable (measurable) waist reduction as well as some great back support in a fairly flexible way.  I can wear for several hours and it gets me into a few dresses I thought I would have to lose weight for. Measuring over the top of it, this thing is holding my waist an inch smaller than I can suck it in an hold it with the tape measure tight--and it's certainly more comfortable than trying to do *that* all evening. It seems to do a decent job compressing the ribcage in, which a lot of shapers can't really do, which may be why it works so well.  It's much more powerful than another, slip-on waist cincher I own and definitely was a good value for the price.",B000147652
"Nice and tight fit, helps to give my mid section more shape. I will only use this brand it has been the best for me.",B000147652
"Absolutely fabulous! Put it on, it fit very tight as expected. Wore it all day. It breathed and I never felt strangled. It did push the girls up so if you are large in that area you will have to wear it lower so it doesn't rub below them boobies. I originally took the stocking suspenders off but the put them back to try a daring black set of stockings, Wow sexy.",B000147652
"I had an back surgery and bought this for fashionable support and then to continue wearing back to work with stockings.  It does fit nice and snugly whereas others are too loose and does cinch you in, but when worn without the garter, the entire bottom rolls up and is visible under clothing.  When i wore it with elastic garters provided , the metal clips do not stay closed and the length varies all day long and the actual clips that hold onto the stockings do NOT stay closed either.",B000147652
"While snug, I can wear it and it looks great. And it isn't noticeable under my clothes. Overall, I'm very satisfied.",B000147652
"For years I've wondered how plus-size models look so, well, smooth. It never occurred to me that they were wearing something like this. (duh)

I've worn Spanx, but it in no way slims and smooths like this waist cincher! It's very much like I would imagine a corset would be, with hook-and-eye closures all along the front. I find it extremely comfortable, particularly for my back.

The only thing to be aware of is this: Be sure to wear it so that the top of it lies along the OUTSIDE of the bottom band of your bra; otherwise, it can pinch the skin between your bra and this garment. No biggie though. Once I figured that out (uh, the first time I wore it), I was all set.

I am 5'4"" and weigh 180, and I ordered the X-LG/32 which fits perfectly. It takes some effort to close, but once it's on it's soooo comfy.",B000147652
"And the garter straps make it even better! I think I may have ordered it little bit big (i got the large) but eh, I'm only 5' tall but weigh 134 lbs. and have big hips. All the same, I feel absolutely fabulous in this and the material isn't bad at all! Definitely will shop with them again :)",B000147652
I love the curves I get when I wear this. My wife likes the look this gives me when I get all dressed up!,B000147652
"this cincher is beautiful. it fits perfectly and gives a beautiful shape, accentuating the waist at it's smallest. it doesn't bulge or bow when standing and still feels secure when seated. The bottom hem tends to roll up a little if the garters are not attached but only when bending at the hips.
i would buy again",B000147652
"I just got this and let me tell you it is perfect!  The size gage is a little off, but I love it. Very nice and comfortable!!!",B000147652
"Definitely stops the muffin top and cinches the waist. Here is my experience with the sizing which is always tricky when buying online:  I have gained a lot of weight over the last 2 years and haven't been exercising so I am all flabby / mushy.  Height 5'-7-1/2"", my chest under the bust is 36"", bust is 42"", waist is 41"", and widest part of hip/butt is 47"". I can barely squeeze into some (US size) 16 pants , some 16's fit just fine, and then some 18 pants are way too loose. I debated between getting the 2X or the 3X.  I bought the 2X based on the sizing chart that was provided. It definitely cinches the sides and smoothes the waist and controls the love handles.  The upper edge meets right at the lower edge of the bra line and as long as I pay close attention to my posture I don't have a flab bulge there - but if I slouch I get a bulge above the product's upper edge.  Maybe I should have bought the 3X because my problem is the lower edge and my 47"" hips even though the sizing chart lists the 2X 18W-20W hips as being 48""-50"". All is smooth down to the lower edge where the product ends and then my uncinched hips and butt bulge out  from under it (mainly because I am not toned and my hips/butt/thighs are pure flab).  However, this will motivate me to start walking and toning again and then maybe someday real soon I can buy the next smaller size!  Overall I am pleased with this product.",B000147652
I am very happy with this! Make sure you order from the sizing chart and NOT by dress size. Super comfortable and flattering. Would have given it 5 stars if it had 6 garter straps instead of 4.,B000147652
"Hooray!  I tried some spandex cinchers and slips at a department store, but was not impressed.  So I went on Amazon and found a handful of promising solutions.  Based on the visual appeal, price and reviews, I easily chose this one.  I'm ecstatic.  I did wear some thigh high sheers not because I needed them (I had a full length dress), but thought it would help keep the cincher in place.  Was afraid of the bottom back part rolling up.  Don't really know if I needed it.  Was easy to put on!  Felt sexy.  Just was going for a flat and tight look.  Since it's the start of spring, I haven't been as physically active and still had a few pounds from the long winter.  Couldn't tell that it was under my dress.",B000147652
"VERY NICE, JUST THE SIZING CHART IS INCORRECT ( a 2X is really not a 2X )
HAD TO RETURN, BUT REORDERED A BIGGER SIZE",B000147652
Does the job. I think I am just more into comfort and less interested in the fit.  I ordered it to use as a garter belt because I hate pantyhose.  It works.,B000147652
This is an excellent product providing firm tummy control and can be worn with or without suspenders. It might be wise to order one size smaller as it has lots of stretch. Over a short period of time it mold to your body making it very comfortable.,B000147652
"This product was an impulse buy for me, but one of my better ones.  I own a full quality corset (boning, steel clasps) that, while it looks fantastic, I could never wear all day.  This product, while only being fabric and plastic, shapes my body almost as well as my corset does, and is comfortable enough to wear all day.  I'm shocked that it shapes me so well while letting me breathe normally (via my diaphragm, not my chest).  Also I think $40 for a combo body shaper/garter belt is a great deal, it looks stunning with the garter and hose.  I don't think the product description is explicit enough - you can actually remove those garter straps and wear the cincher on its own.",B000147652
"I have a 36"" waist & 41""hips & got the XL (32"") it definitely shapes me & makes my waist a bit more hourglass-y (reduces it to 34"") in a natural way ... looks pretty good. I am considering purchasing the large to see if that gives me a more va-va-voom look... Overall, I'm happy though, flattens out my stomach & 'pooch' (in a natural way though - it's there a smidge, but that's just how it goes when you're chubby like me)",B000147652
I like this product it does smooth out the muffin top and back bulge I wear it with my control top hose so as to smooth out the bottom of my stomach makes me look so much slimmer makes my tops fit much more nicely it feels pretty comfortable I like the look it gives me,B000147652
"This waist cincher is perfect for those who don't have a whole lot to pack in, but want a smooth, long line.  I also like it because the garter straps can be significantly shortened, so the tops of my stockings are not down near my knees at the end of the day.  It is comfortable but sturdy - no weird poking or pinching - and it holds its shape throughout the day.  Finally, this is much more visually appealing than most waist cinchers/tummy flatteners out there.  Highly recommended.",B000147652
It did what I wanted it to do so I am very satisfied! I didn't have any problems putting it on or taking it off either and it held up perfectly!,B000147652
this was my first time buying one of these.. I didn't know what to do because I was between sizes (the waist measurements of LARGE and the hip measurements of MEDIUM... no ideea how that happend..)  I have a 30 in waist and 38 in hips.. Fits great!! (medium) almost 50's still hour glass look.. that's not really my thing but the hubby loves it so that's why I gave it 5 stars ;-),B000147652
"It could have been a bit bigger since it was a 2x.  I'm an 18 and I have to inhale sharply to put it on.  If I were any bigger, it probably wouldn't fit.",B000147652
"I own one in large for a more comfy fit and one in medium for a more extreme hourglass shape. Only get this if you want the hourglass, pin-up sillouette. Most shapers give you a thinner but more gradual curve ( which I could care less for) this gives you a 'Va-Va-Vavoom' look that I looove! I wish this style came in nude though....",B000147652
"5'6""

This makes my stomach and love handles look completely flat and gives me a near perfect waist. And it's comfy. I love it.",B000147652
I was very impressed with the sturdy construction of this product.  It did what is was supposed to and didn't feel like it was going to explode when I wore it. The metal nibs on the stays are top notch and the sewing is heavy duty which makes me very happy.,B000147652
"Ordered for my better half, she loves to wear it under a dress. Shapes well, easy on and off and open bottom makes it easy going to the restroom. Garters can be removed but works well with nylon stockings",B000147652
"This waist cincher is incredible. I have a very small waist, and until now have not been able to find a cincher that is both small enough for me and in my price range. I bought it for the back support, but found that it somehow manages to not only flawlessly support my poor, C-curve scoliosis-ridden spine, but also to mold even my tiny bit of fat into Marilyn Monroe-level curves. Overall it is a really fantastic product, but I would not recommend wearing it with an underwire bra, as the wires and the edges of the boning will pinch you if you bend over even slightly. I suspect this design is very old, and therefore meant to be worn with old-school, circle-stitched bullet bras, since I have no trouble when I wear it with one of those. However, if you don't want to run the risk of poking out anyone's eye with your lady lumps I suspect a regular soft cup bra would be fine.

My one complaint is that this model doesn't actually seem to come with garters, at least not the black version. I had to dismantle a garter belt and stitch the straps onto the bottom of this thing.",B000147652
"This is without a doubt my favorite shapewear product.  It has very firm control and really nips in the waist for an hourglass look.  The garters are removable.  It is super-sexy worn with stockings.  The garters are heavy duty, not the flimsy boudoir variety.  I followed the size chart and ordered an XL for my 33"" waist. It is a perfect fit and is long enough to cover my post-pregnancy pooch.  Be aware that the front hooks will show under clingy knits.",B000147652
"I love this waist cincher, as it more than does the job it was intended to do.  I wear it all day in comfort.  It is not binding.  I especially like the metal and rubber garters (very durable) as I'm a stocking girl.  I can also wear it with pants, too. I also enjoy wearing it for those ""special"" evenings,under a slinky dress, sometimes only with stockings and nothing else!  Rago rocks!",B000147652
"This is the best shape garment I own.  It slips on easily and does what it is intended to do - cinch up the waist.  It is well made, as all Rago products are.  Plus, since I love to wear stockings, I love the garters.  I especially like to wear it to work under a skirt, and sometimes without panties!  I will order another in a different color.",B000147652
"My Rago waist cincher is really nice to wear - does not
ride up, roll down or show. the garters hold my stockings
and i wear nyon panties under. I just do not have that
""girdled look"".",B000147652
"As another reviewer mentioned, it's hard to find an XS girdle/shaper and this one certainly does the job of taking away a couple inches off my waist to look great in wedding dress. However all of the cinching is at the waist and perhaps not enough in the hip area which gives you an almost unnatural silhouette: tiny waist, big hips, flattened top of butt - my torso and hips feel a bit like 2 sausage links separated at the waist but on the good side it gives you a very 50s  bombshell figure under the RIGHT type of clothes. I don't recommend wearing it under fitted or slinky clothing, for me that looks a little bizarre and you can clearly see the hooks. But it is perfect under layered clothing, much like a wedding dress!",B000147652
"I wanted something comfortable for my wedding dress that didn't feel like I was being squeezed, but simple redistributed. This was perfect! I wore it all night, dancing and taking photos. Felt great!",B000147652
"I have ordered these before, and knew what to expect. I don't use it as a waist cincher but more of a truss for a hernia. I turn it inside out, all hooked up, put it on upside down and then fold it as it should be to fit. I imagine this would be the easiest way for anyone to deal with it.
I always hand wash them, and find that they last a long time.",B000147652
"One of the latches was not sewn in correctly and is about to fall off, was only able to wear a handful of times. Also, I have an average size torso and this is too short. Very disappointed with this purchase.",B000147652
rolls slightly at the bottom when not pinned by garters.,B000147652
Garters in back go straight over the buttocks. This causes strain when sitting.,B000147652
Perfect fit!! The one I had before was a little big so I sized down. Nice foundation under clothes and also gives back support.,B000147652
"Does exactly what it says, comfortable yet great control in the waist. This is the best investment that I've made so far this year. I look gorgeous!!",B00014761G
"This is true to size and works great for me with lower back pain, Gives the support needed and I am thankful after several months that I ordered it,",B00014761G
"Love this.. I actually could have ordered a size smaller, as it doesn't squeeze me in but does hold everything.. I love love love this thing and have since ordered another..

I am 5'5"" ~150#s 38-33-41 and I think I got a 34.. I could have gone a size down, but was hesitant due to reviews stating that it was too tight.. I personally love tightlacing corsets and can tolerate the squeeze.. this in no way squeezes me uncomfortably, but keeps me from bulging in unflattering ways under dresses..

Two thumbs way up!",B00014761G
"I have a long torso and was expecting something longer based on the picture. I will say that the fabric is very very firm, so there is very little stretch up, down, or around your midsection. Compression is good, I would be happier if this would be longer, honestly. 5'9"", size 4xl for reference.",B00014761G
"Good product, but fits small. I bought the 3x and really could use the 4x. I am a small size 16.",B00014761G
"Quite dissapointed in this, it is way too small for my 36",B00014761G
this will be god for me to wear if I have to go some where and I want my tummy sucked in.  I thought this would work with my compression socks but straps are short.  also will be too uncomfortable to wear at work,B00014761G
Does its job and smooths me out although I would have loved for it be a little tighter because doesn't exactly 'cinch' anything but I'll use it as a decorative piece to hold up my thigh highs.,B00014761G
"sent it back, sizing was way off",B00014761G
To bring g should've ordered a size 2x,B00014761G
Not too bad. Hard to get on. Little uncomfortable but worth what I paid for,B00014761G
"I love this! The only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars was because I can see the clasps running down the front of it when wearing a thinner material over it.  It is very comfortable, it doesn't roll, or slide, or sag; it stays where it is put.  I was a little afraid that I ordered the wrong size as it seemed as though it would be way too big, but I followed the instructions as to how to measure and went with the size they said, and it fit perfectly!  I am very happy with this product and would definitely buy it again in another color!",B00014761G
"A lot of reviews say to order a size larger than your actual size, but I disagree I bought the 3x/36 and my waist is about 2-3 inches larger than that, it'll take a little bit of work to get it on but it's something that's made to be super tight so buying a larger size might not do what it's intended to. Also if you've got a pretty round belly it might sit lower on your body than the picture in order to nip it all in. Either way I definitely recommend for someone who's just starting or needs something cheap in a pinch.",B00014761G
This is the PERFECT waist cincher/garter belt. I looked smoking hot. But one of the garter strap loops ripped off of the bodice the very first time I wore it. :( I'll order another. Maybe I was a little too rough on it.,B00014761G
"Don't ignore the comments on how small these run. I ordered a Size 3X/36.  This is not even close to a 3X and should not be called plus size. The part of the size you need to pay attention to is the second number, in this case the 36. This garment is 36"" in circumference around where the hook and eye closure stops at the bottom.  Look carefully, the hook and eye stops and the garment sort of slopes down in a graduated line, the widest part of the slope is at the very back of the garment it is about 2 inches. If you lay the garment on the floor and measure from bottom hook to bottom eye this is where it measures 36"".  This would fall at the widest part of your hips and bum. Not sure about you gals, but I don't call someone with 36 inch hips a Plus Size.",B00014761G
It fits amazing and looks great on! I'm really satisfied.,B00014761G
"I like the cincher, but one does need to order at least two sizes larger than what would appear to ""fit"" you.  Others have noted this, also.",B00014761G
"I wear an 18 and bought a 4X. The fit was perfect. snug, but not pinching anything and causing pain. I do wish that the wires or whatever they are were stiffer because it rolls and doesn't hold shape as much as I had hoped. It's just ok. For the price, I'd probably try something else.",B00014761G
hated these years ago and still not a fan,B00014761G
"Fantastic product, hooks are sturdy with nice velcro under to protect from rubbing metal on skin. I will suggest you size very carefully, if this product is too large it will create a shapeless look,instead of the intended hourglass figure!",B00014761G
"Very nice, just right, comfortable if right size, lightweight, breathable and gives light shape to waist.",B00014761G
Ordered the product for a friend and came as expected and on time  fit but was loose and should have ordered the next size down.,B00014761G
"This item was a bit smaller than I expected, but it does its job beautifully! The only thing is that I have to mind how I move or it will shift. Good product though!",B00014761G
"RAGO definitely knows what they are doing. Comfortable, well made garments that actually do what they are supposed to do. And they make them in larger sizes which is sadly rare for shapewear garments. I cannot recommend the brand highly enough.",B00014761G
For the price point I had higher expectations of this product. I'm a true size 24 so I got the 8 xl. It would be nice if it had a second row of hooks as well. I will sat that it does a decent job of shaping until you begin to move around .,B00014761G
"Yes, I said life-saver. Because as someone who hates & detests girdles (because they're evil) this is the one thing that I will wear. It works under rompers & ball gowns alike. Hell yes to this purchase if you're a plus sized girl...",B00014761G
"i like the product, but do not wear for long periods of time. It slides around and pokes you. Gets very uncomfortable. The sizes are weird as well, i had already ordered a size up, but even that was way too small, i wound up going 2 more sizes up. when i exchanged i got the product 2 days later. The exchange process went really well.",B00014761G
"The first one I ordered was a bit too small. HOWEVER I had no problems exchanging for the correct size! Quick and painless!! The one that fits......Well, I'll just say va-va-voom!!",B00014761G
Not alone does ithis waist cincher look sexy it feels sexy when wearing it. With a super  large figure the garters-suspenders stretch down to the stockings-nylons which are luckily above the knees  because of the big legs and thigh size. Everything looks so sexy even with a short skirt. It creates so much femininity for larger than large ladies and gives us the opportunity to be even sexier than our slim counterparts.,B00014761G
This IS your grandma's girdle! High quality and made just like they used to be. Good for getting the proper silhouette under your 50s wiggle dress. Highly recommend.,B00014761G
"It was a little large, but still fits good and it looks good. I should have actually ordered one smaller size.",B00014761G
"Va-Va-Voom!  Take the time to look up the sizing, I wear an 18 and needed a 4X.  If you can get past the sizing, this is a fabulous , I put it on and was amazed, the bottom edge is less compression so that it doesn't create a dent on the hip.  I haven't worn garters in years, and can't wait to wear them again.",B00014761G
"I got the largest size and 3X, but it was still smaller than I expected. I do not know if this just run smaller than expected. When I opened the box, there was no invoice. I am going to return it.",B00014761G
I got this to go under my pin up dresses and its beyond amazing! Unless the dress is super tight with thin fabric you can't see it at all. Really a va-va-voom look,B00014761G
Love it very nice Love it love it love it there is not much more I can say but I love it,B00014761G
"When this item came it fit beautifully, cinched my waist perfectly, didn't pinch or cause pain.  However, it has been less than a week and the stitching is coming out already!  The stitch per inch ratio is too low for such a garment.  I am going to have to reinforce all the seams if I want to continue to wear this cincher. Too bad too because it cinches perfectly.  Gives me an hourglass figure and takes 5 inches off my waist.",B00014761G
"I was hoping for a firmer hold, but it worked well.  The garter hooks can come off the cincher if you don't sit up straight",B00014761G
This is my first rago product and I love it they are the best shapewear I've ever had it holds my stockings great and slims well I do wish it had a extra garter on the side for a little more support though but I do love it.,B00014761G
"I love it! It covers my problem area (lower stomach) and the belts hold up my stocking quite well....but it's loose (and a sagging, bagging lingerie piece is just not appealing). But I think it's my fault for buying too big of a size. Oh, well!",B00014761G
"The fabric was way too stretchy to actually hold anything in, and the bones were super flimsy. Within three minutes of putting it on, the ""boning"" in the back had already bent and was jabbing me in the back. I returned it.",B00014761G
"it runs large
reordering a third time from a 7X to a 5X and now a 4X.  .I weight 220 and have 40 inch waist....like that there is no back fat hangover as there was with my corsette. this is much more comfortable",B00014761G
"I've heard such rave reviews about this brand, so I had to purchase this. Unfortunately, I was kind of disappointed. It looked cheap, was made of thin material, and didn't provide much support.",B00014761G
"Purchased for my Lady, was worn, used and nasty looking. Amazon should be totally ashamed for trying to resell products like this.",B00014761G
Boning came out after 2nd wear.,B00014761G
"I've had this for a year now and it still holds up excellently. I you follow the sizing chart, you can't go wrong. I plan to buy another as I'm loosing weight and it's a bit loose now. It's also very sexy and the garters can stretch down to your knees and not really tug the entire piece down your body. Overall love it. Only downside is that you can easily loose the garters.",B00014761G
Didn't fit me quite as I would have liked but did the job somewhat it's not bad but it's not great but it'll get the job done,B00014761G
"(Wife's review on my account):
It's Rago, fits very well.  Supports my back on long walks. Certainly holds-up my stockings when I attach/use the garters.  Perfect.  Would buy again, perhaps in an alternative color.",B00014761G
"Make sure you use the numbers (inches) to help you see what size you need. If you have back problems, then this might not be for you. It works great with compression stockings and cinches to make you feel beautiful.",B00014761G
It is very short & quite a challenge to fasten even with ordering up a size! Not sure I will be purchasing anything else,B00014761G
"it was new,thought it was original so, not that happy. wanted one from 1977not a remake. did i read that wrong?",B00015HG38
"This is a classic shirt, the best!  Bought a new one because my original has seen better days.  Was afraid of the quality now and if it would match up to the old one.  To my surprise the shirt is very comfortable and close to the old one.  Definitely recommend this shirt.",B00015HG38
"i ordered this for my son and the quality was horrible. You would think for the price it would be on a better quality shirt not fruit of the loom, The design was also crooked on the front.",B00015HG38
"Great shirt, correct size and fit.  Good material and should last a long time thru several washes.  Will order more in the future.",B00015HG38

"Bought this for my dad for Father's Day. Led Zeppelin is his favorite band and he saw them on this tour when they came to Baltimore, but never bought the shirt. The fabric is wonderfully soft and it gives him a trip down memory lane every time he wears it. Awesome!",B00015HG38
"Finally found the shirt I have wanted for so long, and at a price I thought was ok. If you order this shirt order a size bigger. They tend to run small. I took a chance and ordered 1 size larger and fits perfect. Ladies Zep fans should note that for some reason the tour dates are not on the back of your shirt. Order the men's.",B00015HG38
"It obviously isn't cotton, as the product description would have you believe.  The back isn't printed, as an authentic reproduction's back would be.  It's not cut to XL size.  But it WAS really inexpensive, so I guess that's something.",B00015HG38
The image of the shirt in the picture is not an accurate representation of the product that I received. Additi,B00015HG38
Worst shirt ever. Fake plastic graphics are different than what was shown on website. Sent wrong size. Cheap material.  Keeps stalling on refund wants to replace with another crappy shirt. Do not buy. Cheap junk ripoff.,B00015HG38
"Nice shirt. Not a cotton T, rather a nylon double layer. Good fit.",B00015HG38
I love this shirt. It has held up since I ordered it 2 years ago. It fits good and is true to size. I'm ordering again from this company.,B00015HG38
Very poor quality T-Shirt. Runs on the small side. Will not purchase from this vendor again.,B00015HG38
"RIP OFF, front side was as expected but back side was totally blank,wasn't expecting a genuine 40 year old concert tee, but at least a faithful replica this is BS",B00015HG38
I was replacing my old shirt that I bought at the  show. I love the added print of cities on the back but dissatisfied with the bulky shoulders fit of the shirt. Looks like I have wings I wear it.,B00015HG38
It is way to small for a 2x I would put it at a large. I cant fit into it. I think the print is a little week also.,B00015HG38
"Had been wanting to replace my Houston Texas Summit Arena tour shirt for over 30 years now & finally have,

"I bought these thinking they would be a quality ""summer time"" panty...wow...these things are very flimsy, like a pair of thin nylons that your fingers would push through.  Not what I expected for the high price Gossamer needs for these.  Went to Victoria's Secret and Jockey for what I needed.",B00015HDVI
"I only wish I had found these bikinis earlier in life.  They are the only one that doesn not leave a panty line of any kind, that is so whisper thin, you don't feel like you're wearing them.  If you wash them by hand they will last a very long time.",B00015HDVI
"This is an amazing product. They are very comfortable and if you search you will also find them in various types (mini bikini, panty etc.)  The best part is they show no panty line even under the tightest and whitest pants.  The down side is the micro fine elastic threads tend to pull out during washing (I don't take time to hand wash) but it doesn't seem to make a difference in their long term wear.  I have pairs that are three years old and doing just fine.",B00015HDVI
I used the sizing guide to purchase these and it seemed accurate & useful. I normally wear a Misses 6-7/Medium and the recommended size small in On Gossamer Women's Mesh Low-Rise Bikini (plain mesh) fit perfectly as they stretch to accommodate. I wash in machine on cold/delicate and air dry. These would be a good choice for travel as they air dry within 1-2 hours. If purchased again I would likely buy the plain mesh as I think it softer than the floral mesh in which I also found the size small a good choice but a little scatchy.,B00015HDVI
"These are odd panties.  The mesh is so light/thin that you have to place the panties flat over your rump and around your hips, etc.  (i.e you can't just pull them on and go.)  Once you have them placed they stay put and no panty lines.  The mesh either stretches or is just big because they seem too big in the mesh parts but fit OK with the elastic.  Also, if you don't place elastic just so, it will start cutting into your legs if you sit too long.  I won't purchase again.  I'm not sure if I should donate or toss.",B00015HDVI
I love these undies.  They are comfortable and cute.  My husband likes them.,B00015HDVI
"Very odd that the top half is a wee bit snugger than the bottom half of the undies. They're fine. I bought them accidentally, meaning to purchase the g-string, but am glad I opted to keep these in both Skin and Black. The line is mostly invisible from outside of clothing. Comfortable overall.",B00015HDVI
"These are great basic panties.  There is nothing really remarkable, and that's probably a good thing.  They are comfortable and do not show through clothing.",B00015HDVI
They were just what I was looking for to go with some bras I already had.  The fit was great and I will probably get them again.,B00015HDVI
"Amazing, whisper light, covers the bum, doesn't ride up.  Worth every penny.  I only wear these.  They are just like wearing nothing, great under white clothing",B00015HDVI
"These are flattering, well cut AND comfortable.  They don't reveal themselves with panty lines so are my go to for wearing under leggings.

And I don't know how they found a mesh fabric that doesn't snag and pull but my oldest pairs still look like new and they are over a decade old, and that's why I don't mind spending a bit more for them.",B00015HDVI
Comfortable and sheer. Feels nice to wear,B00015HDVI

"These are very nice, but not as silvery shiny as depicted, that's why I gave only 4 star's. I'm beginning to think that the good ol $7 and $10 pair's might be all that is really needed.",B0001GSYGA
Great and durable tights!  I love that they are 89% polymide!,B0001GSYGA
"She looks like dynamite in them and says they feel like silk, did not run after third trip out on town, and a trip out on town means a trip to the bedroom too ;-p Worth the $!",B0001GSYGA
Very nice and they feel wonderful,B0001GSYGA
"they are very nice and fit well, I've tried them in the bedroom and they are good to go, I don't know about outside wear.",B0001GSYGA
"Can't beat this quality, Falke is the best legwear ever. Worth the price, lasts forever.",B0001GSYGA
These are top of the line.  Can't find higher quality.,B0001GSYGA
"unbelievable quality and look, I love just putting them on and I intend to get more.",B0001GSYGA
"These look amazingly sexy and high-quality on a pair of supple, toned legs..",B0001GSYGA
"I am about as medium as one can get in terms of leg sizing.  While they did stay up initially, within 20 minutes they had fallen to around my ankles and there really is no graceful manner, that I can think of, to recover from a stocking faux pas in public.  They receive a solid one star rating for the simple fact that they don't ""Stay Up"".",B0001GSYGA
These look sexy on my wife. Nuff said.,B0001GSYGA
Very nice!~  silky  lace fits snug so I am not expecting it to fall down and be able to wear long hours.,B0001GSYGA
"These are fantastic! I have only tried them on, not yet worn them out and about. I was so pleased to finally find a brand of thigh highs that are nicely made, with lace that sits ON the thigh, not cuts into the thigh. They also are not skimpy in the height of the lace which is key to thigh highs sitting ON your thigh not cutting into your thigh. I was also pleased to find a brand that has more variety in the sizing since I am not overweight but have very long legs. Most of the cheap brands available in stores in the United States are flimsy and do not fit ON the thighs properly nor do they have sizing for women with long legs.

I used to buy Victoria's Secret thigh highs (the only brand I was ever able to find in the U.S. that had a size that fit long legs) but they have stopped producing them. These look to be even better quality than the VS brand. I am very happy. Because these look to be better quality, I suspect they will have a longer life than the VS brand (each VS pair used to last approximately one year and I am a woman who wears dresses and thigh highs almost every day)!

I bought size Large, am 5'6"", my legs are a 32"" inseam and I typically wear a size 8 or a 6. I am a cyclist so I'd say my thighs are slightly more muscular than average, but not to any extreme.",B0001GSYGA
"Take this with a grain of salt...these stay-ups fit like a dream and are made really well but I just didn't expect them to be SO shiny. I mean, they say ""Shine"" so it's my bad I guess but who wears hosiery like this??? I could join the Ice Capades. It's a little odd.",B0001GSYGA
"Love, love, love these socks!!!!!  I was visiting Europe this past Spring and it was colder than I had anticipated.  We decided a visit to Harrod's was in order.  I found these in the hosiery department.  They were a bit expensive but to be honest they were one of the lowest price pair of socks I could find there that met my needs.  I wanted ankle length black.  I am so glad I purchased them.  For a thin pair of socks they were warm and very comfortable.  I wanted to wash them every night to wear every day.  Once I got home I felt the same way so I decided I just had to see if I could purchase more.  Luckily I found them on Amazon so I purchased two more pair.  I wear them with leggings and the cross over from the bottom of the legging to the sock is almost invisible.  They are so comfortable and don't shrink when washed.  After 6 months my first pair still fit like new.  I wear them for exercise class and also for every day.  Because they are thin I can wear them with almost any shoe.  They were expensive but oh so worth it!",B0001GSYVA
Wonderful socks!  I now have 4 pair and will continue to build the collection.  Comfortable and easy to care for.,B0001GSYVA
"Expensive, but worth it if you have problem feet or skin.  Most sock sizes are a bit baggy for my size 7 feet, but not these - no bunching up.  They do not bind at the top either.",B0001GSYVA
"Falke offers 100 percent cotton socks.
They never fade, no tight elastic at top and for me they feel great!!
I've worn them for years.",B0001GSYVA
"Thicker than the Fallkes I prefer, would like better descriptions on their site.",B0001GSYVA
"I first bought these socks while on a business trip in Europe many years ago because I had a sock emergency.  Don't you hate those?

I now have several pair that I wear 4 of 5 days to work with loafer style shoes.  Each pair lasts a few years which is great and the best part is the top band.  It's elastic, but never so tight that you end up with band digging into your calf during the day.  They also have a distinct Left and Right sock, so the fit is perfect and you never have extra sock squishing your pinkie toes.",B0001GSYVA
"These are expensive, but I LOVE these socks. The writing is on the inside of the arch towards the other foot, so it is easy for me with my poor eyesight to tell right from left. They do not bother my toes in the least, and they stay in place. I've had these for 9 months and they are holding up great.",B0001GSYVA
"I love these socks. A bit pricey, but worth it. Pure luxury. The fit is perfect. Also pretty cool getting a parcel vial Royal Mail.",B0001GSYVA
These have a slight green tint but are very comfortable.,B0001GSYVA
great Christmas gift. My wife loves these socks,B0001GSYVA
"Great cotton socks (love cotton!), but the awesome thing about these socks is that there's an ""L"" and ""R"" at the toe of each sock to indicate to which foot they belong.  It's a cute, thoughtful touch that I've not seen before.  Utterly awesome.",B0001GSYVA
"Very nice quality socks, just right thickness.",B0001GSYVA
Very comfortable.  Just the right thickness for certain fashion sneakers I wear.  I really like them a lot.,B0001GSYP6
Wonderful quality. Worth the price! Loved them so much that I purchased more!,B0001GSYP6
"I am 71 years old and wear a size 5 shoe.  I have not had socks that fit since I was in 6th grade.  These are perfect.  I feel like Cinderella:  not to thick, not too thin, just the right length to wear with slacks, soft and a bit cushiony.  Pricey but worth every penny!",B0001GSYP6
Falke makes great socks. These are perfect fit and wash up nicely.,B0001GSYP6
They are a little longer then I would have liked.,B0001GSYP6
"Very good quality, fit as expected, arrived quickly.  Will order again.",B0001GSYP6
"poor quality, would not buy again",B0001HK6JW
So far so good. VERY thick and they fit quite well. Have yet to use them on the ice as they are for a show later next month.,B0001HK6JW
"Fit as expected and soft. They are not, however, warm.",B0001HK6JW
"Good product for the price.  My daughter is figure skater, and these are perfect.  Product runs small, so order a size up for a good fit.",B0001HK6JW
"My daughter wears these for practice almost every day, she loves wearing skirts or shorts for practice. These tights are thick and warm and don't break as easy as other models do.",B0001HK6JW
"These are the best over the boot tights I have found so far.  They fit perfectly, have elastic around the bottom that keeps the tight over the boot and in place, they are thick and durable and a good color for my skin tone.  I bought all the pairs they had on hand.  Please get more.",B0001HK6JW
These are awesome skating tights!!,B0001HK6JW
Fit perfectly. Arrived really fast too.,B0001HK6JW
Keeps my daughter warm during practice.,B0001HK6JW
"Not overly thick, but they seem like they will hold up to skating use better than nylons.",B0001HK6JW
"The texture is soft, warm and comfortable under my skating pants, but the ladies size small is too tight in the waist. I'm 4'-9"" tall, 98 lbs, but sometimes my waist expands to 28"" and that makes the ""ladies small"" way too tight. I'm ordering a new pair in size medium.",B0001HK6JW
"Slow returns process, the bra seemed well made, simply too large. Nice color, nice lace. Hope return is processed soon!",B0001HKKQQ
"I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it. I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out. Sadly, it was not to be.

In fairness, I ordered a bra that was too big, simply because I really didn't know what was going to work. After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes, I can say that I am probably a 42J (US measurement). Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.

Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered, this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable. The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.

The straps are useless. This bra is made as though it's for a linebacker. Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders. I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly. I'm a medium to large frame, my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches, and this bra's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.

I suspect this bra may run a little bit large, compared to others. The cups are outrageously large, and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not. The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it. Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top, rather than underneath. It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement, since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.

This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased. The material seems a bit more flimsy.

Overall it is not a bra I would order again. I won't return it, but it won't be a bra I wear often. It will probably be my laundry day bra.",B0001HKKQQ
"This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing. Many bra makers make ""fashion"" bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup. Well, they don't work. I'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup. Didn't even begin to come close to the right cup size. My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me---fit perfectly! She looked great in this bra. Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes (C and up) but are not.  Bali is true to sizing for me, but everyone is different. This one is being returned.",B0001HKKQQ
Remember Madonna's early 90's look?  Not very flattering.  I felt like I had ice cream cones on!  I will be returning this product.,B0001HKKQQ
"This fits perfectly and looks pretty. The price is really attractive too, for this quality bra I usually have to pay twice as much. Highly recommend this, especially for a fuller figured woman.",B0001HKKQQ
"Excellent construction and fit, very durable and supportive.  Will be purchasing another and will also take a closer look at this lingerie brand.",B0001HKKQQ
I ordered the 40 F and it fits great.  It is very supportive and I love that it fits snugly to my chest.  This will be my everyday bra.,B0001HKKQQ
"Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers (34 G), but this one was way too small.  Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan.",B0001HKKQQ
"This bra runs big - and I've wound up returning it twice just to figure out what size I wear. It's pretty, and well made - but the cup is sized for someone with more tissue at the top of the breast rather than underneath.",B0001HKKQQ
This is a wonderful bra for ladies with large breasts.  It is the best I have ever had and lasts longer than three weeks!  It holds up very well after going through the washing machine and has solid straps.,B0001HKKQQ
Love my Tango bra's!  Is the only one I've ever found for my 44HH's that don't have the football effect.  Beautiful and comfortable!,B0001HKKQQ
I like it but it is a little loose. They usually make them to size. I think I just need to order a different size.,B0001HKKQQ
"I prefer the black one for day to day but with a white shirt I needed an alternative, don't love the color but this brand and this tango superbra bra is the only one I use I have been buying it for maybe 10 years now. I'm a 32-34F and it's a hard size to find  bra for.",B0001HKKQQ
"I like the way this bra felt, but I had to return it due to it was a little smaller for me than expected.  I do plan on purchasing a different size since they do fit better than the ones I have bought in the stores by other manufactures.",B0001HKKQQ
I wear a size 38E and this bra is super comfy!,B0001HKKQQ
I've been wearing his bras for about 5 years and I love it.  It lasts forever without the wires popping through.,B0001HKKQQ
"i got this in a 32F. i have been so relieved to find the panache/cleo brand bras and like almost all in their line, this bra offers comfortable, flattering support for my very large breasts. my breasts are wide-set on my chest and this bra finds a balance where it sort of guides them front & center where i prefer them but without the wire pinching or digging into me. i often have the problem where even in a bra that fits otherwise, my breasts tend to ""pop up"" out of the top a bit and create that unflattering double-boob look, and when the straps are adjusted correctly, this bra doesnt do that. it is fuller coverage which works great even under tank tops, and i can wear it for long, sweaty hours without it shifting around too much or sort of losing its shape. in fact, i have sort of abused this bra by wearing it sometimes 18 hours straight almost every day for several months, only alternating occasionally with another cleo, and it has held up quite well. it costs more than the target bras but it is a world of difference in comfort, fit, and profile for anyones body, but most especially for women with very large breasts. when this one gives out ill likely buy three identical replacements.",B0001HKKQQ
"I really love this bra but it's another that didn't work for me for being too big in the top of the cup.  Sizing down a cup size did not help at all unfortunately, it's just one that's probably better for more perky breasts - not mine.
It's beautifully made and I really wish it would have fit me.",B0001HKKQQ
Great fit and support. Now my back doesn't hurt that much.,B0001HKKQQ
Well made bra with a true to size fit.  I will purchase again.,B0001HKKQQ
Fits perfectly.  Hard to find this size and I hate to order and have things not fit correctly.  So happy with this.,B0001HKKQQ
Met ever expectation I have. I think this is the best Bra I have ever worn in my 70 years. I love it!!!!,B0001HKKQQ
I truly love this bra - I am a 36DD - This is my second purchase of it - wore the first one to death - bought another one and also just now bought the black one.,B0001HKKQQ
"Unfortunately, this bra is extremely uncomfortable.  The underwire in the middle comes up much too high and digs/rubs into my chest, which leaves marks.",B0001HKKQQ
Test bra.  Hard to find good ones in my size.  Love it.,B0001HKKQQ
This is my favorite bra and I have been buying for years.,B0001HKKQQ
"The band fit, but the cup does not and I have other bras from the same manufacturer in the same size and they fit perfectly.  Disappointed, but the brand is quite good, it is just this particular bra.",B0001HKKQQ
"This one didn't work for me. I ordered a 36FF, US size 36H, but found there to be a gap up top, which has never happened to me. The material is scratchy and the seams create the classic cone shape. Not for me.",B0001HKKQQ
Great supportive bra. Very well made and beautifully detailed. I wear this bra when I need extra support for a tighter shirt.,B0001HKKQQ
This bra is pretty and supportive.  Everything a larger chested girl could ask for.,B0001HKKQQ
"This would be better for women with somewhat more upper fullness; I didn't have enough with a pendulous, full on bottom, 2/5 shape, and the cups were wrinkly and looked horrible under clothing.",B0001HKKQQ
the fit was a bit small. the lace is also very raised and can be seen through a regular tshirt. this should be a sweater bra.,B0001HKKQQ
"once again, on my adventure to find a bra that fits, ordered this one out of an interest and wanted to give a chance to a brand i have not tried before. after trying this one out, i would try this model again, when i'm about two sizes smaller. ordered size 34e - when i first picked it up, it seemed very light and kind of see through, so you can tell that it's thin. it has 2 hook closure so, as you can imagine, the band is somewhat ""thin"" - i could almost feel it digging into my skin; straps seem sturdy, with light padding but also thin - for me personaly straps alone would cause shoulder and back pain in a couple hours; cups are made of thin see through material, but seem sturdy. the cup was actualy big enough to contain me, the shape of the cup was somewhat unatractive - they looked like cones, which was rather disturbing to me and awkward. had to send it back.",B0001HKKQQ
Beautiful product but runs very small.,B0001HKKQQ
"I love the fit and feel of this bra! As someone with a pretty large bust, it's hard to find something comfortable that supports and is also pretty. Just beware that it is in UK sizes so you need to convert.",B0001HKKQQ
"Makes my body look great, but the fit is a bit uncomfortable, especially between the breasts.",B0001HKKQQ
I am very happy with this product.  I have been using this brand for many years and find it the most comfortable and always fits just right,B0001HKKQQ
I'm a 32DD and the band is a little tighter than the usual ones I have. Plus the lace on the cups make my nipples really itchy. Quite disappointing for a Panache product.,B0001HKKQQ
"If you are looking for a pointy boob 1980's Madonna ( I love her don't' get me wrong) shape, then this is the bra for you! I am usually a fan of t shirt molded bras, but wanted to try a seamed bra. This is not for me, it gives a VERY pointed shape across that diagonal seam, a very unattractive side profile. Sad, as it comes in soo many fun colors. This is going back.",B0001HKKQQ
"I love Panache bras! As a rather large chested woman, it is hard to find bras that are truly supportive without giving the cone Madonna look. This bra is a great find!",B0001HKKQQ
I love my swim top.  It's perfect for me. I recommend this Product because it is made with a high quality fabric.  My size is 32 F and my contries doesn't have this size and when I put on my first brassier and swim top I fell very very happy . I congratulate panache. I think they are The best,B0001HKKQQ
"Six years ago I was wearing a 34C until I went into Bravassimo and was professionally fitted into a 32E. MY LIFE CHANGED. They put me in this bra and it was the most comfortable thing I'd ever worn. No digging bone, no aching shoulders, it was great. Even though I've shrunk since then, I still wear this bra in my updated size. I highly recommend it.",B0001HKKQQ
This bra is a breath of fresh air! I had been squeezing into o 40h from Lame Bryant (sp intended). It was terrible post 16mos of bfing. My boobs look great!,B0001HKKQQ
This fit horribly. I filled out the bottoms of the bra fine but there was a ton of extra fabric over the top of my breasts. I would normally say I should size down but the top of the bra cups bit into the top of my breasts.  All around just bad for me.  I am pretty bummed out because the reviews made it seen great.  This will be returned.,B0001HKKQQ
does not fit as expected. I will be returning it,B0001HKKQQ
Excellent.  I purchase this bra whenever available.  I only wish it came in white.,B0001HKKQQ
"For me personally, it fit a little bit larger-I could have gone with an F cup instead of a G. I find that there's a little extra fabric right in the center at the seam because it is very slightly on the pointier side, especially if your breasts are really round and just won't fill out that little tiny bit at the apex. I do wish the sides were taller and fail to understand why these large sizes keep getting made with such small sides and backs. It does provide support, but if you have any sort of chubby back going on, it will puff out over this tiny band.",B0001HKKQQ
"Quality bra for well endowed girls.  I don't think any bra over a certain size is 100% comfortable after a certain size, but this one does a good job. It is quality material, holds up well and controls the girls. I've been wearing these bras for over ten years and definitely wouldn't be coming back if they didn't work well. These bras last me about a year to a year and a half with hand washing and rotating them with other bras.  The underwires do tend to poke out but they are easy to repair.  I recommend this and the Panache brand to any girl.",B0001HKKQQ
"This bra lifts you up and forward. Looks nice under clothes, other than lace is not super smooth under tops.",B0001HKKQQ
"I was surprised that this bra was unlined since the product description never really alluded to it. While the bra fits (something hard to find for a 30FF), it makes your boobs look awkwardly pointy under clothes and doesn't give the coverage I was really looking for, being that it's unlined. Would not recommend this as an every day bra and definitely not as a T-shirt bra.",B0001HKKQQ
"I love this bra, best fit ever!",B0001HKKQQ
"Sturdy well built bra, if you're okay with a bra that has no lining and fits large, than this is the bra for you.  You can tell it is high quality material, however, it didn't fit me.  I'm usually a F32, this bra was a little baggy in the cup area, most are a little snug in this size.  I returned the bra and went with a Freya, which happened to fit a little small in the F32 - so if you're thinking about your regular bra size for this bra I would recommend going a cup size smaller!",B0001HKKQQ
I wanted to love this bra but it just isn't the one for me.  I have the straps as tight as possible and they slip off my shoulders.  The band fits perfectly but yet I managed to put my finger through the fabric when putting it on.  Slightly disappointed in the quality of the material used.,B0001HKKQQ
"My wife ordered this bra because of good reviews.  It was pretty and she liked the fabric's feel.  She found it to be too small for the size, too wide set in the middle, and too pointy in shape so she returned it to get something else.",B0001HKKQQ
"Is it possible to be in love with a bra? The fit was as expected, it fit me like a glove. :) I love how it's supportive and comfortable yet sexy all at the same time. I think this one has become my new favorite!",B0001HKKQQ
I continue to order this bra over and over again. I love the fit and they way it makes me look.,B0001HKKQQ
I bought this before and knew how well it fitted.  So I am back again.  Would recommend this bra.,B0001HKKQQ
Would have loved it if it was padded.,B0001HKKQQ
Top of the bra is at your neck! You can't wear this with anything other than a collared shirt or high neck. Otherwise people can see your bra above your shirt. And it's cheap fabric.,B0001HKKQQ
Amazing!! I sent the link of this bra to all my friends with DD bra finding problem. Love this!!!,B0001HKKQQ
"I gave this bra 2 stars even though it fit as expected, because the shape of the bra was not flattering, and it doesn't look great under clothes. It makes my breasts look smaller and flatter and I don't like that.",B0001HKKQQ
I like the fit of this bra but the straps stretch and I prefer non-stretch straps.,B0001HKKQQ
"I was very excited when I first saw that this bra was on sale because I have other Panache bras, but I was sadly disappointed upon receiving it. I did not realize that the material is sheer and the embroidered pattern is easily seen through thin shirts. I have to say that it is a very comfortable bra and my 34 F fit true to size. My main issue is the odd shape it gave my chest, I felt like I had pointy torpedo breasts. Although this is a comfortable bra I would never wear it out of the house due to the awkward shape, but if you don't mind the shape I would recommend this bra for comfort.",B0001HKKQQ
"Good fitting, non-padded bra.  I get so tired of wearing 1/8"" thick padded foam bras all the time!  Even tho this one isn't very smooth due to the pattern of the material, I've worn it under a tight t-shirt with an spaghetti strap undershirt and it does just fine.  I will end up getting some smoother non-padded bras as well now that I've seen how much more comfortable this fairly inexpensive non-padded bra is.",B0001HKKQQ
I returned this bra not because it fit poorly but because it fit a little like the Madonna bullet bra. That is not the look I was going for.,B0001HKKQQ
"great bra for bigger boobs, holds them up better than any bra I have ever purchased  love love it",B0001HKKQQ
I have worn this bra style for a few years.  In my old ones it took a couple of years to have underwire issues but I just ordered 2 of these about 2 months ago and already the underwire is breaking through the top of the cup in the middle.,B0001HKKQQ
Apparently this line of bras runs small as I wear a 38 DD in many other lines - loved the looks but not the fit,B0001HKKQQ
the lace and the underwire bite in my skin badly and it is horrible see thru you cant wear it unless you want your nipple on display,B0001HKKQQ
Ran too small and was too stiff. Also not ok if u don't want the pointy matronly look,B0001HKKQQ
Fits as expected but material is different than previous identical bra which makes me believe this may be a knock off version.,B0001HKKQQ
"if you are a big breast girl like me and you need some seriously lift and a gorgeous bra, please, go to CURVY KATE! it will cost you more, but the quality of their products will never let you down!",B0001HKKQQ
"I have found the right size for me in a Panache, and tend to buy this same style constantly.  After a reduction from an HH to something in a DDD/F size, this still fits very well.  I've been very happy with how the bra holds up over time as well.",B0001HKKQQ
"This is the best bra. Looks great under clothing, keeps the girls in check, and looks a lot sexier in person than it does in this picture. I am going back for a few more colors.",B0001HKKQQ
It seems like one side was a lot bigger then the other side. I wouldn't buy again! Was a waste of money,B0001HKKQQ
The wife said the Panache bra was the best fit of any bras she has tried. Will order more in different colors.,B0001HKKQQ
"I started wearing these bras after getting a proper fitting at Linda's in NYC a couple of years ago.  They were charging $55 each, and I was thrilled when I was able to find them on Amazon at a better price.",B0001HKKQQ
"This bra is decent, especially for the price. I always wear a 34G and this was a little bit too big. It's very noticeable under shirts as well, but a smaller size probably would have fit better.

The one thing I really dislike, and the reason why I'm sending it back, is that the underwire practically reaches my throat! I mean, that's an exaggeration, but the underwire is hardcore and very uncomfortable. Maybe a smaller size would have been better.",B0001HKKQQ
It was exactly what I expected. Perfect fit. I which I could have got it in white but it was not available in my size ~ but overall great!!,B0001HKKQQ
"The band on this bra was perfect, but the seaming on the cups didn't fit quite right.  It bunched up a little near the middle, but not enough that a smaller cup size would have fit.  I think this is probably a great bra for some people, but just didn't fit me right.",B0001HKKQQ
"I really like this bra for normal use under light-colored tops. Since it is a balconette, I do not wear it when I am babysitting because the leaning over and up does cause some jostling and minimal muffin top. However, great for most days and I feel pretty wearing it!",B0001HKKQQ
"Comfortable, well fitting, supportive, and pretty.
It is everything a larger busted girl needs though the embroidery can show through lighter weight tops.",B0001HKKQQ
"I LOVE this bra, and have already ordered one in another color. The cups hold my girls in with no spillage, and the band is very comfortable. It's really cute, too! Highly recommend.",B0001HKKQQ
"The fabric this is made out of isn't the most comfortable, it's a stiff, shear fabric. I didn't realize it was shear when I bought it, but it fits me fine.",B0001HKKQQ
"When i purchased this bra, I didn't realize it was in UK sizes!?!? So it's unfortunately too small but I will be updating this review once i receive the next size.",B0001HKKQQ
My mom loved this bra as it fit well and offered great support.,B0001HKKQQ
"The design shows through clothes, not a t-shirt bra by any means. Also, the cups are not stretchy, so only purchase if you have no difference in breast size.",B0001HKKQQ
"I have always wanted to find a bra that fit...I wear a 40 H, I went to a shop in town and got fitted best thing I ever did, this is the bra I purchased for $54 then I found it here way cheaper.  It is comfortable, and it holds up the breast at the band NOT the shoulders...I now have 4",B0001HKKQQ
"I can't wait to get another one of this bra. It's the best bra...boobs stay in place, fits well...and then some. Well worth it.",B0001HKKQQ
"The material seem quite sturdy and strong, nice bra but the Cups are too big. Will buy another though! ...",B0001HKKQQ
"The bra is wonderful. Quality is great and it's very well constructed. That being said, it is a little scratchy and I had to return it because it does not work for my full on bottom breasts. There was a lot of wrinkling and gapping at the top.

I ordered Cleo Lucy 32G instead and the cups are perfect.",B0001HKKQQ
"This is a very nice bra and provides great support, but the shape does not work for my body. I have wide rooted breasts that start at my underarms. Therefore i need wide underwires so that i don't get stabbed in the armpit and have awful sideboob. This would work for someone with less body fat, or breasts with narrower roots than mine. I had to go with Elomi and Goddess brand as those are shaped better for plus size women.",B0001HKKQQ
"This fit quite snugly, but the width of the straps makes it tolerably comfortable. I did not expect the bra to be so sheer, but that is probably my own fault for not reading the description thoroughly. This is not the type of bra that should be worn with most articles of clothing as the embellishment can be made out easily through the fabric of your clothing, for these reasons I count myself as having an overall neutral opinion on it.",B0001HKKQQ
"I was wearing the wrong size, not wanting to really admit they had gotten bigger. I followed the modern measuring guide on Wiki [...]  (method 2) and discovered my old bras were 2 cup sizes to small - no wonder they never fit up against my breast plate.  I bought the 40GG (US size 40J) after measuring myself: under bust 40"" torso 50"".

After I put this bra on I just went through the initial shock of how good it feels to have something that fits right. After wearing it for a few hours I noticed:
1. I have cleavage with it when I'm sitting down but not when I'm standing like the model. For larger busted women maybe the picture is misleading it definitely isn't a push up bra, but I wasn't looking for one.
2. Don't expect to wear this bra with super thin material the flower embroidery will show through. T-shirt material is fine with it.
3. For larger busted girls the underwire is quite tall, I could see this being a problem for someone with a shorter torso. (I'm 5'5"")
4. This bra's straps are set a little wide, it didn't bother me to much but I don't have narrow shoulders.
5. In this bra my posture seems better which is really nice!
6. Overall this bra seems to be a great value, and quite comfortable. I feel really lucky that it works so well after taking a shot in the dark with the modern sizing guide.",B0001HKKQQ
"Love this bra! Can't say how nice it is to find a bra that provides support for a larger chest on an otherwise small woman without feeling like you're wearing another shirt. This is my 3rd one of these bras and I not only love them, but have told several of my friends about them as well.",B0001HKKQQ
The fabric was stiff and scratchy.  The band was a little small and the cups were way too small and cut into my breasts making ugly bulges.  I ordered two other bras at the same time (same size but a different brand) and those fit great.,B0001HKKQQ
This product and others like it need a better warning for UK sizing. The bra material was good though. Good bra.,B0001HKKQQ
Perfect fit the girls are up and separated. I will buy more. The price was great. I have paid as much at $68.00 for this same bra. I will purchase again. The right price and fit.,B0001HKKQQ
"Great bra, fits great and comfortable. It looks great under clothes and sits low so you can wear tops that hang a bit lower. It is my favorite!",B0001HKKQQ
This is a very comfortable bra...have worn this brand and style for years. Glad to have found it on Amazon.,B0001HKKQQ
"I am constantly stabbed in the right arm pit with this bra, the tops of the cups are just a little too loose, but the rest fits fine. The feel/texture of it against my skin is fine, and does not bother me, but besides that I hate wearing this bra, but because I am a 38G it's hard to find bras that fit properly so I'm at a loss until I can find another bra.",B0001HKKQQ
"This bra fits great and provides full coverage, support, and a natural shape.  Sadly it is rather painful to wear especially in the under arm area.",B0001HKKQQ
"I have another Panache bra that i like much better. This one is a little too narrow even though I ordered my normal size in 34DD, giving me the back fat spillage I hate.  It makes my breasts look full versus lifted/separated, which is what I was going for (what my other Panache bra did). But it is very well-made, great construction.",B0001HKKQQ
"i didn't realize this was in UK sizing.  it is also a sheer bra, keep that in mind.  i didn't realize from the photo that it was a sheer bra. it is also not a foam cup bra which is what i really wanted. it was pretty thought and might look nice if it fit. my fault as i didn't notice the Uk sizing. sent it back. will try again!",B0001HKKQQ
"Took some trial and error to get the right fit. 40F was too tight at band but great fit in cup. 44F was good fit at band but loose at the top part of the cup. 42F fit just fine! Has really great support and truly lifts and separates (no uniboob). Some may think the shape is too bullet-like, but I think it depends upon fullness. For plus-size women it's good to bring the boobs up more to help define shape from rest of the body! The fabric is not soft but not that itchy. The pattern does show through so not a good t-shirt bra.",B0001HKKQQ
"I normally wear a 40G (UK) in other brands, so I figured I'd go with the same size with my first Panache bra.  The band was a little tight, but not constricting.  The cups were much larger than I anticipated.  Unfortunately had to return and couldn't reorder because the size I needed wasn't in stock.  Was sad to see it go - it's such a cute bra!",B0001HKKQQ
"I was very excited to find a bra in this size- its often hard for me to find a bra.  The middle wires go up too high on my body- its a great fit through the cup, but since the middle wires go up, it often digs into my check.  The fabric itches my skin there as well.  I can not wear the bra any longer.",B0001HKKQQ
"I returned this bra since it didn't fit very well.  Also, the material was a bit scratchy for my taste.",B0001HKKQQ
"This bra was too pointy for my chest -- empty fabric actually stuck out away from my body in a point at the tip of each cup. The bra definitely wasn't too big, because at the same time there was a little overflow at the top. What a weird fit. It's a pretty bra, but not the right shape for me.",B0001HKKQQ
My favorite bra and just needing to replenish!  I have worn this particular tango for years and a must have!,B0001HKKQQ
"It is scratchy but I haven't washed it yet. I am not looking forward to wearing it again because the underwire pokes me under my arms. I have a short torso so it would probably not poke everyone.
It looks nice and seems well made. My husband likes it and that does count for something.
The band seems a little looser than i expected it to be but not to bad.",B0001HKKQQ
Ended up returning this. Love the Panache brand though. This bra is actually quite flimsy in build. The fabric is a lot more meshy than I thought.,B0001HKKQQ
"This bra is fabulous. This bra is strong and brave and doesn't quit.  You know how some bras are great the first day you wear them and never the same again? Not this one. This one takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Even with boob sweat and long bike rides. Even when you accidentally throw it in the dryer, which is probably not recommended but I wouldn't know because I never read the instructions.

If your boobs clap when you run up the stairs, this is the bra for you.  Added benefit: it isn't ugly. It is prettier in person.",B0001HKKQQ
So after several fittings I knew they would fit. They are wonderful and not 'battleax-y'. Panache always makes great bras.,B0001HKKQQ
"Great bra, inexpensive, and it has a lot to support (36G). I'm used to spending $85+ for my bras. It was very nice to not have to this time.",B0001HKKQQ
"the fit is perfectly true to size. they last well. I buy them for the support. i have several. What does annoy me is the ""Lost leader"" price they put on the bra. No matter what color, it is always more expensive in my size.",B0001HKKQQ
"This is the only bra I have found that fits, lifts, and is comfortable enough to wear all day. Thanks.",B0001HKKQQ
Love it!  I want pink or navy  with matching panties.  Love the price and the support.  Very happy it only has two clasps to fasten. This makes it more appealing for any age.  Very unlike the old four clasps  unattractive but much needed bra you wore just for the fit!,B0001HKKQQ
"This is the first bra that has EVER fit right for me (I've been buying the wrong size and I finally got things right). This bra is inexpensive enough that poor college student me can buy it, but it's SUCH nice quality and I feel a bit sexy. The only complaint is that the center part digs into my chest and it irritated the skin in between my boobs for the first few weeks, but it's gotten better with wear. I'm definitely going to keep buying more!",B0001HKKQQ
"This bra is comfortable and gives nice support but my boobs look so pointed!  Its a shape I have never had a problem with in any other bra.  They look fine from the front but when I turn sideways they look like a torpedo. That said, I still wear it because it is so supportive (I am a 30F) and comfortable.  If it gave me a more natural shape I'd give it 5 stars.",B0001HKKQQ
"This is the only item so far I've ever had to return to Amazon. The fit was big in the cups on top, not a problem I've ever experienced before. My other Panache bras I love. I bought this one because it was on my recommended list after taking a survey on Her Room to find the best bra for me. I do recommend doing this on their website for larger busted girls. It really helped me. My husband always told me he liked me in balcony bras better, and guess what....that was the number one bra recommended for me. This one just didn't work for me. Very awkward fit. I will have to say returning items to Amazon is easy and hassle free. The Panache Chloe Sasha bra is wonderful alternative to this bra if you want a true balcony fit.",B0001HKKQQ
I've had this brand before so I knew it would be a good buy.  I am what some ppl might consider heavy chested (38G/H) and its important to me to have well supported bra.  I don't believe you can go wrong with this one!!,B0001HKKQQ
"I had a bra-fitting at a local boutique.  Panache bras fit like custom-made bras.  I wear a 32F and have large breast, narrow rib cage and shallow chest, so that is no small feat.  Gone are the days of the mono-boob as the Tango II (and other Superbras by Panache), lift and separate and give you a perky profile all without the dreaded molded cup.  Keep in mind, this bra is made of thin fabric and if you have nipple-phobia, you will have to buy some ""petals"" to conceal them.",B0001HKKQQ
"My only issue with this bra would be that the design/embroidery sometimes show through lighter materials. Otherwise, I am very pleased with this purchase. In fact, I have 2 of them.",B0001HKKQQ
"Very supportive, flattering and light weight (for this 36D).  I needed something hand-washable for travel to a humid, tropical region.  I've worn this a few times to try it out, and I think it will work out well for summer and/or travel.
I would give it 5 stars, but the raised leaf pattern will show through a tight or thin top.  I would buy another one or two, if they made one with no raised pattern.",B0001HKKQQ
"The fit was perfect.  Measured according to a tutorial found online, and bought as a trial.  I didn't have to go up any in the band size like other reviewers did.  I do find the fabric to be a little less comfortable than expected.  It isn't bad for the price though.  I ended up ordering two slightly more expensive bras from another company on amazon so that I could increase the comfort factor.",B0001HKKQQ
Great bra. Fit cut style are all as I expected. I just wish is was a bit smoother and the straps a tiny bit wider. Other then that I'm going to buy another one if they have them in different colors.,B0001HKKQQ
"I Absolutely love this bra! It fits perfectly. The cups are not too shallow, so the wire meets the breastbone the way it is supposed to! I will be trying more Panache products!",B0001HKKQQ
I have difficulty finding supportive bras that contain my 36Fs.  This fit the bill and didn't make me pointy or flat like some of the other brands do. Pretty also.,B0001HKKQQ
"I love this bra, buying two more in a different color. It's nice to have a well made bra that fits.",B0001HKKQQ
I loved the Penache Daisy bra which isn't made anymore.  This is not similar.  Looks a bit like it but the fit is so small and the material is far to sheer. Sentit back.,B0001HKKQQ
The support is awesome. Comfortable after you wear it a couple times. Seems well made. Well worth the money! Shapes as well on the sides,B0001HKKQQ
"This is a difficult size to find in a store,so I turned to the internet. Despite being unable to try it on before buying,it fits perfectly,very comfortable,and quite supportive. I read many reviews before purchasing,and all were positive. . I have found that Panache bras in general are true to size,well-fitting and supportive. My favorite so far has been their Cleo Natasha. If it had come in nude,I would have bought it,but it only comes in a print. That is my only quibble with Panache,that their bras are not all available in black and nude as well as fashiony colors.
 Altogether,I am very pleased with this bra. I will definitely buy more of Panache's bras;they are a good value for the price.",B0001HKKQQ
"I wear a 36G and it's always been really difficult for me to find bras that fit and support. This bra accomplishes both! And you don't have to look like you're wearing your grandmother's crocheted doilies! I took off one star only because after a long day of wear, the underwire can sort of chafe your armpits a little bit. But this happens with a lot of bras at the end of the day. If you have a bigger chest, then it just sort of comes with the territory! And unlike other balconette bras, this one is actually fashioned to fit a bigger chest. No more squishing out of the top of your bra! A definite must have for anyone in the ""boobs have their own orbit"" category like myself!",B0001HKKQQ
"Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F, this is the only one that actually fit. Unfortunately, the look was totally unflattering. It made my chest look like two squished cones. Had to return.",B0001HKKQQ
"I love that Panache bras come in the truly wide variety of sizes. After years of making due with bras that I could buy in department stores, I finally decided to take a chance and order a bra that is my true size (34 FF). And what a nice change it makes! Also, the bra is well-made and pretty. I especially like that it does not have molded foam cups. It is light-weight and somewhat sheer. I have already ordered another.",B0001HKKQQ
"I'd love the bra if only it had fit. I bought an 38F, which should be my size. This lovely bra fit in the back. The lift is great. I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup.",B0001HKKQQ
The bra is very nice and pretty.  The fabric is stiff and rather itchy until it is washed a few times.,B0001HKKQQ
"Very rarely can I find a cleavage enhancing bra that I don't literally spill out of. . This bra gives a decent amount of equal support and lift for a big busted and small girl. Those of you in the same boat get me. Although I'm big busted I'm not a big fan of minimizing granny bras and this one is pretty. The only thing I might change for a tad more support is a little bit wider straps for more support, otherwise it's awesome.",B0001HKKQQ
This bra is terrific.  It's the perfect bra for the full coverage and no spill over.  I only wish they would make this bra in a solid material and then perfect would be the onlly word!,B0001HKKQQ
"If have ever had any fit issues, you should really measure yourself and order this bra. Super supportive and every size imaginable available. I recommended it to all my girlfriends and we all wear them now.",B0001HKKQQ
"This has wide wires, which are great for me but are not for everyone, just FYI.  However, I found this bra SO comfy and didn't want to take it off at the end fo the day!",B0001HKKQQ
I love Panache and I love this style.  I have several of these.  They give you that separation along with a good lift.  I am a 34F in this one and this bra works wonders!  Comfy and attractive.  Works well with low cut blouses.,B0001HKKQQ
"Unfortunately, the central gores are a little too high and rub on my breastbone. The underwires also tend to poke me under the arms, but I have a very short torso. I do wear the bra when I need excellent support, but I much prefer the Freya Deco.",B0001HKKQQ
"great fit, great support, very awesome. Totally recommend. Only drawback is that it might separate the girls a little too much with certain styles of shirt.",B0001HKKQQ
"This is a nicely constructed bra. The best part is the thin straps and sexier appearance than most large bras. I have gained quite a bit of weight since having my last child and have thus found these to not be as comfortable for me anymore. The top of the underwire digs into my underarms and hurts. If you have a large cup size and a small frame with not very much side tissue, then this would be the perfect bra. Having a large frame (unfortunately) and a large cup size, I find the Elomi bra to be a better fit. Panache makes absolutely beatiful bras, though. Also, in terms of construction, I don't think these are quite as sturdy or well made as Elomi.",B0001HKKQQ
I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras.  I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size.  I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette.  This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette.  The bra fit was horrible.  It gave my breasts a horrible shape.  I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal.  The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras.  The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart.  The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts.  I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness.  The cups pucker at the top.  They do not lay flush with breast. I would definitely not reccomend this bra.  If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge.  It is a much better fit.,B0001HKKQQ
"I really wanted to like this bra because it was a great price on Amazon, but it just gave me a really weird shape under my clothes; pointier and lower than I like my bustline. I also thought the band was a little looser than I like. The embroidery was also very apparent under even loose t-shirts, and the seams had some puckering issues around the 'point.' Returned, back to my favorite brand of Fantasie.",B0001HKKQQ
I ordered this bra for a second time!  There are lots of reviews that say it is very uncomfortable and yes it can be.  I make sure to wash it with Downy or it chafes horribly!  I let it air dry and it's good to go.,B0001HKKQQ
"wouldn't order this bra again, the under wire cuts through the material and hurts my arm pits and the bra itself is very itchy :(",B0001HKKQQ
"I bought this bra to wear under a dress with a square neck line. It worked perfectly. The 38D fits well. The bra is a very pretty light girly kind of bra, which my husband noticed!",B0001HKKQQ
"Classic cut bra, perfect for full figure.",B0001HKKQQ
"This bra seemed well made.  The band size is a bit bigger than usual for Panache, but not too big to make this bra unwearable.

The fabric is quite sheer, more see-through than the picture would indicate.

The biggest flaw for me was the oddly shaped cups.  The shaping forces everything to stick out in the front, and there isn't enough stability to do this in a flattering way.  It was an odd fit, because I think if I went down a cup size it would be too small (so the  size was correct) but the fabric still puckered and wrinkled.  Very unflattering.",B0001HKKQQ
"Weirdest bra I've ever bought.
I wear a very standard size, ya every bra is a little different but this bra wasn't even close... weird, just odd. Back in a box and off it went.",B0001HKKQQ
Comfortable bra. I previously had one and wore it on a regular basis for 3 years. Definitely worth the money!,B0001HKKQQ
"This review is for the Panache Tango II underwired balconnet bra.  It's an excellent fit and great support.  I can wear this bra all day without screaming to take it off.  I have a couple of Panache bras and they last forever.  However, the lack of sizing consistency among Panache bras is very frustrating. I bought this bra and the Panache Andorra Full Cup bra in the same size, the later was a good inch shorter in the band and way smaller in cup and straps.",B0001HKKQQ
Straps hurt after wearing awhile! Fit as expected.,B0001HKKQQ
"Well these used to be my favorite bras. The strap adjuster has been moved to the top of the strap and now the straps ""grow"" during the day, having to constantly tighten and put back on my shoulder. The old design was much better. But the biggest complaint is after 31 days of owning the bra (1 day past the return window!), one of the underwires has poked through. Assuming that in addition to the new design, the manufacturer has also changed. Poor quality.",B0001HKKQQ
Fits and looks great!  Came quickly and discretely.,B0001HKKQQ
Nice long waist to keep us tall folk covered. The cloth softens up nicely with a few washings. Great value.,B0001MIB3K
"Good shirt, Great fit, Will buy again",B0001MIB3K
"The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it seems expensive for what is essentially a plain white shirt.  Nothing fancy about it.  It is what it is though, as advertised.",B0001MIB3K
"I wear this shirt waiting tables and I reccomend it to anyone.  When washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings.  The larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms.  I only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color, but still an excellent shirt.",B0001MIB3K
Fit perfectly!  I highly recommend these shorts as they are a perfect replacement for my old tattered shorts. Fine quality and workmanship. I highly advise anyone to purchase these shorts.  Thank you seller!,B0001MJG1Q
Fit great. We're just what I wanted.,B0001MJG1Q
"nice pair of shorts....however, its to bad the belt loops are VERY POORLY made...loops are made with excessive fabric which is folded under loops which makes stringing belt difficult if using a 1 1/2"" belt ... belt gets caught and difficult to push through loop. Also, the in-seam stitch was poorly done and came apart after one day.  I trimmed the loops and restitched the inseam.  Why buy it then? Would have returned it but after my alterations, did not want to hassle.",B0001MJG1Q
So far I love these shorts. Hopefully after a washing or two they will still be good.,B0001MJG1Q
"I bought them for painting shorts, but even so, the quality of the material and especially the rough and sometimes stuck zipper leaves a little to be desired. You get what you pay for. They are cheap shorts cheaply made but they're ok.",B0001MJG1Q
"The item was as described, good quality, and arrived on time",B0001MJG1Q
"One of the most disappointing purchases I have ever made. At least with other bad buys, I was at least able to use them even if briefly. These shorts were way too small. Avoid these.",B0001MJG1Q
Nice shorts! Fit is expected really like the stretch elastic front waist band. Fitwell look sharp!,B0001MJG1Q
The short inseam didn't raise the shorts above the knee as expected.  Otherwise the shorts were good,B0001MJG1Q
"these were BAD size was far from what was ordered material thin and cheap, zippers and button bad quality thats why i returned",B0001MJG1Q
They are WAY shorter than expected - too short - more like 3 inch inseam. I will be returning them,B0001MJG1Q
"For the price these are fine.  As noted on-line they run a little small.  I normally am a 35 waist and was comfortable with 36 waist purchased last year.  So I ordered another pair this year.  I ordered 36 again. However, the seller sent me size 38 because the run small.  These were way too large.  So I returned them.  I will just purchase another pair of shorts locally.",B0001MJG1Q
"Shorts were fine, just didn't look good on me.",B0001MJG1Q
Nice shorts. I prefer above the knee summer shorts and they work well for me.,B0001MJG1Q
Good quality fabric.  Washes up nicely.  Fits as expected and I'm satisfied.,B0001MJG1Q
I wanted replacements for TALOS shorts and these were advertised as that.  Not true.  They are about 2 inches longer and roomier than the TALOS.,B0001MJG1Q
"Nicely made, the quality is very good. I wear a 34 waist but these fit more like a medium (32)",B0001MJG1Q
"My husband loved them hard to find shorts that are not to long, these were perfect.",B0001MJG1Q
Pockets deep enough. Comfy fit.,B0001MJG1Q
The blue color tends to fade after a few times in the wash.,B0001MJG1Q
Zipper. Impossible to zip liked short trying to fix zipper!,B0001MJG1Q
"great fit . I am short and I don't like my shorts hanging on my knees . the 6"" inseam is perfect . very comfy every day shorts",B0001MJG1Q
"I like the 6"" inseam and they're not easy to find in stores.  These fit great and you can's beat the price",B0001MJG1Q
"It's perfect for my job here in the tropics. Plenty of room in the pockets  to carry phones, ipods, and work related nick nacks. It's a perfect fit and not too short. Excellent. I do recommend it for anyone interested. It's great to wear a new piece of clothing for the new year. Happy New Year to all!",B0001MJG1Q
"My old 6"" inseam shorts from Sears are no longer sold and falling apart so I was glad to find these.  I read a lot of reviews from others and found most of the comments to be right on.  The elastic waist is aggressive..... meaning the waist size is fine and I can stick a fist in between my waist and the shorts, but the elastic squeezes tighter than expected.  I don't think these shorts actually fit smaller than I expected, but they feel smaller with the elastic.  The belt loops are a little small.  My standard looking leather belt fits through the loops without too much trouble, but loop that has the belt go through it twice (after it wraps around) takes effort to work the belt through.
Only two washings so far, but the black still looks nice and black.
I like the deep cargo pockets compared to my old shorts.  I carry a folding pocket knife in one of the front cargo pockets and these pockets have plenty of depth so the knife doesn't bottom out in the pocket.",B0001MJG1Q
"Nice looking shorts, looks good on my husband!!",B0001MJG1Q
"After reading what others had to say about their sizing being very small, I ordered one size larger, and they fit very well.  They look to be well made.",B0001MJG1Q
Just what I need during this health ailment,B0001MJG1Q
just right.  Look good and the pockets are great.,B0001MJG1Q
Well made perfect fit. Great price,B0001MJG1Q
"Finally shorts that are shorts, not pants that look like they shrunk in the wash. These are for the person who wears shorts to stay cool not look cool.",B0001MJG1Q
Received a blue pair and not  the Olive I ordered. I tried them on anyway and they were too snug. All my other shorts I have are 38 and they fit well. So I returned for the correct color and went up to 40 and they fit great.,B0001MJG1Q
Just what I was looking for will order again.,B0001MJG1Q
"Good shorts for casual knocking around.  After a few washes, some of the stitching seems to be coming a bit apart so they probably won't last a lont time, but OK for the price, etc.",B0001MJG1Q
"These shorts are perfect if you prefer the athletic look, as opposed to the baggy look kids wear.
They are sturdy and well constructed, with the simple pocket design.",B0001MJG1Q
Just what  I wanted. Great shorts.,B0001MJG1Q
THEY ARE A GOOD FIT AND VERY CONFORTABLE . 6 INCH IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.,B0001MJG1Q
Lol if you want short shorts you found them ;),B0001MJG1Q
"For your short, chubby child these shorts are great.",B0001MJG1Q
"They really do run small, as other reviewers have stated. I have hiking shorts of similar design/construction from a different manufacturer, including a portion of the waistband being elastic, also in size 42. I lost some weight so I need smaller shorts. I bought the same size that ""runs small"", figuring that would do it. Didn't work. I took some fairly accurate measurements. Here's what I learned. My old shorts have an unstretched waistband measurement of 42"", and stretched out are 45"". The Trod shorts are 38"" unstretched, and fully stretched are 42"".  Apparently Trod bases their sizing on the fully-stretched waistband dimension, and unstretched they are 4"" smaller than listed/marked. Beware!

After figuring all this out I needed to exchange my new shorts for the next size up, 44"". No such luck; they are out of stock and will not have khaki in 44"" until next ""shorts season"", Feb of 2018, said they will refund the purchase price.  I'm disappointed by that response. I expected an online seller
to have stock year-around. I didn't want my money back; I want shorts that fit.",B0001MJG1Q
The shorts fit as expected but what's really nice is that they have a short inseam 7 inches.  Which is good if you're not very tall like me and you don't want your shorts pass your knees.,B0001MJG1Q
Quality is good but the elastic in the waist it very strong. It makes the a bit uncomfortable.,B0001MJG1Q
"Husband really liked this color! As with the khaki pair I bought him, he is very impressed with the product's comfort! Hopefully after a washing they will remain this good!",B0001MJG1Q
Perfect for me. I bought 2 pair and they will be used often.,B0001MJG1Q
"Love the added cargo pockets, perfect for I-Phone 7+",B0001MJG1Q
Very happy with them... It's kind of hard to find a men's short with a 6 inch inseam,B0001MJG1Q
"I have four or five pair.  Very comfortable and rage right length for a 5' 8"" guy.",B0001MJG1Q
Even nicer than I expected. Would recommend them to anyone!,B0001MJG1Q
"These shorts are great. I've bought 3 pairs. If you don't want a long short, they are perfect.",B0001MJG1Q
I really like the pair I have with the cell phone/water bottle rear pocket. I wanted another pair but they are out of stock so I bought these same shorts without the special pocket because I really like their cut and fit.,B0001MJG1Q
"Only bought 2 pair to try them out, wish I had run onto them back in the early spring. seem to be well made as I see no loose threads and all pockets align nicely. Love the expandable and belt loops, allows for bloating one day and not the next. Absolutely the best all around shorts I've ever owned. I will be stocking up for next summer.",B0001MJG1Q
"The button at the top of the fly is too small, snaps would be much easier for me.",B0001MJG1Q
"Great  - They  fit well, they're  not too long (6""), lots of pockets, material  is not too thin or thick, and they're  priced  right. Excellent!",B0001MJG1Q
Crouch hung down to about knees,B0001MJG1Q
Great quality and fit. No complaints.,B0001MJG1Q
Very comfy. I love having all the pockets,B0001MJG1Q
"Bad zippers on both pair I bought.  Also, inner thigh seam splitting already on the tan ones after only a few washes.  Not durable so do not recommend.",B0001MJG1Q
I think these shorts look great on my husband. He thinks they may be a little too short ,B0001MJG1Q
"You can't tell but, the pockets are not hanging loose inside the leg & that's what I wanted. So when you sit down if you bring your legs up everything in your pockets doesn't fall out.",B0001MJG1Q
"Zipper is not smooth operating, it jams, disappointed with them",B0001MJG1Q
"A bit tighter than expected. May be the IPA, but I don't think so. Could go up a waist size because of the elastic.",B0001MJG1Q
"Very satisfied with the fit, length, and quality.",B0001MJG1Q
Not all men are tall.  Thanks for making this short at a reasonable length so that my husband does not have to wear shorts past his knees! They wash very well also.,B0001MJG1Q
I do not like the thick thread used on the inside of the waist of the pants.  It is very scratchy.,B0001MJG1Q
I have bought cargo shorts from Sears for some time.  However the quality has continuously declined.  These shorts are what Sears shorts used to be and maybe better. One of the best purchases I have made. I give them my highest recommendation.,B0001MJG1Q
Very pleased. Like the look and fit. Ordered another pair.,B0001MJG1Q
I was going to return them for a larger size t but it cost as much to return the small shorts as they cost so I am going to give them to someone in my church!!,B0001MJG1Q
"waist is not 36 , like i paid for...went to cleaners and thay used a tap in front of me and it was 34. It was miss labled..A good co would replace them..But what do I know ? Im only a customer",B0001MJG1Q
Husband loves this brand and style.,B0001MJG1Q
My husband likes these shorts.  He has a hard time finding the shorter inseams in regular stores.,B0001MJG1Q
Great shorts. Down one star because the zipper was poorly sewn. Otherwise a great pair of shorts and well worth the money.,B0001MJG1Q
The shorts are great - deep pockets - soft comfortable material that is also durable - the length is just right.  Everything about the shorts is as expected or better than expected - except - the zipper.  It is a low quality zipper that is hard to get up and down.  If the zipper was better and more functional this would be the best pair of shorts I have ever had...shoot I have them on right now.,B0001MJG1Q
"not much stretch in these shorts ,not very comfortable .",B0001MJG1Q
Great shorts for short men. I bought 1 pair then quickly bought 2 more!,B0001MJG1Q
Very comfortably good material zipper needs help.  Charge a dollar more use a better zipper.,B0001MJG1Q
"Bought for my husband, and he seems to like them - but not his favorite pair.",B0001MJG1Q
These are ok if you wear them just under your chin- chrotch is way too long,B0001MJG1Q
"The waist is a size 32 without any or very little use of elastic in back
Would be better if sized down a bit because with stuff in pockets shorts slide down
And the cargo pockets in front are NOT cargo pockets just for looks
Still i like them ok",B0001MJG1Q
Really nice looking on hubby.  He loves them.,B0001MJG1Q
"I actually really liked the shorts... but already coming apart at a seam (see photo).  disappointed, because I was about to order in more colors, but clearly not high quality stitching. Only washed twice before seam by zipper started coming apart.",B0001MJG1Q
a little tight compared to my other pants of the same size. zipper a little difficult to close,B0001MJG1Q
Exactly what I was looking for.  If you go to most stores today you will find all the shorts are really long and hang below the knee.  I hate the look and feel of those long shorts.  These fit perfectly and hang just above the knee as shown in the picture.,B0001MJG1Q
I guess not all brands are the same when it comes to fit. I like the style but the fit was too tight. Other brands fit just fine at the same size. I'll just have to exchange them.,B0001MJG1Q
These are very nice shorts for a man who does not want shorts down to his knees,B0001MJG1Q
Poor quality especially the zipper,B0001MJG1Q
"These shorts run a FULL SIZE too small, so if you order one size larger you should be fine.",B0001MJG1Q
Very lightweight but seem to be well made for the price. Nothing fancy.,B0001MJG1Q
Great men's work or casual shorts that aren't too long OR to short.  My husband is tall.. (6'2) and these are perfect length.,B0001MJG1Q
GREAT FIT EXCEPT FOR THE VECRO LINED POCKETS...A REAL PAIN RETRIEVIG ONE'S WALLET//,B0001MJG1Q
"Nice to find ""shorts"" that don't go to my ankles!",B0001MJG1Q
"I have been looking for these for two years. At last a pair of shorts that are what the name implies - SHORT - I am sick of so called shorts or Baggies that seem to be so popular that hang below your knees that are nothing more than pants that have been cut off. Thank heavens someone is making 6 inch inseam shorts. Normally if you do find a pair that has 5 or 6 inch inseam, they are more expensive than the ugly Baggies. These shorts run just a bit small, which is OK with me as I am actually a 33 waist and the 34 in these shorts fit perfect. My only criticism is the zipper sticks a little on both pair. I think that will get better as I wair them. I find these are well made, fairly priced and a good value, I fully intend to buy at least a couple of more pair.",B0001MJG1Q
A bit snug and material of the shorts to thick and heavy for summer use,B0001MJG1Q
Buttons are sewn on using only two of the four holes and very little thread.,B0001MJG1Q
"These are not to large but too LONG! As is often the case these days the inseam length is misstated. These should fall above my knee, at this inseam length. They hit in the middle of the knee, interfering with walking. I don't know what this now decades long obsession is with didsfunctionally long shorts but it's past time for it to be over! These shorts are otherwise perfect.",B0001MJG1Q
I used to buy Talo brand shorts for my husband....no longer sold. Saw these are I actually like them better than Talo,B0001MJG1Q
I purchased the shorts for the six inch inseam because I do not like long shorts.  The fit is right and the color as expected.,B0001MJG1Q
"Fit great, and my husband loved them.",B0001MJG1Q
Just right. The belt loops are a little small which makes putting a web belt in a bit difficult.,B0001MJG1Q
all good product as stated in add,B0001MJG1Q
These are comfortable & practical.  Only draw back was the button which needed to be reinforced.  Still a ggod product.,B0001MJG1Q
Exactly what I had hoped they would be very good fit and quality,B0001MJG1Q
"Great fit- a really nice pair of shorts. I especially liked the fact that the inseam is shorter than most walking shorts, which make a short person like me look 3 feet tall.",B0001MJG1Q
"The fabric is a lightly brushed (sanded) light weight twill at probably 5 oz. The zipper is unbranded, not the smoothest operating, and if anything becomes a problem, it will likely be the zipper.  The shorts are okay so far.",B0001MJG1Q
"Really happy to find a 6"" inseam pair of shorts. I have short legs (27"" inseam) and these shorts keep my legs from looking  ""stubby.""",B0001MJG1Q
Like the fit.  Glad some still makes them.,B0001MJG1Q
Looks nice and they are durable!,B0001MJG1Q
The shorts have potential. The material is too flimsy and wrinkles permanently the first time you sid down.  It all comes out in the warsh but if you wear them more than a couple of hours they are too wrinkled to look fresh.,B0001MJG1Q
"Some shrinking , after 2 washings , that was to be expected.  Zippers are a little stiff & sometimes hard to move , might be due to the small teeth. .. otherwise a good fit.  I will most likely purchase more.",B0001MJG1Q
I ordered these shorts because the stores that I shop at do not carry the shorts with 6 inch inseams. All that are available locally are the longer leg shorts which I do not care for.  The shorts I received fit perfectly and I like the 6 inch inseam and the price seemed reasonable,B0001MJG1Q
"Ordered two pair with apprehension.  They fit great...6"" inseam is perfect for me.  No more shorts that catch the back of my knee and irritate the hell out of me. Will be ordering more.",B0001MJG1Q
"Trod shorts are attractive, sized as expected, and comfortable. Three stars because of one concern: Zipper quality is suspect. Time will tell...",B0001MJG1Q
I love them.  They are well made well.  Soft and very comfortable.... They look very good.,B0001MJG1Q
not too long and very soft.  I like these for work.,B0001MJG1Q
"Good fit above knee shorts, (don't like knee or below knee shorts),Good sized pockets.",B0001MJG1Q
"Edit 2018 - I repurchased more in 2018.  The material was inferior and they were smaller by about 1 inch.  They are no where near as soft and the stitching itches.  The originals I purchased were made in Pakistan.  The ones I purchased in 2018 were made in China.

Here is the original review from 2017:

I switched from Croft and Barrow which are very similar shorts from Kohls.  I like these much better.  These are an inch shorter - which I think makes them a better length for hiking.  The material is softer and very comfortable.  The button will probably won't last through the summer but that is common with this type of short.  I haven't seen the quality problems other reviewer mention, but they are still pretty new.  I do wish they had more colors.",B0001MJG1Q
"My husband loves these -- they fit perfectly, wash and dry beautifully. I've already bought several more since my first purchase, in all the differrent colors (except white).  Highly recommended.",B0001MJG1Q
"Made well, excellent fit and value.",B0001MJG1Q
"They fit nice, not too long.  I have washed once, and I am happy with purchase.  Good value.",B0001MJG1Q
I love these shorts. Just the right length and light weight!,B0001MJG1Q
Fit as advertised. Good qualify,B0001MJG1Q
"Can't wear those around the knee or even longer so called shorts ?
6"" inseam cool & comfortable, nice.",B0001MJG1Q
Heavy thread in waistband is uncomfortable!!,B0001MJG1Q
My short fat husband loves these. Didn't have to pay for hemming. They wash well too.,B0001MJG1Q
A little short in the crotch but otherwise fine,B0001MJG1Q
Just want expected. Good quality.,B0001MJG1Q
"Once again , I received an awesome pair of Shorts....
They were on time , color was perfect & the fit was just right..",B0001MJG1Q
"Fits true to size and the inseam is perfect, love these shorts..the elastic makes them comfortable. It's great to find cargo type shorts with a 6 in inseam...",B0001MJG1Q
Love them I can only find them online,B0001MJG1Q
"They were just a tad tight (and I""m a little guy).  They are good enough for me to keep v sending back and ordering a replacement.  And my other shorts are the same size and fit just fine, so it isn't me or my shifting body.",B0001MJG1Q
"TYROD shorts are the perfect inexpensive walking/working shorts. The price is good, and the quality seems good too.",B0001MJG1Q
Single seam sewing.  May not last!,B0001MJG1Q
Too baggy.  I don't like to wear it because of that.,B0001MJG1Q
It's hard to find the shorter in seam. They fit great and look nice,B0001MJG1Q
Its difficult to find the shorter inseam length in the stores.  These fit the Bill.,B0001MJG1Q
Nice quality & comfortable cargo short. Elastic waist in the back helps with those in between waist sizes.,B0001MJG1Q
Suggest ordering size larger than you usually do,B0001MJG1Q
I bought 4 shorts and am very happy with them.,B0001MJG1Q
"They feel a tad tight around my thighs. But nothing that hopefully a few lbs of weight loss wouldn't cure.  Otherwise, so far, So good.",B0001MJG1Q
Fit is good as is style.  However another dollar or two on the price for a better quality zipper would be a good move.  What's on it now takes a bit of work to get zipped and appears to be a cheap zipper.,B0001MJG1Q
"The product seems good, but the cut was not ideal ... baggier than I expected.",B0001MJG1Q
The shorts are true to size and fit perfectly.  The material is soft and comfortable.i would buy them again.,B0001MJG1Q
Good shorts  I like everything about them,B0001MJG1Q
"I'm a relatively short older guy.  The extra long, baggy shorts that you see on younger people just don't do it for me.  The TROD shorts have a 6 inch inseam and tapered legs that fit and look quite nice.  Plus, they sell at a nice price and come in multiple colors.  Get 'em while you can!",B0001MJG1Q
"Looked all over for shorts like these for hubby.  Can't stand the long, knee length they sell everywhere.  Was surprised with the quality.  The fabric, colors and fit are perfect. We got 3 pair, all 3 colors.  He is very happy.",B0001MJG1Q
"What a great price.  I've finally found shorts that don't go to your knees for a good price.  The fit is great,  but the elastic in the waistband may make them feel snugger than they actually are.  I normally wear a 34 with a belt,  but these fit great with no belt.  The elastic eliminates the need for one.

I would recommend not to underestimate your waist size when ordering.  I think they fit just fine.",B0001MJG1Q
"Nice short.  A little small, should have ordered next size up.",B0001MJG1Q
"Although good looking, because the pants are slightly small, I plan to return the item.  The pant length is 18 1/2 inches.  I probably need something in the 19 1/2 inch range.",B0001MJG1Q
I ordered six of these -- a mistake -- should have ordered one prior to ordering the others. ALL OF THEM HAVE ZIPPERS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ZIP !!! MADE IN CHINA AND ARE DEFECTIVE! I do like the looks and the number of pockets.,B0001MJG1Q
Seem well make. Only complaint is that the elastic is very tight and no I didn't buy a too small size. I expect to use a belt and have the elastic only minimally supportive.,B0001MJG1Q
Fit just right .wash nice also. Good buy,B0001MJG1Q
Harder to find the shorter inseamed shorts and these are it!!,B0001MJG1Q
"nice,deep,pockets,.just.like.talos,,witch.you.cant.get  wayne",B0001MJG1Q
"These cargo shorts were exactly what I wanted and the price was the best of any website that I checked.  Great quality, fit well great deal.",B0001MJG1Q
"Good Fit, Good quality, and you can't beat the price!",B0001MJG1Q
Shorts that don't hit you at the knees.  This length is a better look on my husband.,B0001MJG1Q
Cheaply made knock off of a Weekender short,B0001MJG1Q
"Very good value, good fit. I would recommend this product.",B0001MJG1Q
"I sas hoping to replace my ""Talos"" shorts (also from Bangledesh) but apparently they are no longer available.  These ""Trod"" shorts looked almost identical to my Talos, same size, same fabric composition, same design--but the Trods are not as canvassy, not as heavy-duty jeans-like.  The fabric is softer, the finish is smoother, and the weight is less--and they dry faster (all good things), but I was really looking for work-horse shorts to pair with my ""Weekender"" nicer shorts.  It sounds dumb when I listen to myself, but these shorts are a little ""nicer"" than I was hoping for.  I'll still wear them everyday for work and sport, but now I fear damaging them.  I've been wearing them for a couple months now, successfully, so I shouldn't complain.  They are good shorts and a good deal.",B0001MJG1Q
Great quality construction. Very comfortable.,B0001MJG1Q
Great length.  Nice fabric and well made.  My husband loves them,B0001MJG1Q
"These are great short-shorts. Won't bind your side, cool, comfortable. Need more colors!!! Would be nice if they also has canvas material. I will buy more!",B0001MJG1Q
"They are not too long and not too short.  In the summer I switch to a money clip and it fits nicely in the cargo pockets along with my phone.  Now I just need to find slim V-Neck t-shirts with breast pockets for my glasses.  Yes, I'm getting old but trying to look slim.  Maybe these are middle aged guy shorts but if they are I love them.",B0001MJG1Q
It's all good very happy with the shorts,B0001MJG1Q
My husband likes them.  All he had was jeans and it's way too hot for that. Wash and wear.,B0001MJG1Q
They could be a little tighter in the rear since I have that older man's problem called noassatall.,B0001MJG1Q
"Liked the shorts and are of good quality. Ordered 38 waist. Fit , but was very snug. My waist runs pretty true.",B0001MJG1Q
as advertised. no further information needed.,B0001MJG1Q
"Great comfortable shorts, lots of pockets which I need bought 3 pair different colors.",B0001MJG1Q
The size and shorts were perfect,B0001MJG1Q
"They fit and look good, and I received them faster than expected",B0001MJG1Q
"FINALLY... the search is over. I finally found shorts 6"" inseam that doesn't go below your knees. Old school adult shorts none of that hip hop crap that goes down to your calf. Nice fitting very comfortable.",B0001MJG1Q
"At first, I didn't think I'd like the material. But now they are one of my favorites.",B0001MJG1Q
My husband loves the fit and that they are soft. He wears to work everyday...,B0001MJG1Q
"Yes , very comfortable, fit is as I expected.",B0001MJG1Q
Nice shorts.  Husband likes them a lot.,B0001MJG1Q
thanks these a great for work shorts in southwest Florida,B0001MJG1Q
"The fit was ok.  The fabric was a little ""rougher"" than expected.",B0001MJG1Q
"Look good, fit great...very comfortable.",B0001MJG1Q
100% Cotton and my husband loves them!,B0001MJG1Q
"Finally, a pair of shorts that fit just above the knee, perfectly at the waist, easy care.",B0001MJG1Q
GThese shorts are the best. They fit great and feel great on. I've bought six or seven pairs in different colors and threy are all wonderful. I'll buy more,B0001MJG1Q
I like the look and feel of these shorts but feel the stitching is inadequate. The stitching on the Velcro on one of the pockets came loose the first time I wore them and the button came loose the second time.,B0001MJG1Q
Excellent fit my husband loved them,B0001MJG1Q
"kind of tight in the crotch, feels odd across the ass.  Much improved with some wear.",B0001MJG1Q
"If you wear Weekender Shorts, you need to order the next size larger.  I have a 35"" waste and Weekenders 34 waist fit well (the 36 is too big).  These TRODs are a bit tight. I love the feel and overall look just the next time I will order the larger size.",B0001MJG1Q
"Perfect fit, good quality, perfect",B0001MJG1Q
"My husnand has worn this style Cargo shorts for many years. However, the stores don't carry them anymore. Everything in the stores is so long, its like not even wearing shorts. The ones in the stores are all knee length or longer which are just too long. Not only so they look stupid, they're hot and are more like wearing man Capris than shorts! Its good to finally find shorts that are actually shorts. Will be ordering more!",B0001MJG1Q
Seemed nice just didn't fit. I have other shorts in same size but didn't fit. Disappointed.,B0001MJG1Q
Like the extra pocket for the cellnphone,B0001MJG1Q
really good product. durable and good looking,B0001MJG1Q
The seam on the right leg is coming apart already,B0001MJG1Q
"They have significant mfgr quality issues.
They did make agustments",B0001MJG1Q
Love these shorts.  Seem to be well constructed and fit perfectly.  Love the deep pockets,B0001MJG1Q

"Perfect fit, good quality, perfect",B0001MJG02
Fit perfectly!  I highly recommend these shorts as they are a perfect replacement for my old tattered shorts. Fine quality and workmanship. I highly advise anyone to purchase these shorts.  Thank you seller!,B0001MJG02
Fit great. We're just what I wanted.,B0001MJG02
"nice pair of shorts....however, its to bad the belt loops are VERY POORLY made...loops are made with excessive fabric which is folded under loops which makes stringing belt difficult if using a 1 1/2"" belt ... belt gets caught and difficult to push through loop. Also, the in-seam stitch was poorly done and came apart after one day.  I trimmed the loops and restitched the inseam.  Why buy it then? Would have returned it but after my alterations, did not want to hassle.",B0001MJG02
Nice shorts. I prefer above the knee summer shorts and they work well for me.,B0001MJG02
Good quality fabric.  Washes up nicely.  Fits as expected and I'm satisfied.,B0001MJG02
I wanted replacements for TALOS shorts and these were advertised as that.  Not true.  They are about 2 inches longer and roomier than the TALOS.,B0001MJG02
"Nicely made, the quality is very good. I wear a 34 waist but these fit more like a medium (32)",B0001MJG02
"My husband loved them hard to find shorts that are not to long, these were perfect.",B0001MJG02
Pockets deep enough. Comfy fit.,B0001MJG02
The blue color tends to fade after a few times in the wash.,B0001MJG02
Zipper. Impossible to zip liked short trying to fix zipper!,B0001MJG02
"great fit . I am short and I don't like my shorts hanging on my knees . the 6"" inseam is perfect . very comfy every day shorts",B0001MJG02
"I like the 6"" inseam and they're not easy to find in stores.  These fit great and you can's beat the price",B0001MJG02
"It's perfect for my job here in the tropics. Plenty of room in the pockets  to carry phones, ipods, and work related nick nacks. It's a perfect fit and not too short. Excellent. I do recommend it for anyone interested. It's great to wear a new piece of clothing for the new year. Happy New Year to all!",B0001MJG02
"My old 6"" inseam shorts from Sears are no longer sold and falling apart so I was glad to find these.  I read a lot of reviews from others and found most of the comments to be right on.  The elastic waist is aggressive..... meaning the waist size is fine and I can stick a fist in between my waist and the shorts, but the elastic squeezes tighter than expected.  I don't think these shorts actually fit smaller than I expected, but they feel smaller with the elastic.  The belt loops are a little small.  My standard looking leather belt fits through the loops without too much trouble, but loop that has the belt go through it twice (after it wraps around) takes effort to work the belt through.
Only two washings so far, but the black still looks nice and black.
I like the deep cargo pockets compared to my old shorts.  I carry a folding pocket knife in one of the front cargo pockets and these pockets have plenty of depth so the knife doesn't bottom out in the pocket.",B0001MJG02
"Nice looking shorts, looks good on my husband!!",B0001MJG02
"After reading what others had to say about their sizing being very small, I ordered one size larger, and they fit very well.  They look to be well made.",B0001MJG02
Just what I need during this health ailment,B0001MJG02
just right.  Look good and the pockets are great.,B0001MJG02
Well made perfect fit. Great price,B0001MJG02
Received a blue pair and not  the Olive I ordered. I tried them on anyway and they were too snug. All my other shorts I have are 38 and they fit well. So I returned for the correct color and went up to 40 and they fit great.,B0001MJG02
Just what I was looking for will order again.,B0001MJG02
"Good shorts for casual knocking around.  After a few washes, some of the stitching seems to be coming a bit apart so they probably won't last a lont time, but OK for the price, etc.",B0001MJG02
"These shorts are perfect if you prefer the athletic look, as opposed to the baggy look kids wear.
They are sturdy and well constructed, with the simple pocket design.",B0001MJG02
Just what  I wanted. Great shorts.,B0001MJG02
THEY ARE A GOOD FIT AND VERY CONFORTABLE . 6 INCH IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.,B0001MJG02
Lol if you want short shorts you found them ;),B0001MJG02
The shorts fit as expected but what's really nice is that they have a short inseam 7 inches.  Which is good if you're not very tall like me and you don't want your shorts pass your knees.,B0001MJG02
Quality is good but the elastic in the waist it very strong. It makes the a bit uncomfortable.,B0001MJG02
"Husband really liked this color! As with the khaki pair I bought him, he is very impressed with the product's comfort! Hopefully after a washing they will remain this good!",B0001MJG02
Perfect for me. I bought 2 pair and they will be used often.,B0001MJG02
"Love the added cargo pockets, perfect for I-Phone 7+",B0001MJG02
Very happy with them... It's kind of hard to find a men's short with a 6 inch inseam,B0001MJG02
"I have four or five pair.  Very comfortable and rage right length for a 5' 8"" guy.",B0001MJG02
"These shorts are great. I've bought 3 pairs. If you don't want a long short, they are perfect.",B0001MJG02
I really like the pair I have with the cell phone/water bottle rear pocket. I wanted another pair but they are out of stock so I bought these same shorts without the special pocket because I really like their cut and fit.,B0001MJG02
"Only bought 2 pair to try them out, wish I had run onto them back in the early spring. seem to be well made as I see no loose threads and all pockets align nicely. Love the expandable and belt loops, allows for bloating one day and not the next. Absolutely the best all around shorts I've ever owned. I will be stocking up for next summer.",B0001MJG02
"The button at the top of the fly is too small, snaps would be much easier for me.",B0001MJG02
"Great  - They  fit well, they're  not too long (6""), lots of pockets, material  is not too thin or thick, and they're  priced  right. Excellent!",B0001MJG02
Great quality and fit. No complaints.,B0001MJG02
Very comfy. I love having all the pockets,B0001MJG02
"Bad zippers on both pair I bought.  Also, inner thigh seam splitting already on the tan ones after only a few washes.  Not durable so do not recommend.",B0001MJG02
I think these shorts look great on my husband. He thinks they may be a little too short ,B0001MJG02
"You can't tell but, the pockets are not hanging loose inside the leg & that's what I wanted. So when you sit down if you bring your legs up everything in your pockets doesn't fall out.",B0001MJG02
"Zipper is not smooth operating, it jams, disappointed with them",B0001MJG02
"A bit tighter than expected. May be the IPA, but I don't think so. Could go up a waist size because of the elastic.",B0001MJG02
"Very satisfied with the fit, length, and quality.",B0001MJG02
Not all men are tall.  Thanks for making this short at a reasonable length so that my husband does not have to wear shorts past his knees! They wash very well also.,B0001MJG02
I do not like the thick thread used on the inside of the waist of the pants.  It is very scratchy.,B0001MJG02
I have bought cargo shorts from Sears for some time.  However the quality has continuously declined.  These shorts are what Sears shorts used to be and maybe better. One of the best purchases I have made. I give them my highest recommendation.,B0001MJG02
I was going to return them for a larger size t but it cost as much to return the small shorts as they cost so I am going to give them to someone in my church!!,B0001MJG02
"waist is not 36 , like i paid for...went to cleaners and thay used a tap in front of me and it was 34. It was miss labled..A good co would replace them..But what do I know ? Im only a customer",B0001MJG02
My husband likes these shorts.  He has a hard time finding the shorter inseams in regular stores.,B0001MJG02
Great shorts. Down one star because the zipper was poorly sewn. Otherwise a great pair of shorts and well worth the money.,B0001MJG02
The shorts are great - deep pockets - soft comfortable material that is also durable - the length is just right.  Everything about the shorts is as expected or better than expected - except - the zipper.  It is a low quality zipper that is hard to get up and down.  If the zipper was better and more functional this would be the best pair of shorts I have ever had...shoot I have them on right now.,B0001MJG02
"not much stretch in these shorts ,not very comfortable .",B0001MJG02
Very comfortably good material zipper needs help.  Charge a dollar more use a better zipper.,B0001MJG02
"Bought for my husband, and he seems to like them - but not his favorite pair.",B0001MJG02
These are ok if you wear them just under your chin- chrotch is way too long,B0001MJG02
"The waist is a size 32 without any or very little use of elastic in back
Would be better if sized down a bit because with stuff in pockets shorts slide down
And the cargo pockets in front are NOT cargo pockets just for looks
Still i like them ok",B0001MJG02
Really nice looking on hubby.  He loves them.,B0001MJG02
"I actually really liked the shorts... but already coming apart at a seam (see photo).  disappointed, because I was about to order in more colors, but clearly not high quality stitching. Only washed twice before seam by zipper started coming apart.",B0001MJG02
a little tight compared to my other pants of the same size. zipper a little difficult to close,B0001MJG02
Exactly what I was looking for.  If you go to most stores today you will find all the shorts are really long and hang below the knee.  I hate the look and feel of those long shorts.  These fit perfectly and hang just above the knee as shown in the picture.,B0001MJG02
I guess not all brands are the same when it comes to fit. I like the style but the fit was too tight. Other brands fit just fine at the same size. I'll just have to exchange them.,B0001MJG02
Poor quality especially the zipper,B0001MJG02
"These shorts run a FULL SIZE too small, so if you order one size larger you should be fine.",B0001MJG02
Very lightweight but seem to be well made for the price. Nothing fancy.,B0001MJG02
Great men's work or casual shorts that aren't too long OR to short.  My husband is tall.. (6'2) and these are perfect length.,B0001MJG02
GREAT FIT EXCEPT FOR THE VECRO LINED POCKETS...A REAL PAIN RETRIEVIG ONE'S WALLET//,B0001MJG02
"Nice to find ""shorts"" that don't go to my ankles!",B0001MJG02
"I have been looking for these for two years. At last a pair of shorts that are what the name implies - SHORT - I am sick of so called shorts or Baggies that seem to be so popular that hang below your knees that are nothing more than pants that have been cut off. Thank heavens someone is making 6 inch inseam shorts. Normally if you do find a pair that has 5 or 6 inch inseam, they are more expensive than the ugly Baggies. These shorts run just a bit small, which is OK with me as I am actually a 33 waist and the 34 in these shorts fit perfect. My only criticism is the zipper sticks a little on both pair. I think that will get better as I wair them. I find these are well made, fairly priced and a good value, I fully intend to buy at least a couple of more pair.",B0001MJG02
Buttons are sewn on using only two of the four holes and very little thread.,B0001MJG02
I used to buy Talo brand shorts for my husband....no longer sold. Saw these are I actually like them better than Talo,B0001MJG02
I purchased the shorts for the six inch inseam because I do not like long shorts.  The fit is right and the color as expected.,B0001MJG02
"Fit great, and my husband loved them.",B0001MJG02
Just right. The belt loops are a little small which makes putting a web belt in a bit difficult.,B0001MJG02
all good product as stated in add,B0001MJG02
These are comfortable & practical.  Only draw back was the button which needed to be reinforced.  Still a ggod product.,B0001MJG02
Exactly what I had hoped they would be very good fit and quality,B0001MJG02
"Great fit- a really nice pair of shorts. I especially liked the fact that the inseam is shorter than most walking shorts, which make a short person like me look 3 feet tall.",B0001MJG02
"The fabric is a lightly brushed (sanded) light weight twill at probably 5 oz. The zipper is unbranded, not the smoothest operating, and if anything becomes a problem, it will likely be the zipper.  The shorts are okay so far.",B0001MJG02
"Really happy to find a 6"" inseam pair of shorts. I have short legs (27"" inseam) and these shorts keep my legs from looking  ""stubby.""",B0001MJG02
Like the fit.  Glad some still makes them.,B0001MJG02
Looks nice and they are durable!,B0001MJG02
The shorts have potential. The material is too flimsy and wrinkles permanently the first time you sid down.  It all comes out in the warsh but if you wear them more than a couple of hours they are too wrinkled to look fresh.,B0001MJG02
I ordered these shorts because the stores that I shop at do not carry the shorts with 6 inch inseams. All that are available locally are the longer leg shorts which I do not care for.  The shorts I received fit perfectly and I like the 6 inch inseam and the price seemed reasonable,B0001MJG02
"Ordered two pair with apprehension.  They fit great...6"" inseam is perfect for me.  No more shorts that catch the back of my knee and irritate the hell out of me. Will be ordering more.",B0001MJG02
"Trod shorts are attractive, sized as expected, and comfortable. Three stars because of one concern: Zipper quality is suspect. Time will tell...",B0001MJG02
not too long and very soft.  I like these for work.,B0001MJG02
"Good fit above knee shorts, (don't like knee or below knee shorts),Good sized pockets.",B0001MJG02
"Edit 2018 - I repurchased more in 2018.  The material was inferior and they were smaller by about 1 inch.  They are no where near as soft and the stitching itches.  The originals I purchased were made in Pakistan.  The ones I purchased in 2018 were made in China.

Here is the original review from 2017:

I switched from Croft and Barrow which are very similar shorts from Kohls.  I like these much better.  These are an inch shorter - which I think makes them a better length for hiking.  The material is softer and very comfortable.  The button will probably won't last through the summer but that is common with this type of short.  I haven't seen the quality problems other reviewer mention, but they are still pretty new.  I do wish they had more colors.",B0001MJG02
"My husband loves these -- they fit perfectly, wash and dry beautifully. I've already bought several more since my first purchase, in all the differrent colors (except white).  Highly recommended.",B0001MJG02
"They fit nice, not too long.  I have washed once, and I am happy with purchase.  Good value.",B0001MJG02
I love these shorts. Just the right length and light weight!,B0001MJG02
Fit as advertised. Good qualify,B0001MJG02
"Can't wear those around the knee or even longer so called shorts ?
6"" inseam cool & comfortable, nice.",B0001MJG02
Heavy thread in waistband is uncomfortable!!,B0001MJG02
My short fat husband loves these. Didn't have to pay for hemming. They wash well too.,B0001MJG02
A little short in the crotch but otherwise fine,B0001MJG02
"Once again , I received an awesome pair of Shorts....
They were on time , color was perfect & the fit was just right..",B0001MJG02
Love them I can only find them online,B0001MJG02
"They were just a tad tight (and I""m a little guy).  They are good enough for me to keep v sending back and ordering a replacement.  And my other shorts are the same size and fit just fine, so it isn't me or my shifting body.",B0001MJG02
"TYROD shorts are the perfect inexpensive walking/working shorts. The price is good, and the quality seems good too.",B0001MJG02
Single seam sewing.  May not last!,B0001MJG02
Too baggy.  I don't like to wear it because of that.,B0001MJG02
Nice quality & comfortable cargo short. Elastic waist in the back helps with those in between waist sizes.,B0001MJG02
Suggest ordering size larger than you usually do,B0001MJG02
I bought 4 shorts and am very happy with them.,B0001MJG02
"They feel a tad tight around my thighs. But nothing that hopefully a few lbs of weight loss wouldn't cure.  Otherwise, so far, So good.",B0001MJG02
Fit is good as is style.  However another dollar or two on the price for a better quality zipper would be a good move.  What's on it now takes a bit of work to get zipped and appears to be a cheap zipper.,B0001MJG02
Good shorts  I like everything about them,B0001MJG02
"I'm a relatively short older guy.  The extra long, baggy shorts that you see on younger people just don't do it for me.  The TROD shorts have a 6 inch inseam and tapered legs that fit and look quite nice.  Plus, they sell at a nice price and come in multiple colors.  Get 'em while you can!",B0001MJG02
"Looked all over for shorts like these for hubby.  Can't stand the long, knee length they sell everywhere.  Was surprised with the quality.  The fabric, colors and fit are perfect. We got 3 pair, all 3 colors.  He is very happy.",B0001MJG02
"What a great price.  I've finally found shorts that don't go to your knees for a good price.  The fit is great,  but the elastic in the waistband may make them feel snugger than they actually are.  I normally wear a 34 with a belt,  but these fit great with no belt.  The elastic eliminates the need for one.

I would recommend not to underestimate your waist size when ordering.  I think they fit just fine.",B0001MJG02
"Nice short.  A little small, should have ordered next size up.",B0001MJG02
"Although good looking, because the pants are slightly small, I plan to return the item.  The pant length is 18 1/2 inches.  I probably need something in the 19 1/2 inch range.",B0001MJG02
I ordered six of these -- a mistake -- should have ordered one prior to ordering the others. ALL OF THEM HAVE ZIPPERS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ZIP !!! MADE IN CHINA AND ARE DEFECTIVE! I do like the looks and the number of pockets.,B0001MJG02
Seem well make. Only complaint is that the elastic is very tight and no I didn't buy a too small size. I expect to use a belt and have the elastic only minimally supportive.,B0001MJG02
Fit just right .wash nice also. Good buy,B0001MJG02
Harder to find the shorter inseamed shorts and these are it!!,B0001MJG02
"nice,deep,pockets,.just.like.talos,,witch.you.cant.get  wayne",B0001MJG02
"These cargo shorts were exactly what I wanted and the price was the best of any website that I checked.  Great quality, fit well great deal.",B0001MJG02
"Good Fit, Good quality, and you can't beat the price!",B0001MJG02
Shorts that don't hit you at the knees.  This length is a better look on my husband.,B0001MJG02
Cheaply made knock off of a Weekender short,B0001MJG02
"Very good value, good fit. I would recommend this product.",B0001MJG02
"I sas hoping to replace my ""Talos"" shorts (also from Bangledesh) but apparently they are no longer available.  These ""Trod"" shorts looked almost identical to my Talos, same size, same fabric composition, same design--but the Trods are not as canvassy, not as heavy-duty jeans-like.  The fabric is softer, the finish is smoother, and the weight is less--and they dry faster (all good things), but I was really looking for work-horse shorts to pair with my ""Weekender"" nicer shorts.  It sounds dumb when I listen to myself, but these shorts are a little ""nicer"" than I was hoping for.  I'll still wear them everyday for work and sport, but now I fear damaging them.  I've been wearing them for a couple months now, successfully, so I shouldn't complain.  They are good shorts and a good deal.",B0001MJG02
Great quality construction. Very comfortable.,B0001MJG02
Great length.  Nice fabric and well made.  My husband loves them,B0001MJG02
"These are great short-shorts. Won't bind your side, cool, comfortable. Need more colors!!! Would be nice if they also has canvas material. I will buy more!",B0001MJG02
"They are not too long and not too short.  In the summer I switch to a money clip and it fits nicely in the cargo pockets along with my phone.  Now I just need to find slim V-Neck t-shirts with breast pockets for my glasses.  Yes, I'm getting old but trying to look slim.  Maybe these are middle aged guy shorts but if they are I love them.",B0001MJG02
"Liked the shorts and are of good quality. Ordered 38 waist. Fit , but was very snug. My waist runs pretty true.",B0001MJG02
as advertised. no further information needed.,B0001MJG02
"Great comfortable shorts, lots of pockets which I need bought 3 pair different colors.",B0001MJG02
The size and shorts were perfect,B0001MJG02
"FINALLY... the search is over. I finally found shorts 6"" inseam that doesn't go below your knees. Old school adult shorts none of that hip hop crap that goes down to your calf. Nice fitting very comfortable.",B0001MJG02
"I ordered a size bigger than I usually wear, and it fits around the waist, is roomy elsewhere.  I'm not tall, and have a 28"" inseam, and these hit just about the top of my knee.  Any longer, they'd be like capris on me.... Quite nicely cut and sewn.  I like that the pockets are not overly deep, they stop a couple of inches above the hem so you can dig things out a bit easier.",B0001MJG02
"At first, I didn't think I'd like the material. But now they are one of my favorites.",B0001MJG02
My husband loves the fit and that they are soft. He wears to work everyday...,B0001MJG02
"Yes , very comfortable, fit is as I expected.",B0001MJG02
Nice shorts.  Husband likes them a lot.,B0001MJG02
thanks these a great for work shorts in southwest Florida,B0001MJG02
"The fit was ok.  The fabric was a little ""rougher"" than expected.",B0001MJG02
"Look good, fit great...very comfortable.",B0001MJG02
100% Cotton and my husband loves them!,B0001MJG02
"Finally, a pair of shorts that fit just above the knee, perfectly at the waist, easy care.",B0001MJG02
GThese shorts are the best. They fit great and feel great on. I've bought six or seven pairs in different colors and threy are all wonderful. I'll buy more,B0001MJG02
I like the look and feel of these shorts but feel the stitching is inadequate. The stitching on the Velcro on one of the pockets came loose the first time I wore them and the button came loose the second time.,B0001MJG02
Excellent fit my husband loved them,B0001MJG02
"kind of tight in the crotch, feels odd across the ass.  Much improved with some wear.",B0001MJG02
"If you wear Weekender Shorts, you need to order the next size larger.  I have a 35"" waste and Weekenders 34 waist fit well (the 36 is too big).  These TRODs are a bit tight. I love the feel and overall look just the next time I will order the larger size.",B0001MJG02
"Perfect fit, good quality, perfect",B0001MJG02
Fit perfectly!  I highly recommend these shorts as they are a perfect replacement for my old tattered shorts. Fine quality and workmanship. I highly advise anyone to purchase these shorts.  Thank you seller!,B0001MJG02
Fit great. We're just what I wanted.,B0001MJG02
"nice pair of shorts....however, its to bad the belt loops are VERY POORLY made...loops are made with excessive fabric which is folded under loops which makes stringing belt difficult if using a 1 1/2"" belt ... belt gets caught and difficult to push through loop. Also, the in-seam stitch was poorly done and came apart after one day.  I trimmed the loops and restitched the inseam.  Why buy it then? Would have returned it but after my alterations, did not want to hassle.",B0001MJG02
Nice shorts. I prefer above the knee summer shorts and they work well for me.,B0001MJG02
Good quality fabric.  Washes up nicely.  Fits as expected and I'm satisfied.,B0001MJG02
I wanted replacements for TALOS shorts and these were advertised as that.  Not true.  They are about 2 inches longer and roomier than the TALOS.,B0001MJG02
"Nicely made, the quality is very good. I wear a 34 waist but these fit more like a medium (32)",B0001MJG02
"My husband loved them hard to find shorts that are not to long, these were perfect.",B0001MJG02
Pockets deep enough. Comfy fit.,B0001MJG02
The blue color tends to fade after a few times in the wash.,B0001MJG02
Zipper. Impossible to zip liked short trying to fix zipper!,B0001MJG02
"great fit . I am short and I don't like my shorts hanging on my knees . the 6"" inseam is perfect . very comfy every day shorts",B0001MJG02
"I like the 6"" inseam and they're not easy to find in stores.  These fit great and you can's beat the price",B0001MJG02
"It's perfect for my job here in the tropics. Plenty of room in the pockets  to carry phones, ipods, and work related nick nacks. It's a perfect fit and not too short. Excellent. I do recommend it for anyone interested. It's great to wear a new piece of clothing for the new year. Happy New Year to all!",B0001MJG02
"My old 6"" inseam shorts from Sears are no longer sold and falling apart so I was glad to find these.  I read a lot of reviews from others and found most of the comments to be right on.  The elastic waist is aggressive..... meaning the waist size is fine and I can stick a fist in between my waist and the shorts, but the elastic squeezes tighter than expected.  I don't think these shorts actually fit smaller than I expected, but they feel smaller with the elastic.  The belt loops are a little small.  My standard looking leather belt fits through the loops without too much trouble, but loop that has the belt go through it twice (after it wraps around) takes effort to work the belt through.
Only two washings so far, but the black still looks nice and black.
I like the deep cargo pockets compared to my old shorts.  I carry a folding pocket knife in one of the front cargo pockets and these pockets have plenty of depth so the knife doesn't bottom out in the pocket.",B0001MJG02
"Nice looking shorts, looks good on my husband!!",B0001MJG02
"After reading what others had to say about their sizing being very small, I ordered one size larger, and they fit very well.  They look to be well made.",B0001MJG02
Just what I need during this health ailment,B0001MJG02
just right.  Look good and the pockets are great.,B0001MJG02
Well made perfect fit. Great price,B0001MJG02
Received a blue pair and not  the Olive I ordered. I tried them on anyway and they were too snug. All my other shorts I have are 38 and they fit well. So I returned for the correct color and went up to 40 and they fit great.,B0001MJG02
Just what I was looking for will order again.,B0001MJG02
"Good shorts for casual knocking around.  After a few washes, some of the stitching seems to be coming a bit apart so they probably won't last a lont time, but OK for the price, etc.",B0001MJG02
"These shorts are perfect if you prefer the athletic look, as opposed to the baggy look kids wear.
They are sturdy and well constructed, with the simple pocket design.",B0001MJG02
Just what  I wanted. Great shorts.,B0001MJG02
THEY ARE A GOOD FIT AND VERY CONFORTABLE . 6 INCH IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.,B0001MJG02
Lol if you want short shorts you found them ;),B0001MJG02
The shorts fit as expected but what's really nice is that they have a short inseam 7 inches.  Which is good if you're not very tall like me and you don't want your shorts pass your knees.,B0001MJG02
Quality is good but the elastic in the waist it very strong. It makes the a bit uncomfortable.,B0001MJG02
"Husband really liked this color! As with the khaki pair I bought him, he is very impressed with the product's comfort! Hopefully after a washing they will remain this good!",B0001MJG02
Perfect for me. I bought 2 pair and they will be used often.,B0001MJG02

"I actually really liked the shorts... but already coming apart at a seam (see photo).  disappointed, because I was about to order in more colors, but clearly not high quality stitching. Only washed twice before seam by zipper started coming apart.",B0001MJG02
a little tight compared to my other pants of the same size. zipper a little difficult to close,B0001MJG02
Exactly what I was looking for.  If you go to most stores today you will find all the shorts are really long and hang below the knee.  I hate the look and feel of those long shorts.  These fit perfectly and hang just above the knee as shown in the picture.,B0001MJG02
I guess not all brands are the same when it comes to fit. I like the style but the fit was too tight. Other brands fit just fine at the same size. I'll just have to exchange them.,B0001MJG02
Poor quality especially the zipper,B0001MJG02
"These shorts run a FULL SIZE too small, so if you order one size larger you should be fine.",B0001MJG02
Very lightweight but seem to be well made for the price. Nothing fancy.,B0001MJG02
Great men's work or casual shorts that aren't too long OR to short.  My husband is tall.. (6'2) and these are perfect length.,B0001MJG02
GREAT FIT EXCEPT FOR THE VECRO LINED POCKETS...A REAL PAIN RETRIEVIG ONE'S WALLET//,B0001MJG02
"Nice to find ""shorts"" that don't go to my ankles!",B0001MJG02
"I have been looking for these for two years. At last a pair of shorts that are what the name implies - SHORT - I am sick of so called shorts or Baggies that seem to be so popular that hang below your knees that are nothing more than pants that have been cut off. Thank heavens someone is making 6 inch inseam shorts. Normally if you do find a pair that has 5 or 6 inch inseam, they are more expensive than the ugly Baggies. These shorts run just a bit small, which is OK with me as I am actually a 33 waist and the 34 in these shorts fit perfect. My only criticism is the zipper sticks a little on both pair. I think that will get better as I wair them. I find these are well made, fairly priced and a good value, I fully intend to buy at least a couple of more pair.",B0001MJG02
Buttons are sewn on using only two of the four holes and very little thread.,B0001MJG02
I used to buy Talo brand shorts for my husband....no longer sold. Saw these are I actually like them better than Talo,B0001MJG02
I purchased the shorts for the six inch inseam because I do not like long shorts.  The fit is right and the color as expected.,B0001MJG02
"Fit great, and my husband loved them.",B0001MJG02
Just right. The belt loops are a little small which makes putting a web belt in a bit difficult.,B0001MJG02
all good product as stated in add,B0001MJG02
These are comfortable & practical.  Only draw back was the button which needed to be reinforced.  Still a ggod product.,B0001MJG02
Exactly what I had hoped they would be very good fit and quality,B0001MJG02
"Great fit- a really nice pair of shorts. I especially liked the fact that the inseam is shorter than most walking shorts, which make a short person like me look 3 feet tall.",B0001MJG02
"The fabric is a lightly brushed (sanded) light weight twill at probably 5 oz. The zipper is unbranded, not the smoothest operating, and if anything becomes a problem, it will likely be the zipper.  The shorts are okay so far.",B0001MJG02
"Really happy to find a 6"" inseam pair of shorts. I have short legs (27"" inseam) and these shorts keep my legs from looking  ""stubby.""",B0001MJG02
Like the fit.  Glad some still makes them.,B0001MJG02
Looks nice and they are durable!,B0001MJG02
The shorts have potential. The material is too flimsy and wrinkles permanently the first time you sid down.  It all comes out in the warsh but if you wear them more than a couple of hours they are too wrinkled to look fresh.,B0001MJG02
I ordered these shorts because the stores that I shop at do not carry the shorts with 6 inch inseams. All that are available locally are the longer leg shorts which I do not care for.  The shorts I received fit perfectly and I like the 6 inch inseam and the price seemed reasonable,B0001MJG02
"Ordered two pair with apprehension.  They fit great...6"" inseam is perfect for me.  No more shorts that catch the back of my knee and irritate the hell out of me. Will be ordering more.",B0001MJG02
"Trod shorts are attractive, sized as expected, and comfortable. Three stars because of one concern: Zipper quality is suspect. Time will tell...",B0001MJG02
not too long and very soft.  I like these for work.,B0001MJG02
"Good fit above knee shorts, (don't like knee or below knee shorts),Good sized pockets.",B0001MJG02
"Edit 2018 - I repurchased more in 2018.  The material was inferior and they were smaller by about 1 inch.  They are no where near as soft and the stitching itches.  The originals I purchased were made in Pakistan.  The ones I purchased in 2018 were made in China.

Here is the original review from 2017:

I switched from Croft and Barrow which are very similar shorts from Kohls.  I like these much better.  These are an inch shorter - which I think makes them a better length for hiking.  The material is softer and very comfortable.  The button will probably won't last through the summer but that is common with this type of short.  I haven't seen the quality problems other reviewer mention, but they are still pretty new.  I do wish they had more colors.",B0001MJG02
"My husband loves these -- they fit perfectly, wash and dry beautifully. I've already bought several more since my first purchase, in all the differrent colors (except white).  Highly recommended.",B0001MJG02
"They fit nice, not too long.  I have washed once, and I am happy with purchase.  Good value.",B0001MJG02
I love these shorts. Just the right length and light weight!,B0001MJG02
Fit as advertised. Good qualify,B0001MJG02
"Can't wear those around the knee or even longer so called shorts ?
6"" inseam cool & comfortable, nice.",B0001MJG02
Heavy thread in waistband is uncomfortable!!,B0001MJG02
My short fat husband loves these. Didn't have to pay for hemming. They wash well too.,B0001MJG02
A little short in the crotch but otherwise fine,B0001MJG02
"Once again , I received an awesome pair of Shorts....
They were on time , color was perfect & the fit was just right..",B0001MJG02
Love them I can only find them online,B0001MJG02
"They were just a tad tight (and I""m a little guy).  They are good enough for me to keep v sending back and ordering a replacement.  And my other shorts are the same size and fit just fine, so it isn't me or my shifting body.",B0001MJG02
"TYROD shorts are the perfect inexpensive walking/working shorts. The price is good, and the quality seems good too.",B0001MJG02
Single seam sewing.  May not last!,B0001MJG02
Too baggy.  I don't like to wear it because of that.,B0001MJG02
Nice quality & comfortable cargo short. Elastic waist in the back helps with those in between waist sizes.,B0001MJG02
Suggest ordering size larger than you usually do,B0001MJG02
I bought 4 shorts and am very happy with them.,B0001MJG02
"They feel a tad tight around my thighs. But nothing that hopefully a few lbs of weight loss wouldn't cure.  Otherwise, so far, So good.",B0001MJG02
Fit is good as is style.  However another dollar or two on the price for a better quality zipper would be a good move.  What's on it now takes a bit of work to get zipped and appears to be a cheap zipper.,B0001MJG02
Good shorts  I like everything about them,B0001MJG02
"I'm a relatively short older guy.  The extra long, baggy shorts that you see on younger people just don't do it for me.  The TROD shorts have a 6 inch inseam and tapered legs that fit and look quite nice.  Plus, they sell at a nice price and come in multiple colors.  Get 'em while you can!",B0001MJG02
"Looked all over for shorts like these for hubby.  Can't stand the long, knee length they sell everywhere.  Was surprised with the quality.  The fabric, colors and fit are perfect. We got 3 pair, all 3 colors.  He is very happy.",B0001MJG02
"What a great price.  I've finally found shorts that don't go to your knees for a good price.  The fit is great,  but the elastic in the waistband may make them feel snugger than they actually are.  I normally wear a 34 with a belt,  but these fit great with no belt.  The elastic eliminates the need for one.

I would recommend not to underestimate your waist size when ordering.  I think they fit just fine.",B0001MJG02
"Nice short.  A little small, should have ordered next size up.",B0001MJG02
"Although good looking, because the pants are slightly small, I plan to return the item.  The pant length is 18 1/2 inches.  I probably need something in the 19 1/2 inch range.",B0001MJG02
I ordered six of these -- a mistake -- should have ordered one prior to ordering the others. ALL OF THEM HAVE ZIPPERS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ZIP !!! MADE IN CHINA AND ARE DEFECTIVE! I do like the looks and the number of pockets.,B0001MJG02
Seem well make. Only complaint is that the elastic is very tight and no I didn't buy a too small size. I expect to use a belt and have the elastic only minimally supportive.,B0001MJG02
Fit just right .wash nice also. Good buy,B0001MJG02
Harder to find the shorter inseamed shorts and these are it!!,B0001MJG02
"nice,deep,pockets,.just.like.talos,,witch.you.cant.get  wayne",B0001MJG02
"These cargo shorts were exactly what I wanted and the price was the best of any website that I checked.  Great quality, fit well great deal.",B0001MJG02
"Good Fit, Good quality, and you can't beat the price!",B0001MJG02
Shorts that don't hit you at the knees.  This length is a better look on my husband.,B0001MJG02
Cheaply made knock off of a Weekender short,B0001MJG02
"Very good value, good fit. I would recommend this product.",B0001MJG02
"I sas hoping to replace my ""Talos"" shorts (also from Bangledesh) but apparently they are no longer available.  These ""Trod"" shorts looked almost identical to my Talos, same size, same fabric composition, same design--but the Trods are not as canvassy, not as heavy-duty jeans-like.  The fabric is softer, the finish is smoother, and the weight is less--and they dry faster (all good things), but I was really looking for work-horse shorts to pair with my ""Weekender"" nicer shorts.  It sounds dumb when I listen to myself, but these shorts are a little ""nicer"" than I was hoping for.  I'll still wear them everyday for work and sport, but now I fear damaging them.  I've been wearing them for a couple months now, successfully, so I shouldn't complain.  They are good shorts and a good deal.",B0001MJG02
Great quality construction. Very comfortable.,B0001MJG02
Great length.  Nice fabric and well made.  My husband loves them,B0001MJG02
"These are great short-shorts. Won't bind your side, cool, comfortable. Need more colors!!! Would be nice if they also has canvas material. I will buy more!",B0001MJG02
"They are not too long and not too short.  In the summer I switch to a money clip and it fits nicely in the cargo pockets along with my phone.  Now I just need to find slim V-Neck t-shirts with breast pockets for my glasses.  Yes, I'm getting old but trying to look slim.  Maybe these are middle aged guy shorts but if they are I love them.",B0001MJG02
"Liked the shorts and are of good quality. Ordered 38 waist. Fit , but was very snug. My waist runs pretty true.",B0001MJG02
as advertised. no further information needed.,B0001MJG02
"Great comfortable shorts, lots of pockets which I need bought 3 pair different colors.",B0001MJG02
The size and shorts were perfect,B0001MJG02
"FINALLY... the search is over. I finally found shorts 6"" inseam that doesn't go below your knees. Old school adult shorts none of that hip hop crap that goes down to your calf. Nice fitting very comfortable.",B0001MJG02
"I ordered a size bigger than I usually wear, and it fits around the waist, is roomy elsewhere.  I'm not tall, and have a 28"" inseam, and these hit just about the top of my knee.  Any longer, they'd be like capris on me.... Quite nicely cut and sewn.  I like that the pockets are not overly deep, they stop a couple of inches above the hem so you can dig things out a bit easier.",B0001MJG02
"At first, I didn't think I'd like the material. But now they are one of my favorites.",B0001MJG02
My husband loves the fit and that they are soft. He wears to work everyday...,B0001MJG02
"Yes , very comfortable, fit is as I expected.",B0001MJG02
Nice shorts.  Husband likes them a lot.,B0001MJG02
thanks these a great for work shorts in southwest Florida,B0001MJG02
"The fit was ok.  The fabric was a little ""rougher"" than expected.",B0001MJG02
"Look good, fit great...very comfortable.",B0001MJG02
100% Cotton and my husband loves them!,B0001MJG02
"Finally, a pair of shorts that fit just above the knee, perfectly at the waist, easy care.",B0001MJG02
GThese shorts are the best. They fit great and feel great on. I've bought six or seven pairs in different colors and threy are all wonderful. I'll buy more,B0001MJG02
I like the look and feel of these shorts but feel the stitching is inadequate. The stitching on the Velcro on one of the pockets came loose the first time I wore them and the button came loose the second time.,B0001MJG02
Excellent fit my husband loved them,B0001MJG02
Nice shorts! Fit is expected really like the stretch elastic front waist band. Fitwell look sharp!,B0001MJG02
The short inseam didn't raise the shorts above the knee as expected.  Otherwise the shorts were good,B0001MJG02
"these were BAD size was far from what was ordered material thin and cheap, zippers and button bad quality thats why i returned",B0001MJG02
They are WAY shorter than expected - too short - more like 3 inch inseam. I will be returning them,B0001MJG02
"For the price these are fine.  As noted on-line they run a little small.  I normally am a 35 waist and was comfortable with 36 waist purchased last year.  So I ordered another pair this year.  I ordered 36 again. However, the seller sent me size 38 because the run small.  These were way too large.  So I returned them.  I will just purchase another pair of shorts locally.",B0001MJG02
"Shorts were fine, just didn't look good on me.",B0001MJG02
"This is the perfect fleece. Good weight. Breathable. Aaaaand the pockets actually hold things when they aren't zipped. you all know you've had those coats that have awkward pockets to where everything falls out. (I like good pockets) The cuffs are tight enough to hold extra length back when you are washing your hands. The thumb holders are smooth and do not irritate or rub on your thumbs
It was engineered well.",B0001N5Y70
"It looks prettier in picture.
It is more informal than exoected.",B0001N5Y70
"Purchased this for my wife and she loves it. Very cozy. I have man's version, have had it for several years and also like it a lot. It is great, light fleece of great quality, washes well, durable. Works well on its own or as a layer for colder days.",B0001N5Y70
I wore this as a base layer during a trip to Northern Sweden.  Lightweight but warm.  Great item for anyone who wants to layer in warmth.,B0001N5Y70
"The jacket is warm, really smart looking, and sporty. My problem is that the yellow dye got all over what was being washed. Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting. Upon rewashing (minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket) the yellow dye came out. Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy. In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected, especially, with a product such as this. As a precaution, wash by hand separately and let it hang dry, you still have to be careful with the ""drip dry"" in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip. Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.

I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time. One as a gift, and the other for me. Learning ing how these jackets ""wash"" was a disappointment, however, wearing this jacket does feel exactly as described.",B0001N5Y70
"She was thrilled and put it on right away. The size was perfect for her, using normal sizing numbers and of good quality.",B0001N5Y70
Product look like good but the bad things about this jacket it is not clean. There are 3 yellow spots over the jacket. Two of them on the front over the left pocket the other at the  back side. Hopefully when I wiped them the spots gone. But this is not a good buying experience for me.,B0001N5Y70
"Great jacket!! I usually wear a medium or large tshirt. I'm 135 lb, 5'8"". Got it in large-love it!!",B0001N5Y70
LOVE! I bought a Columbia fleece in a size small  hoping it would fit nicely but it was too baggy. This fits great! It is fitted so if you want something looser order a size up. I am 5'2 and weigh 125. I had a problem zipping up the North Face jackets over my bust but this jacket had enough stretch it fit perfect! Love it!! I'm taking it to Iceland for vacation and will try and update this review to let you know what I think!,B0001N5Y70
It has a dingy grey color.  It looks more white in the picture. but I love the fit and it is a nice jacket.  I am happy.  Just wish it was more white.  Should have gotten the white one.,B0001N5Y70
I very like it. just the price is hight.,B0001N5Y70
"this was a great price for a Marmot jacket. my wife say's it's warmer than she thought it would be, and what woman doesn't love thumbholes?! if i get her warm tops with thumbholes, that girl is happy (and that makes me happy). plus the atomic blue is an awesome color.

to be helpful, sizing is spot on (as another person mentioned). if you're buying this as a gift, to give you an idea...my wife is about 5' 2"" and about...well...she's about 110lbs maybe soaking wet. i hope she doesn't see this review, but i can justify it by trying to help out the amazon community! (right?). (i hope anyway).",B0001N5Y70
My wife really likes this sleeping bag.,B0001N5T2K
"The cap is very form fitting and ""beanie"" like. It was not attractive and not what I was looking for. I think this cap is strictly for running or similar sports and not an everyday cap. The Chiller technology was the main reason I ordered this cap because I like the idea of keeping cool while hiking or other summer activities. Unfortunately I did not get to try that part of it out because I returned the cap to Amazon.",B0001N5T2K
"Absolute Best Toe Socks Ever! I bought several colors and they all fit perfect even after washing. I tried other brands and they either didn't hold up or the threads pulled inside the toes after washing them. Toe Toe toe socks fit perfect, feel soft and wash well. Easier than other brands to put on too. I absolutely love them and would recommend them to anyone.",B0001ONF16
"I am extremely happy with these socks. It is difficult to find calf length toe socks in a basic toe sock. I use them specifically for cycling rides of over 50 miles. Cycle shoes tend to be snug fitting and the socks allow my toes the comfort of their own individual spaces. I no longer suffer from hot toe or one toe irritating another toe on a long ride. The socks are very well made without being loud and drawing any attention. Yet, the white, calf fit allows drivers to see me on my bike. I will be ordering additional socks.",B0001ONF16
"Very comfortable toe socks, worn alone or as sock liners",B0001ONF16
"These shorts fit but they obviously are not ""full cut"". Fortunately they have an elastic waist or they would have cut into me each time I sit.",B0001SLU8W
"These are very high quality shorts and fit perfectly. I have several of those; definitely recommended, especially for guys with bigger belly's.",B0001SLU8W
"Great shorts, they're the only brand I wear.",B0001SLU8W
"Very nice shorts; the color is wonderful, and I hope to enjoy wearing them for a long time.",B0001SLU8W
"If I order this type of shorts again, it will be a size or two smaller. At least one size samller. the Waist-Relaxer type.",B0001SM8GK
Best shorts I've found anywhere.  Would like to get some lighter colors if available.,B0001SM8GK
"Well made, fit perfect, easy to care for.",B0001SM8GK
"Great shorts, they're the only brand I wear.",B0001SM8GK
"Very nice shorts; the color is wonderful, and I hope to enjoy wearing them for a long time.",B0001SM8GK
These shorts are more than what I expected.  Great quality and fit exactly to my size.  The built in expanding waistband makes the the most comfortable shorts I have found.  Very comfortable especially sitting or driving.  Going to order more in different colors.,B0001SM8GK
"Good quality, well made.  I like the elastic band built in.  But showed me I MUST lose weight!  Lost -25 lbs, now they are way too big.  Thank you Big & Tall for forcing me to try VERY LOW Carb diet!!!!!!!!!!",B0001SM8GK
"These shorts fit but they obviously are not ""full cut"". Fortunately they have an elastic waist or they would have cut into me each time I sit.",B0001SM8GK
"Bought for husband, and he likes them. I told him he needs more color instead of just khaki or navy. They're a darker grey in color, so he'll be able to mix with other shirts. Washes well.",B0001SM8GK

It's very versatile. It can be a scarf or something to wrap around your face. There are youtube videos showing all the different ways to wrap this.,B0001VRXHG
nice cloth very simple but they have a little bit of a hard time through the dryer but end up being ok just shrinking a bit,B0001VRXHG
great to have on windy or cold days,B0001VRXHG
"Perfect.  My favorite color is yellow and I wanted another shemagh.  Two birds with one stone, sort to say.  It, like any of the shemaghs, they need some initial soaking and washing to remove the excessive dyes.",B0001VRXHG
"I love using these Shemagh's.  I use it in the winter to cover my face when shoveling snow, in the summer when mowing the lawn or working in the yard to keep the sweat out of my eyes.  I've used it as bib when eating BBQ, as a sling for first aid, as a wrap to hold on a gauze bandage, as a handkerchief, hand towel, napkin, placemat for cleaning handguns.

Washes out perfectly in the washing machine.

I carry one in my car at all times and one in my back pack.  I use them on a weekly basis for all sorts of situatons.  Love them.",B0001VRXHG
Very nice product.  Good quality.  Wears well.  Large enough for good coverage.  Other ones like this are usually small and thus cannot be wrapped properly.  I HIGHLY recommend.,B0001VRXHG
"Works great, instructions very clear too, got me arrested, going to Temple next week, hahaha",B0001VRXHG
I originally bought this shirt for a Halloween costume but after wearing it I think I might have a new favorite shirt.,B0001W1L6E
"I saw this online and was worried how it may look. The colors are vibrant, it looks cool, and it's actually very comfortable. Just what I wanted. Thanks!",B0001W1L6E
Neon green should not be called olive. Good fit and quality but it is the same safety bright green color as what is worn by prison inmates here who clean along the sides of the highways. Olive is more subdued and should blend in with the natural background.,B0001W7IHU
great buy would reconsider size otherwise really love the light weight material and should buy more but bought something else too with better fiit,B0001W7IHU
Sweet thermal...although its more of a clima cool perforated style shirt. Keeps me not too hot and not too cold under my boarding jacket.,B0001W7IHU
"These work fine, but if you snag the fabric it runs. :(  I stopped buying them because they were not durable on the long run!  Comfy and very light weight and they do breath well.  I wouldn't buy these again.  YMMV.  They also stain too easily. :(  I haven't tried to bleach the stains out.",B0001W7IHU
"ran a bit small, other wise i like it.",B0001W7IHU
"I'm outside in a dusty environment so sunscreen is out. This keeps me surprisingly cool, and it fits great. My peeve is that it is like a fine knit so it is prone to snags",B0001W7IHU
"i like these and have five of them. The only problem is they snag so easily that after the first wearing every one had at keast two snags in them.  So they are fine for an underwear layer, but I can no longer wear them as outerwear.",B0001W7IHU
Soft and breaths well.  I use it under a vest for winter and keeps me warm.  Do not like bulky shirts and this is very lightweight so works great as base layer.,B0001W7IHU
I wear these as long-sleeve shirts under casual short sleeve button down shirts (my standard wardrobe during the colder months). These are comfortable in terms of the cut and feel of the fabric. I also like the colors.,B0001W7IHU
"Very light and comfortable, good fit, true to size. Good looking as well, requires only regular washing, dries quickly, and doesn't chafe around the neck and underarms. I've got six and am buying more!",B0001W7IHU
My husband LOVES these.  We live in warm humid climate but it does get cold sometimes and this really works well because it's still lightweight but can be worn under a warmer fleece vest.,B0001W7IHU
"These are ok shirts. The one thing that I did not like about them is that they snag and run easily. I bought then to wear as a summer shirt. I sun burn easily so I wanted to have sum coverage on my arms. great for on the beach, but not some much for camping and hiking as an outer shirt. Great for winter as an undershirt.",B0001W7IHU
My husband fell in love with these! He works in the tunnels and they're the perfect layer to keep him warm and comfortable on winter nights.,B0001W7IHU
Very light and breathable. The fit is perfect. Great for working out or running. I love the color and the material. I recommend it.,B0001W7IHU
Holding up well so far.  Comfortable and lightweight,B0001W7IHU
"Tends to pill, but just turn it inside out when you wash, then line dry",B0001W7IHU
Fits as expected.  Have not had any problems.  jo,B0001W7IHU
My son wore this under his sweatshirt during the storm and said no wind went through this shirt.,B0001W7IHU
"My bf is 6'8"" and these fit him perfectly!  They are long enough and comfortable-and not bulky for winter running.",B0001WAZGG
"These things are amazingly warm for their thickness.  I have these and a couple sets of the Cross Country pants, and I'm extremely pleased with both. This are lightweight, can be worn indoors, and have open, not zip, pockets (this might be important to someone buying them as a running pant).  I use them running, hiking, primarily but also when weightlifting in an unheated basement.  For hiking, be aware they are not really for off trail, the fabric would snag too easily.

The sizing comment in the review is dead on, Sporthill's XXL is everyone else's XL.  I talked with the manufacturer about this, they were apparently unaware of it.  The pants are loose, but not enough to make up for undersizing.

I haven't had any problems washing them as the one review describes.  You don't want to put them in the dryer, but they readily air dry. Actually, thinking about it, these may be able to go in the dryer and the other ones can't, but I air dry them regardless as I just don't put my Sporthill stuff in the dryer in general.  Washing is fine though.",B0001WAZGG
"I love it and wear it every time I bike early in the morning. However be cautious when selecting the size. For all my pants my waist size is 38-40. However I ordered the XX-large and it fits perfectly. Accordingly to Amazon chart this would correspond to 44-46!!!
In fact I went with XX-large because of a similar item I previously had ordered (and returned). I had ordered a X-large and I could barely put it on!",B0001WAZGG
I've been wearing the Voyage pant for as long as they have been around. They are my all time favorite running pant hands down.,B0001WAZGG
"The pants are comfortable. However, the brand new pair I received had a 2"" hole in the pocket where the seam wasn't properly sewn together. I emailed sport hill to report the issue and they never responded (waited for 2 weeks). I was led to believe sport hill was a stand up company; I guess I was wrong.",B0001WAZGG
"I've been wearing Sporthills, this type as well as the xc for really cold weather, for many years and really like them.",B0001WAZGG
"Although I have worn this style of pants from SportHill for years, this pair is a bit short. It still works fine for running, hiking etc., but I would have preferred a bit more length.  That said, the pockets are longer and better; you're not as likely to lose your keys, ID, etc.",B0001WAZGG
awesome deal on these great running pants,B0001WAZGG
"BEST PANTS , WELL WORTH THE MONEY,  I OWNED A PAIR FOR 10 YEARS THAT ARE STILL IN GREAT SHAPE, THESE ARE SO COMFORTABLE",B0001WAZGG
"I've owned these for years and use them primarily for playing Platform Tennis all winter long.  They're wonderful, versatile and easy to care for.  They also make this old man's bum look pretty good!",B0001WAZGG
"These pants are almost like the original Sport Hill's I got 15 years ago,  I just hope this pair lase as long.",B0001WAZGG
"These are great track pants.  The material is a soft fine synthetic knit and fitment is great--neither baggy nor super tight.  Form-fitting.  I use these for running and biking.  Love the tapered legs with spandex band on the ends and zipper (although not needed).  My only gripe is the sizing.  Based on the Sporthill size chart, I bought Medium Long.  I am 6', 185lb and usually just buy medium pants.  The Medium Long was about 2"" too long!  Still doable since the form fitting allows for some bunching but unless regular pants are too short or you like wearing your pants above your hips rather than on your hips, I would recommend plain mediums (or the your size but without ""short"" or ""long"").  Now some men have really beefy legs--I would not recommend these pants to you.  In terms of tapered track pants, these are the most form-fitting I have tried on.  If I had massive legs, they would be tights, not just pants.

Downside:  side pockets are there but not zippered like some of SportHill's other pants.

Update:  Have since bought SportHill Nomad pants.  I actually like these better than the Voyage.  The material is silkier and the side pockets have zippers.  Great fitment and very comfortable.",B0001WAZGG
"Have owned Sporthill pants since mid eighties, this pants are the gold standard (bought my wife a pair a week after receiving mine--she was borrowing them).  Sporthill is at tip top of running gear companies.",B0001WAZGG
"Excellent quality.  Second pair ordered after wearing other pair for 6 years.  Long enough for 6'1"" guy.",B0001WAZGG
I liked them when I first wore them but they shranked some and fit tight,B0001WAZGG
"Don't be fooled by the good reviews.

They look like sweats.
The feel like sweats
They are sweats.

if what you really want is an expensive pair of sweats than they're great. But, if you don't like the look of sweats they're not so great.",B0001WAZGG
"My husband needed a new pair after years of wear on his old ones.  The quality, fit and value are always consistent for this product.",B0001WAZGG
"Durable, good weight, quality product, fits abut as expected.  Last pair hung on for 15 years.",B0001WAZGG
"Hubby received these for a gift, put them on and hasn't removed them. Loves the fit, durability, and function.",B0001WAZGG
great material and product.  Quality made,B0001WAZGG
These pants are perfect. They fit not tight or loose. Very comfortable. Unbelievably soft and warm for their thickness and block any wind I've encountered. Pockets are pretty deep. You can run down into the 20s with them before even thinking about baselayer. I have 3 pair and am perfectly satisfied.,B0001WAZGG
Exactly what i was looking for. Not too thin and not too thick. I'm using for a light jacket for layering. True to size. True camo print.,B0001XH84C
"Well, for me, after a cycle in the washer/dryer, I found the 2XL in this garment to be a bit too long in the sleeves, and too short in the body. The sleeves were about a 1/2"" or so on the long side, and I have long arms, while the body length should have been at least 2"" longer.
The material is sturdy and should wear well, but the sizing appears to be off. I doubt that I'll have much use for this jacket.",B0001XH84C
To many coplain about rothco brand because of where they are made of quality.  Ive had zero issues at all with this company or quility. This shirt is comfortable and well made. Im ruffnon my cloths and this brand takes longer to where out then more expensive ones. I will for sure buy more and more.,B0001XH84C
Exactly what you expect for a good quality camo shirt. I have several for my hunting trips and haven't worn one out yet.,B0001XH84C
The size chart was not even close to the actual size of vest.,B0001XWPUE
Bought this vest for my grandson. He loves it!,B0001XWPUE
"Excellent quality vest and we loved it. So it was a bummer that we had to return because the size was way off! We bought the X-Large and it was just too small to have an XL label on it. My son is a petite 11-year old, who is usually a Medium, and this was too short and too tight on him. We bought the XL to make allowances for it to run small, but that was too much. Beautiful vest otherwise, inside and out!",B0001XWPUE
Love it!! Fits great and the quality is excellent,B0001XWPUE
It is a REALLY nice vest! Looks great!,B0001XWPUE
Very nice looking suede vest.  Our 5-year old is so proud of his cowboy vest and wears it every chance he gets.,B0001XWPUE
This vest is excellent quality.  We purchased it for a play where our son was the mayor and this gave him an authentic cowboy look versus a costume look.,B0001XWPUE
it runs small. my son is a med/large and i went w/a large. it looked like a small! it sort of looked like a Halloween costume. thats not the look that i was going with so i returned it.,B0001XWPUE
love the tees fit and wear perfectly,B0001Y6DHO
"Wore out my old BDUs so went looking for new - GOT to have the pockets.  These are great!  As good as Uncle Sam gave me all those years ago.  I wanted somthing with long sleeves I could roll up in warm temps but pull them down and be heavy enough to work as a light jacket when the temps turn cool... AND THE POCKETS!  If your looking for a shirt for similar reasons, you can't go wrong getting one or more of these.
Happy Camper",B0001Y65TK
"Order came in a timely manner, and was exactly what was shown. Will order from this company again.  Very nicely made.",B0001Y65TK
"When I ordered this item my initial use was to use it to go hunting and camping because I thought the material was a little softer like an ordinary shirt, but when I received it I got something totally different, the material is rough and thick and almost heavy on wearing which is fine by me because it could also be used as a coat my only problem with this item and the reason i didn't rate it a 5 was because even though I'm at 6'3 190 pounds and this item sized at medium it is still a little to big! So choose your sizes carefully.",B0001Y65TK
This is a solid shirt with all the pockets you would expect.  Can't go wrong with this Camo Shirt.,B0001Y65TK
I bought this for my brother for paintball and he seemed to be very happy with it in terms of looks and fit.,B0001Y65TK

Love this camo pattern. The shirt is comfortable and plenty of pockets. I know the fabric is strong enough to go through a breyer thicket with out any issues because I have done it. The size is on target. I would recommend.,B0001Y65TK
I like the fabric n color. Perfect fit for my boyfriend!!,B0001Y65TK
Feels good. Great sturdy fabric. Im 150lbs and 6ft. Got a medium long and it fit great. Not tight but not super loose. Would purchase again.,B0001Y65TK
"Very good bdu shirt, high quality at a reasonable price.",B0001Y65TK
"I bought a large because I wear a large in Rothco pants.  The arms and overall length of the shirts are very short. The width is more than I need. I think going up a size (which would mean a return) would just get me a bigger overall size with the same short sleeve and overall length problem. I guess I will either give this away and order from a different company. Quality shirt, just oddly sized.",B0001Y65TK
Too large for body and sleeves are too short. Sending back.,B0001Y65TK

Beautiful coloring and great quality. Love it totaly,B0001Y65TK
GREAT PRODUCT GREAT COLOR PATTERN ALL IS WELL.....,B0001Y65TK
I do like the shirt.fits very well.just order one size biger.,B0001Y65TK
It worked out perfect for what I wanted! A simmunitions cover shirt!,B0001Y65TK
"Good quality BDU shirt in Woodland Camo print. Offers great concealment for hunting in spring, summer, and early fall. Looks just like the military issued shirt. I'm 5' 9"" 160 Lbs.  I got mine in medium and it fits perfect. Highly recommend it.",B0001Y65TK
"Good quality,  fits perfectly.  Awesome addition to hunting wear.",B0001Y65TK
"I like this top, the material is a little on the light side compared to the average bdu. But, it does work to my advantage in the summer heat. As of now it's been holding up, I'm not wearing it during war but I've beaten it around on a private range rolling around in the dirt.",B0001Y65TK
Fit my husband perfectly. Good quality!,B0001Y65TK
The shirt I received looks NOTHING like the one in the photo. The one I got is very dark.,B0001Y65TK
Very happy with product and fit.,B0001Y65TK
"A great, rugged shirt! After reading the reviews about the sizing concerns, here is my line: I am 6.2', 175 lbs., 42"" chest, and normally wear a ""Large"" in shirts. I ordered a ""Medium"" and it fits perfectly, including proper sleeve length. I intend to wear this alone as a shirt, occasionally with a t-shirt underneath. If I were to wear this over another regular shirt, it would be too tight in the chest. Material is durable and well-stitched; quite stiff until broken in. Nice, roomy pockets. Tiger stripe camo pattern perfectly matches a pair of my BDU pants from the late 1970s. The button tabs at 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock on back work well; without them, the shirt would have very ample room for those with a larger mid-section. Overall, I am pleased with the product, and look forward to wearing it a good bit in the great SC outdoors! Hope the attached photos prove to be helpful.",B0001Y65TK
"The arms were a bit too wide, so I had it taken in. Other than that I love it!",B0001Y65TK
"Was looking at pants and it said these jacket go with them, when they arrived the material and look was different.  I can only blame myself for not looking at the description and taking the websites word for it.",B0001Y65TK
"The durability alone will make you buy this shirt. I love BDU's , as I was for many years doing security and our uniforms were as such. Moreover in my non work life, this type of shirt is very comfortable, useful and great looking. In cooler weather can be used as an extra layer almost like a jacket. The shirt has big pockets that are great if you don't want to carry items in your hands or pants pockets. Pair this shirt up with the same brand BDU pants and you have a look that is not only functional but can also fit in many situations. Use this for everyday knock around shirt, for fishing, camping and of course if you do security it's a winner. The price is right for this versatile shirt. Buy true to your size. It suppose to be big almost like a jacket but it is a shirt. For the price this is a steal. Buy a few today!",B0001Y65TK
"Great material and look. I would recommend size small for 5'3"" 130lbs.",B0001Y65TK
Very well made. Military spec. Will buy again. Good value.,B0001Y65TK
Good shirt held its color and was awesome,B0001Y65TK
"Kinda small, bought a medium, should of bought a large, the fit is not the best",B0001Y65TK
"I honestly figured this would be a little bit larger than listed, judging by the feedback. I wear a 2x faithfully and ordered as such, with plans to dryer shrink it. Let me tell you, I dried this for 2 hours and it's still a true 4x shirt. It's like a black moo moo or night gown. Great material, so great they could've made me two shirts out of t!",B0001Y65TK
"Great price, a bit large, seems solid so far and makes me feel super ready to join my local militia.",B0001Y65TK

"I'm 5'4 and purchased a size small, love the fit and style. Very Kim K-esque!",B0001Y65TK
great vietnam era pattern he needed for costume,B0001Y65TK
Bought this for a water survival class and wore it in a pool for a week.  Fit was okay but it was pretty short.  somehow I got a maternity version that has buttons with an expander on the sides.  Color is slightly different than other brands so get the same brand top/bottom if it's important,B0001Y65TK
fits good and is exactly what I wanted,B0001Y65TK
"Looks really good, pretty nice quality other than a few misplaced stitches, also it came really early and way ahead of schedule, but make sure to order 1 size smaller than you are, its pretty big, for example I'm medium so i ordered a small.",B0001Y65TK
This is a nice heavy weight pull over,B0001Y65TK
I love this shirt!!! It's thick enough to be worn as a light jacket which is how I wore it. I wanted it to be slightly oversized so I ordered a xl. Normally in mens I wear a medium or a large.,B0001Y65TK
"I bought this for my dad as a gift after his previous BDU shirt wore out after several years of regular wear. It runs a little large; it would be ideal if Tall sizes were available, then I would have gone a size down. Construction is solid. The pockets held up from regular use as well. I would recommend this for veterans or anybody interested in BDUs.",B0001Y65TK
"Good for the price, mine came running large but ok",B0001Y65TK
"This shirt is definitely high quality. I expect to get many years of use out of it and paired with the Rothco BDU pants you get an affordable, durable hunting camo solution...",B0001Y65TK
"Solid design. Good stitiching. Thick and durable material. I have not washed it yet so I cannot comment on fading characteristics yet.

One of the best materials of any BDU blouse I have ever owned.",B0001Y65TK
To big in the shoulders. Fits and feels more like a light jacket than  a shirt. There needs to be a lot more clarification on what the actual standard short sizes are for these types of products. A way to convert the listed military sizes to a civilian equivilent,B0001Y65TK
"It is very similar to a safari jacket I had several years ago, which was lost, however at a much lower price. I used it to travel, and all those pockets come in handy for passport, boarding passe, etc. Good workmanship and fits nicely over a regular shirt.",B0001Y65TK
"I loved it, although bit big for a medium that I got?, but still very cool- although it's definitely could pass for a light jacket more than a typically expected shirt- pocketd at the torso helps for feeling this way as well. very cool looking",B0001Y65TK
"Heavy made, good fit and carry's load well in pockets.",B0001Y65TK
"Good color and comfort, but sizing is strange. Extremely short waisted and wide, but with incredibly long sleeves. Runs very large in general.",B0001Y65TK
Love the style and the way it's made !,B0001Y65TK
Very rugged very thick nice shirt only 4 stars cuz not usd to cargo shirt,B0001Y65TK
"Runs a little big, had to go to a Large.",B0001Y65TK
"I picked this up for use with a costume and it served its purpose quite well.  I went with khaki as I going for a sort of steampunk safari guy look but didn't want to spend $70 to $200 on an actual safari jacket (nice though those are).  In order to make it work, however, I needed to modify things slightly.  I painted the buttons and glued some decorative gears on them (thin flat gears so as to still be able to use the buttons), I did the same for the adjustment buttons along the sides and the cuff buttons.  Additionally, as the buttons are hidden and I wanted the appearance of buttons down the front at least I sewed some of these same gears (built up a bit to look more like buttons) on along the button line.  Also added some other bits to make it work.

It worked quite well for cosplay, and from a practical standpoint I am sure it will hold up quite well.  The stitching is all well done and solid, there are spots where they could have perhaps been a little more careful to trim the thread off closer to the garment but that is just being nit picky.  Its at least as good as the other BDU uniform jackets I have and was a lower price.  I would heartily recommend this for either practical or costuming purposes.",B0001Y65TK
Nice solid shirt. Tough fabric. It should last a long time.,B0001Y65TK
"my son, who I bought it for loved it, he stands 6'5"" tall and said it fit just fine and was perfect.",B0001Y65TK
"Looks as good as the one I had while I was in the military. Fit was a bit large, though. Make sure you check your sizes first! I believe the Large Regular would fit me better. the sleeves seem to run a bit longer than normal.",B0001Y65TK
Sleeves are a bit long and wide but a great shirt/buy. Shirt length could be a little longer as well.,B0001Y65TK
"I wear a size XL hoodie, I am 5'10"" 185lbs.  I ordered the Large because the chest size is slightly smaller than what I wear in a hoodie, well this thing arrived today and you could easily fit 2 of me in it.  It is like a rain poncho on me, and even though I have pretty long arms the sleeves go past my knuckles.  I just reordered a medium, i'm just hoping it's not too small because I haven't worn a size medium anything in almost 20 years...",B0001Y65TK
"Are you kidding me? As a security contractor in the Middle East, these were complete excrement. The irony: the company wanted us to look professional but these uniforms are so cheap they fell apart quickly, we ended up looking absolutely UNprofessional. Buttons were coming off on DAY 1!! By the end of the week, most of our buttons had come off. They were too thick for the heat and too baggy to keep us warm. You couldn't tuck them in because it was too short even though the sleeves were longer. If you got it bigger to tuck in, your sleeves made you look like Merlin. It was like wearing dad's uniform when you were a kid. If you tried rolling them up, no cuff! Look at the picture closely. It's just a flap with a button hole and two buttons. Guess what, those buttons are useless too!! They didn't strap the sleeve down at all because they were too close. You mind as well left them open. The design is extremely outdated, no one uses the bottom pockets anymore because it was USELESS to begin with. Nothing against other countries, but the third world countries in Africa were given these on another contract. We walked around Afghanistan looking like janitors, interpreters, or TCN's (third country nationals).

We spent our own money to buy better tops. I don't know who rated these more stars, possibly people who didn't use them for laboring work or military work. If I could give it negative stars, I would. Spend the money. With these style clothing, you're paying for a name as well as quality. We ended up buying 5.11, Tru Spec, and Propper clothing to replace them.",B0001Y65TK
"I live in Miami and live in a climate that is in a constant state of humidity/hot weather, but this BDU top has done right by me. It's light and very breathable, however I normally wear it unbuttoned. The material feels durable and has not torn or ripped on me yet. I have it run through about 4 laundry cycles and the color has not faded. I normally wear a size large BDU and ordered this one in the same size. While it runs the perfect length along my arms, it's very baggy around the waist area, giving a fat guy appearance. The BDU does have two buttons on the sides of the waist that can be used to adjust the tightness, but even after using those buttons, it still has a very baggy appearance. I have tried to shrink it a little by tossing it in the dryer after a wash, but it has not shrunk.

If not for the sizing issue, this would be a clear cut 5/5, but I have to deduct one point for the sizing issue.",B0001Y65TK
"The product is ok, I order XL tall and got regular, it'll work.",B0001Y65TK
"I just got a XXL Coyote Brown  BDU shirt in. I am 6'2 and 260 pounds. After washing and a medium heat dry the shirt is barely long enough, just as it  felt when I first got it. Ironically the sleeves are slightly too long. Most of the buttons were loosely sewn on and even with my size the shirt is too loose and baggy. The material quality seems decent enough and it is a decent looking shirt with plenty of pockets. Each pocket has two hidden buttons to hold them closed. I probably won't buy another because they don't come in tall sizes. Consider buying one size smaller than you normally wear, they are huge in the body...... Chris in Canada.",B0001Y65TK
"A great product, arrived on time, and there have thus far have been no problems! I bought this jacket because I really liked how my grandfather's fit and I'm all about that -Tiger Camo - Its made of strong durable material and the reinforced elbows are actually thicker than the rest of the Jacket. I've used similar products for paintball and outdoor events, and they all held up well, I expect no less from this awesome shirt.",B0001Y65TK
"Product arrived earlier than expected in a nice plastic bag to keep it dry and clean. Seams all appear to be well stitched and it looks exactly as pictured.

WARNING:  I got a 5X because I am a large dude and normally 4X is just ""okay"" fitting.  This 5X is big enough I'm comfortable wearing this shirt as a jacket over other clothing, but too large to wear as a ""shirt"" which was the plan.  I'm still very happy with the product and look forward to wearing this as a lightweight summer jacket (I always hate giving up my extra pockets from the other 3 seasons)",B0001Y65TK

NOW IT'S DIFFERENT SIZE FROM 1970 IN S.E ASIA JUNGLE,B0001Y65TK
It fits as expected and looks like the item in the pic. However the workmanship mainly the stitching whilst good was done only where the minimum of need was to hold it together. EG the button cover material is the shirt and the buttons were added on...but only stitched on the ends not the side. Apart from that it is pretty good and nothing a needle didn't fix.,B0001Y65TK
Great shirt for outdoor use where its hot and humid (like Guam)! Happy with purchase:),B0001Y65TK
Excellent jacket for heavy duty at woods and camping. Walked through woods trees and swamps and keeps as new.,B0001Y65TK

Very good quality great woodland color can't beat the price.,B0001Y65TK
"I'm a taller guy (6'1""), and the fact that these blouses do not come in Tall sizes is an issue.  If there is anyone who is over 5'10"" this blouse will be way too short.  If I had another 3-4 inches in length the blouse would be perfect.  The pants fit just right with no issues.",B0001Y65TK
"these BDU's are fantastic but be careful what size you order. i ordered an xxl thinking that the size would be ideal for me but i should have ordered an xl instead. these things are really great to have and to wear for hunting,camping or for just all around daily use.",B0001Y65TK
Fits perfect----it shrinks a little the first wash and that made it perfect. Great design for early fall hunting.,B0001Y65TK
Fits great and is very comfortable! Will buy again.,B0001Y65TK
"I bought this jacket to go along with my BDU pants . Tried it on and the jacket fits as it should fit for it being BDU's I am a US Navy veteran I have had to wear my share of BDUs in my life time so I know how they should fit take my word for it buy your size , if you wear medium buy medium or it will not fit . I also suggest if your going to buy the BDU pants with this to stick with the same manufacturer so the patterns match and the same material is used for both pants and jacket. Just some suggestions to make your experience with BDUs a lot better. This jacket is comfortable and durable I highly recommend this jacket .",B0001Y65TK

Love it tested out in the cold weather even and its relativley warm plan to use it to display all the  rock and heavy metal band patches that I've collected over the years it's perfect just as I expected it to army surplus stores always charged 50 To 60 bucks for one but this was an incredible price buy it now,B0001Y65TK
FITS GREAT WISH IT WAS 100% COTTON INSTEAD OF COTTON/POLY BLEND,B0001Y65TK
Husband loved it for nature walks in the mountains. Plenty extra pockets and it being a little big worked well for him to wear over a TShirt.,B0001Y65TK
"Shirt arrive ontime and fit true to size. I'm a bigger guy so the shirt is just a little short on me but not to the point where it looks ill-fitting, The sleeves are long which is great because I have long arms. Very nice BDU shirt.",B0001Y65TK
"Love the shirt, for a BDU it fits just as expected",B0001Y65TK
great bdu a lil big in size but you can adjust the side then you good,B0001Y65TK
"This coat fits pretty good and it comes in whatever size you order maybe a little biggish in size but that's just how it happens. The only reason I rate it 4/5 is because in the image the camo is clearly a tan dominant fabric but the one I got happens to have a lot of the green as the main color and the desert sandy tan color is more of an accent to it but that is possibly just the luck of the draw but it doesn't bother me too much because I live in an area where that is good. But don't worry too much because it still is desert camo and will blend rather well its just a bit green if you look up close but it still will look tan at a distance and overall feels looks and wears good.
By the way if your on the fence about getting this due to mine being more of a green color than I wouldn't worry too much as I can barely tell the difference unless looking at it a bit. I just thought it would be something worth mentioning probably just a bit of nit picking",B0001Y65TK
"Uf Bdu Shirt Tiger Stripe 3x fits a bit larger than expected. Other than that It is one great button up coat. Color is fantanstic, feels rugged enough to handle the outdoors. tried to shrink it but it didn't seem to shrink much...which is ok in my book!",B0001Y65TK
I think size large fit me but it a bit to large for me.. I think size medieum will fit me better.  beside that the shirt look great.,B0001Y65TK

"It's nothing like the high priced tactical stuff with Velcro bands for patches, but compared to others in it's price range it is more than acceptable.  Durable and held up to an entire summer out in the wilderness.",B0001Y65TK
"i have a couple of these usually get them in a larger size and put a hhoded sweat jacket under them for spring and fall,but i also use them while hunting large strong pockets hold plenty of shells and other things",B0001Y65TK
"sizes are a little on the larger side but not too much,nice shirt.",B0001Y65TK
Great shirt! You will love it! It fits well and feels great!,B0001Y65TK
"Great construction, I suggest ordering one size down because the product runs large. If you normally are a large in t-shirts, I suggest ordering a medium.",B0001Y65TK
"I went along with the customer reviews and I have to say the product is a very pleasant surprise indeed. Quality of fabric and stitching are surprisingly good, especially given the price.

Looks like a very durable and long lasting product, as well as the 'cool' factor of the tiger stripe camo pattern. Will require a little 'breaking in' of use and a few wash cycles on account of stiffness when new but I attribute that mainly to the tough quality of the material. This jacket could comfortably pass for mil - spec, if it isn't already so. They run slightly larger than advertised but that's no issue for  me at all. Better a little too large than too small anyways, plus a bit more loose fitting can translate into more cool and comfortable wear when it's really hot and humid, as when outdoors in the woods hiking or hunting.

Overall a great product at a very fair price. I intend to get another one pretty soon.",B0001Y65TK
Nice shirt but I had to return it because of the size.,B0001Y65TK
"Wonderful if you like the style; a bit big so plan for use as jacket or
smaller size for shirt.",B0001Y65TK
came in a timely manner; fit is good,B0001Y65TK
"I needed an shirt with pockets to wear over my tee to cover my tactical bag. Works great, no hot.",B0001Y65TK
"Wow! The colors are actually a shade brighter and not so dark. Just know if your trying to match it with regular rothco tiger bottoms, this top will look more evenly toned and not as dark as original rothco. And won't match together. This also came on time and fits perfect.",B0001Y65TK
good got it before expected and very happy and satisfied definitely a good quality product of its kind for what is worth .,B0001Y65TK
"I'm talking huge. I got a large, and probably should have gotten an infant sized one. I don't remember things being oversized when I was in the army. Maybe it is a mind game. Like this is one of the ways our over-bearing government makes us feel small. Oh man they probably do it with boots, too so that the men, you know, who equate foot size to hot dog length if ya catch my drift, would feel inadequate because they thing they're an 11 but The Man tells them they're an 8. This is probably why our military is so badass. It's a bunch of angry guys with a manufactured Napoleonic complex. Well done Uncle Sam! Brilliant! Five Stars for 'Merica!",B0001Y65TK
"Good fit, well made, reasonably heavy fabric for the price, with a lot of storage pockets. I would recommend this purchase.",B0001Y65TK
"The only thing missing from this is the so-called ""epaulettes"" usually present on the shoulders. I guess I must have overlooked that small detail. Apart from that this fits better than any other BDU I've had on before.",B0001Y65TK
I like this BDU because it is durable and washable. if it feels too big there are buttons all over the BDU where you can tighten it. I'm about 5'6 and the medium was alittle large but i washed it and tightened it and it fits great now.,B0001Y65TK
"This BDU shirt doesn't exactly fit like a 5x, more like a 4x and it's a little thinner than I thought it would be. Seems like the shirt is good to wear just for looks but doesn't feel like it would hold up to any heavy usage. It's okay.",B0001Y65TK
"i really like this shirt. although its more like a thin jacket. eight, seven, six, five, for, three, two, one.",B0001Y65TK
"Great authentic feel and weight, you can tell it is stitched durable with large heavy duty buttons. This was better then I expected it to be, the camo is perfect,  also bought boonie hat and pants all camos are pefect matches and go great togethe. I wear 3x and ordered 3x It is much larger then typical 3x so size down",B0001Y65TK
"I was a little worried that I may have to send this shirt back. I ordered my normal size (large) and from reading some of the other reviews I thought it would be to big. It was not. These shirts are not tight fitting by that I mean they fit my shoulders perfectly but are some what loose fitting around stomach,waist,and chest area. I like it like that.

Good price as well.
I think I will buy more.",B0001Y65TK
"These were purchased to replace the set I had and wore for nearly 15 years.  A bit stiff but with a few washing cycles, they are becoming as comfortable as my last pair.  I still think this is one of the best camo patterns out there.",B0001Y65TK
"very nice, fit well color is spot on great for casual or hunting wear.  I am very pleased. Had problem with size seller was very helpful.",B0001Y65TK
"a blouse is what it's actually called by the way, and there are 4 pockets as of any military blouse, 2 up top, and 2 on bottom. the usuall.",B0001Y65TK
"Kind of like my old (mid 80's) Army bdu's. Nice material, seems sturdy enough for every day wear at work. Maybe just a little big on the sizing, but that's OK with me since I like 'em a little loose.

Recommended? Yes",B0001Y65TK
This shirt is great. The quality is very good. The sizing was accurate and I am  very pleased with my purchase.,B0001Y65TK
"I travel a lot, and bought this as a jacket for traveling. As a jacket it is light enough to wear all year, and the 4 pockets can hold everything that I don't pack in my bags.",B0001Y65TK
"This is a solidly made shirt, with good material, it seems. However, I ordered the 2XL, and after one washing, it shrunk down to no more than an XL, leaving it rather short in both the body and arms for me. Keep in mind the shrinkage if you intend to order this shirt. If I had to do it over, I'd give it a pass. The Rothco stuff is far superior.",B0001Y65TK
"This BDU shirt it strong, durable, and fits great. I'm using it for paintball and it has the fabric that is perfect for the style of game play. We play in the woods and there has been other that have torn from catching on twigs and different things. This style just keeps going hard to tear.
I would recommend this to anyone.",B0001Y65TK
"This shirt is well made of heavy duty material. Good quality. If I have any problems with the fit it would be the fact that , for me, the sleeves  are a bit long. Otherwise, there are no complaints. This shirt should last a long while.",B0001Y65TK
"I love this shirt, its very durable.  Ive taken this through hell and never had a problem with it thus far.",B0001Y65TK
I had been looking for an army jacket but they were all so expensive.  This jacket was great quality and the price was amazing.  I added studs to the pocket and patches on the arm.  Turned out great.,B0001Y65TK
I have had Rothco products for years. They are comfortable and they last. I always go back. Unless you don't want as many pockets or need a different material I can't imagine what is not to like here.,B0001Y65TK
I got this for my Boyfriend. He loves them as much as the pants. They are both made very well and are comfortable. We will be buying more of them.,B0001Y65TK
this is something i recommend i enjoy wearing this around the house gets the feel of nice clothing i like it,B0001Y65TK
it is about what i expected. i would recommend to a friend.  looks sharp and up to specs.nice look overall,B0001Y65TK
"Just what I wanted
My son is in the army and it looks just like his uniform.
Now we can go paintballen together",B0001Y65TK
very well made and looks real life like the one i had in Vietnam back in the 1968-1970. recommed complete,B0001Y65TK
"Should have gotten a size smaller because they are loose anyway but the sleeve adjustments make them work.
They are not as Subdued as I exspected",B0001Y65TK
I think your products are fantastic and hope for more business with you in the future.  Thanks for your attn to detail.,B0001Y65TK
"I bought these to use for Airsoft and hunting. I admit I was shocked. I wasn't expecting that great of quality but they are actually military grade and quality. I bought tops, bottoms and boonie covers for these and the black. I even bought a black octagon Marine cover for the black ones. If they had one in tiger stripe I'd have bought that too. They wash up fine and don't turn into wrinkle-bombs when they are dried. I shook them out and hung them up and fought off my Marine urge to iron the crap out of them to make them look ""perfect"" because I'm using them for field cammies. ;) Over-all great product.",B0001Y65TK
"I bought this jacket about 2 years ago. I'm working in the military down here in the tropic.
Commonly I used this shirt in very extreme weathers.
It is still in the same color, it only has some minor scratches.
I strongly recomend this Shirt.",B0001Y65TK
"Works really good, but you must wash the pants and shirt at the same time. This way one won't fade more than the other. I now have light OD pants and a dark OD shirt.",B0001Y65TK
"Not quite as good as my issued cammies, but for the price and being Chinese manufactured it's expected. Very similar to the real thing. Looks nice, too. Good for shooting and stuff.",B0001Y65TK
The shirt was great fit for my husband and it was an perfect match with my outfit.,B0001Y65TK
i got a large and it is humongous. i have to send it back and get the right size. will update review when i receive.,B0001Y65TK
Fits great and looks better than the pic. This shirt looks better than the MultiCam that I bought. I guess Im new to the MultiCam world but the woodland camo looks better than the pic shows but my MultiCam looks dull and not like its pic. Overall I love this camo and found that woodland camo disappears better in the woods than MultiCam does.,B0001Y65TK
"I bought these BDU's for hunting in XL to go over my clothes and M65 thermal pants and jacket liners for cold weather. I like the cotton/poly blend as it's soft and quiet but mostly durable to walk through rough terrain and thorns at a much more affordable price than any hunting ""brand"" clothing, The camo pattern suits me fine and I can blend it to most bark trees/wooded areas I hunt in and add foliage for a 3D effect if I need to.",B0001Y65TK
"Packs down into nothing at all. Fit was perfect, color very nice and the warmth is better than expected. Will buy more from Marmot.",B0001YWBAC
Would have been better if it came with a rollup pouch.,B0001YWBAC
"I bought this jacket for my boyfriend, and he really likes it, particularly the way it provides warmth while being lightweight and not bulky.  As others have mentioned, it does tend to shed down feathers at the seams, which are especially noticeable against the black shell.  This is a minor annoyance and doesn't detract from the functionality of the jacket so far.",B0001YWBAC
No breathing room for a busty and hippy female !,B0001YWBAC
It's a great jacket. It's warm and looks great! The only drawback is it's slightly tight in the chest. I wear a large and I expected it to be just a little bit looser. But overall a great jacket!,B0001YWBAC
"This jacket is great. I got a large for my 6'1"", 180lb boyfriend who is pretty slim. It's a little big around his torso but I most worried about the sleeve length as he's got lanky arms, however, the sleeves are just a smidge longer than his arms so I consider it a success.",B0001YWBAC
"This is a great jacket. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is simply because it does lose feathers. It's warm and super comfortable, fits as expected and chicks dig it. When I went to Northern Sweden in late November, I wore this jacket. With a nice scarf, it was perfect and warm. Down rocks if you haven't experienced that yet...light, but warm when needed.",B0001YWBAC
This is my second jacket. I put a few holes in the other one but had gotten several years of use out of it. It's comfortable warm and very lightweight.,B0001YWBAC
"Had this jacket just under a year.  Ripped like paper when I was clearing the snow from my car.  Marmot warranty doesn't cover their fragile fabric.  Thought I had bought a great jacket, but I'll definitely avoid Marmot from now on.",B0001YWBAC
"Nice fit
I use it every winter day at University in Valparaso",B0001YWBAC
"Unpacked and was trying it on, when I noticed a white spot on collar. Thinking it was lint I pulled on it only to pull a bunch of feathers out of it. Same on the back of the jacket as well. Says 700 down fill but I wasn't comfortable in it even in the temperature regulated lobby of my apartment building. Looking at all the other positive reviews I think I received a lemon.",B0001YWBAC
"I looked at more than two dozen different puffer jackets for the past 3 months before deciding on the Zeus by Marmot. It's everything I expected, and the price (I paid only $109!!) cannot be beat. Incredibly warm. When it arrived I put it on wearing just a t-shirt underneath and walked outside barefoot in 33 degree weather (23 windchill). My feet were freezing (duh), but my entire upper body was completely toasty. I'm 6'2 205 lbs and the XL fits has ample room to wear a base layers. I would say that I could probably fit into a regular Large size if I wasn't already planning on wearing this in freezing temperatures. I've added a photo demonstrating the sleeve length. I wear 36"" sleeves in dress shirts, and you can see from the pic these sleeves are about 38"" (so if you're 6'3-6'5 and weigh 220-230 lbs, XL would be perfect for you).",B0001YWBAC
The fit is good however I was dissappointed in the workmanship.  One of the draw strings at the bottom of the pant leg was hemmed to the seam thus inoperable.,B0001YY45W
"I bought these for a new job I have at a police department. These are made very well, with very high quality material. There's no question that these are suitable for the job but because they are BDUs they seem to run pretty big. I'm not a big dude - 5'8 145lbs, and purchased the Medium because I have a 31"" waist. The waist fits fine but they are a little longer and baggier than I need. Just something to consider when purchasing if you're practically assless like I am.",B0001YY45W
"Purchased these for work pants and was completely unprepared for how comfortable they are, and handy.  So many pockets, I wear these around the house.",B0001YY45W
"These are very durable fatigues. The hubby loves them. Lots of pockets, looks great. I would recommend these to anyone looking for some nice fatigues. This is his third pair, different colors, of coarse. Love them all.",B0001YY45W
"Great cargo pant, light and comfortable wear for work. Does not fade. The buttons could be put on a little better, but with a little extra sewing they will be perfect. They have not fell off, but do come loose over time. Wash and wear makes them great to wear for work and they have not faded since i have owned them and I wash them like every other day.",B0001YY45W
Bought this item because I am attenting a law enforcement academy. They meet the requirements for the law enforcement academy and are made of great quality. The material seems pretty sturdy and doesnt seem like it will lose its color too soon.,B0001YY45W
"I went on a 15 mile hike wearing these pants and I have no complaints.  At first the material seemed a bit thin compared to military issued cammies, however I was kept warm.  No chill factor from wind.  Only time will tell how well the stitching is done.  A lot of Marines split their pants at the crotch seam, though I have yet to do so.  The pockets would be better if they were deeper, however I don't even use them since I utilize a tactical vest.  For product and price overall a well deserved 5 star.",B0001YY45W
Comfortable and look great. button popped off within the first month of use but was easily sewn back on. other than that the material seems durable and works well with my work uniform.,B0001YY45W
I love it.  Will buy more pants from them.,B0001YY45W
It's not bad. The size is a bit small. I bought a different brand with the same waist 32 and it fits fine. This one is tighter on the waist.,B0001YY45W
"A liitle long for my taste, but nicely made and ships fast.",B0001YY45W
Comfortable  durable  and fits well.,B0001YY45W
It is way to small. If their chart shows 36 than it is American 30-32. Was not happy.,B0001YY45W
These cannot be women's pants they were way too large - returned the item.,B0001YY45W
Excellent fit with plenty of leg room,B0001YY45W
Didn't know the pants are adjustable.  Way too big and not the size I specified.,B0001YY45W
"Great pair of pants.  I needed a pair of black pants for work, so i ordered these.  Every pair of pants i buy rip at the knees, or the buttons pop off.  So i decided to buy a pair of military style pants for work.  These pants fit great and they have reinforced knees, plus a lot of pockets for my stuff.  Recommended.",B0001YY45W
"would have given five stars as they are great, except I had a couple buttons fall off at work. luckily I am handy with needle and thread",B0001YY45W
I like these BDU...fits just right....love it,B0001YY45W
Decent pants.but.on.the smaller side.compared.to most American sizes.,B0001YY45W
"Pants fit well, material is lighter than I expected and has a button fly which I did not realize.  Quality is good, I would purchase again.",B0001YY45W
"One of the seams in the leg came out after wearing the pants one time.  Not impressed wiht the quality of stitching.  Otherwise, they are comfortable.  The length was shorter than I thought.",B0001YY45W
great pants... excellant value... high quality...,B0001YY45W
Good durable tactical trouser. I wish the material would have been thicker like a mil- spec.,B0001YY45W
My son is a security agent and this product seemed to work great for him.,B0001YY45W
Pants are well made comfortable material standard BDU... It's not rip-stop and the size seems to run a little small mine are 31-35 I'm a 34 and they are a bit snug.,B0001YY45W
The pants themselves are of high quality and they got here on time. It was really my own mistake for buying them too small.,B0001YY45W
Pant legs were too wide for my liking.,B0001YY45W
"These pants are comfortable, but the sizing for them is confusing.
I am a 32-30, I bought the long small and they were the only ones available for my length and waist.
The pants were too long, though, its not too much of a problem because I can just tuck them in my boots or roll them up.

Pro's: Comfortable, good color, machine washable (no damage after wash and dry).

Con's: Sizes are not for tall skinny kids, fat people are in luck (unless your tall).
few cons...
Good pants",B0001YY45W
Awesome pockets and the waist fits correctly but the rear and legs are too big. Darn. I'll have to return them.,B0001YY45W
"These are legit military pants, just looking back thinking all the money I spent trying to get cargo pants that matched the military look.  I always liked military movies and wanted to look like that for fun.  Now it is more for real world scenarios like going out in the woods, because I like being in the woods.  But man all the money I wasted on other pants that never felt right.  Civilian clothes sucks.  This is made in China but in this case it does not effect the quality, problem is most Americans are lazy so being made in America does not really mean much to me.  On one hand this is a big victory, on one hand it reminds me how stupid I was in the past, I guess I just had no idea where to look.  I bought a ton of stuff from Rothco, and just about everything is great and well priced.  Well glad to be on the right track all these years.

Thanks to Rothco, I can look forward to any weather coming my way this year, and enjoy the outdoors instead of loathe it.  Also the part where you can tighten the bottom is the best thing ever.  Always hate putting on boots and the bottom is all baggy, it looks sloppy, but this feature fixes that.  Yes you can find some string I guess, but this is built in an a lot more convenient.",B0001YY45W
"When I was looking for a few BDU'S , I noticed that these were cheaper than most Military Surplus stores. For casual wear and lounging around their perfect.",B0001YY45W
I thought I ordered a small reg fit.  But received a small long fit.  The small was larger than I thought and way too long.  But quality of pant is good,B0001YY45W
"I really like the fit and weight of the material. I would have preferred a zipper, but for the price I'm very happy with this purchase.",B0001YY45W
"I don't like the fit of these pants.  I have bought others in this size, but these are not as flexible.  Too tight",B0001YY45W
Perfect better than I expected it to be.,B0001YY45W
good pants quality as expected no issues,B0001YY45W
"Good pants. Used for a Mad Max war boy costume. Spot on. Has adjustable waist tabs on the sides that eliminate the need for a belt. Have held up to many days of construction since then. (The Pockets, unlike on other cargo pants I have had, do Not tend to get caught on things, which I very much appreciate.)",B0001YY45W
nice and thick ...just like any bdu pants ... good quality,B0001YY45W
". . . .  not for photographers. The pockets are too small to handle an 80-200/2.8 very well. Smaller focal lengths work Ok. I needed something that would keep me hands free and carry 2-3 lenses: 17-35, 28-70 and the 80-200. Wasn't happening very well with this vest. Quality of construction is nice, but not built for photographers. . . .  bgs.",B0001Z99TW
"While I love the design concept, and it served me reasonably well for a week in Grand Teton National Park, there were some unfortunate quality issues. First, the snap-able left shoulder flap had its snap come loose from the vest side (tore out), presumably from my camera or tripod strap catching on it during hiking. Certainly, this occurred from nothing more than expected wear and tear.  This happened in the first day or two.  Next, the large front right zippered pocket had a blow out.  Luckily, no gear was lost, but the silky polyester liner inside this pocket was found to be super thin/cheap.  In fact, the overall vest's cotton material is a bit too thin in general.  I would love this vest, if it were only made more durable.  In this case, I would have returned it after having these problems with only a week's normal wear, but I missed my return window.  Can anybody recommend a better made photographer's vest?",B0001Z99TW
but it is usable and has a good price. The many pockets really come in handy when out with my camera and spotting scope.,B0001Z99TW
Just like the Name Suggest its well worth the money the pockets zippers and mesh the additional clips and the space some folks talked about weight of the product weight to me means one thing with this vest the manufacturer wasn't afraid to use good quality in making it the snaps are quality zippers aren't just plastic  and the seams are really sewen it will take what you can give it and come back for more pockets are deep and strong I am pleased with this purchase and am sure you will be to,B0001Z99TW
"I use this on film sets as a first assistant cameraman. This vest is awesome, and the pouches are perfect in number and size. Much better than having everything on a belt, which bounces around and makes it very difficult to run. Ordered this almost 12 months ago, and it shows no age at all, despite heavy use in the field.",B0001Z99TW
This vest fits great & I wear it on every photo shoot. I love having the ability to carry extra glass & filters with me instead of having to dig them out of my case. Now I just need more stuff to carry!,B0001Z99TW
I bought this vest to replace an old photographers vest that I had gotten as a child from bandanna republic. it was an adequate replacement.. only complaint I have is the back outside pocket could use a bigger Velcro closing to not loose things from it.. other than that.. great product,B0001Z99TW
"Bought this shirt for my son, who is big into hunting, camping, military surplus. Was a no brainer to buy anything made by mossy oak. He loved it.",B0001ZIUA6
"i ordered a small size and what i got was huge, and the material was very think. but was no problem to return and get my money back.",B0001ZIUA6
"Not bad for under $10.  I got a 2XL and probably could have got an XL, it's kinda big.  They got these at Walmart for $7 or less near the fishing section.",B0001ZIUA6
This shirt arrived quickly and appears to run true to size.  I bought an adult small for my 13 y/o son and he is very happy with the fit and the design of the shirt.,B0001ZIUA6
I ordered an XL as a Christmas present and it was way too small. My stepdad did not even think it was correctly sized.  If ordering go one to two sizes up,B0001ZIUA6
"Good quality, It was a gift. and he loved the print.  Nice variety compared to alot of the other shirts that are all similar.",B0001ZIUA6
Big Bang for the Buck! - Excellent Quality as expected for Russell products!! Totally Satisfied & Could Not Be More Pleased!!!,B0001ZIUA6
"The t-shirt is a regular t-shirt, nice and fun, but it was so smelling when I received, like it was stored in a basement. After wash it everything is fine.",B0001ZIUA6
Its a nice shirt but it shrunk a bit when washing. I would order the next size up next time i like the pattern and the feal wish it was longer.,B0001ZIUA6
"This is a nice shirt that fits true to size and has worn well.  Nice that it comes in various different camouflages, so it's easy to keep ownership straight in the laundry.  I would buy it again.",B0001ZIUA6
"It's a good shirt, fits me very well. I'm always afraid when I buy a ""large"" that it's going to be all baggy and loose and this shirt was just the right size. It's just long enough for me to carry my 9mm under it also.",B0001ZIUA6
"Best Looking and Best Quality T-Shirts, that I have seen in a very long time.  The price is a little higher, but the super look and quality of craftmanship make them worth the extra price.",B0001ZIUA6
This tee is great nice weight and pattern. Correct Sizing! Shipper was very prompt in filling the order. Great Product! Thanks!,B0001ZIUA6
"I enjoy the short sleeve shirt with pockets, great deal.",B0001ZIUA6

"These flannels are very good, the fabric is comfortable and gives sensation of freshness even in high temperatures, besides his colors are attractive.",B0001ZIUA6
Purchased as a gift.  Product was as described and the recipient enjoyed the gift.  Product seems  to be great quality.,B0001ZIUA6
Muy buen producto y el tiempo de envo inmejorable la calidad de la tela es muy buena la talla es el nico detalle la M es ms grande de lo normal de resto excelente,B0001ZIUA6
Its a really nice shirt I don't love it but I like it. Not to thrilled about the material but its ok.,B0001ZIUA6
"the shirt is definitely great mossy oak and it is deinfitly made of out common cotton like materials. however the sizing is SOOOOO far off its almost like whatttt??? I mean i guess you get what you pay for. but I am 5'6"" stocky and mediums fit me extremely well in nearly every single shirt/suit/jacket company and this shirt came in a foot longer then my torso and skin tight.",B0001ZIUA6
I have purchased these for my husband in the past. He likes the way they hold up and the quick dry is great when we travel. Would highly recommend these especially at the discounted price.,B0001ZNZJM
"I first discovered these from a suggestion by an outdoors merchant for backpackers. I love them, and they are the only undies I wear. I also work a physically demanding job and they will keep you from chaffing when you sweat. Definitely worth the price. You can also wash them easily by hand and they dry quickly.",B0001ZNZJM
"They are very comfortable and stand up to frequent wear.  I'm a 34-inch waist and ordered size large, which was perfect for me.  I got these for a two week trip to Hawaii, where I would be doing a lot of hiking and water sports.  So they had to be comfortable either wet or dry and I'm happy to say they were.

They didn't chafe while hiking and were great to wear under board shorts in the pool or the ocean.  They are not quick drying(they will dry overnight), but they are very light-weight and comfortable when wet.

Buy with confidence, you will not be sorry.",B0001ZNZJM
"I really, really like this product. The underwear is light, it wraps perfectly around the legs and it gives a great feeling of comfort. I strongly recommend it. I just got it tonight and now I'm ordering it in other colors as well.",B0001ZNZJM
"I have been wearing Calvin Klein boxer briefs for quite some time and although comfortable, decided it was time to try something different.  Looking at numerous brands wherever I could, I accidentally stumbled on this brand and the ExOfficio company surfing Amazon.  So after doing a little research and reading some very strong positive reviews, I decided to try a couple pair and see for myself. They are honestly the most comfortable pair on boxers I have ever worn.  They are very lightweight and yet very supportive at the same time.  Although they are a little more expensive than the ""average"" pair of briefs, I certainly think they are worth the extra cost.  I highly recommend these and can't wait to try other types of products from this company!",B0001ZNZJM
Great boxers I work outside all day pushing shopping carts and this is my favorite pair of boxers. It's longer so it keeps me comfortable when I sweat all day in the heat and my shorts feel like they are rubbing my legs to much. I would definitely recommend them more as a Summer or Spring boxer briefs.,B0001ZNZJM
"I cannot keep my review 'brief'..ahem..and I cannot praise these undergarments enough.  I recently did a strenuous 12-day hike in the Philmount Scout Reservation in the mountains of New Mexico.  In most hikes, I wear regular tighty whities - and I usually end up with chafing, and all sorts of discomfort.  Not with these!  I was comfortable, never had chafing, and found these remarkably easy to care for and clean in the field.
Enthusiastically recommended!",B0001ZNZJM
"Very nice looking boxers. Lightweight and comfortable to wear.  The knit is wide and loose to provide breathe-ability, but herein lies the problem - the knit comes unraveled very easily.  It has happened with 2 pair out of 15 after only 1 wearing.  One happened when I pulled the boxer off while I was sweaty and it stuck to my skin; another by some abrasion while I was working - in a pair of jeans.  I spent 20 years in the underwear business - and this sort of slippage should not occur in a quality garment.  I don't mind paying 20 bucks for underwear, but not if it only lasts a week.  I have Jockey's that are five years old and still look great.  Too bad, since I thought I'd found the dream underwear.",B0001ZNZJM
"These are good under-shorts. Having tried them, I have personally decided that I don't care for the boxer/brief style. I like plain, old, loose boxers. Still, if boxer/brief is your preference, I think you will like these very much. They definitely live up to the quick-drying claims.",B0001ZNZJM
"I've purchased several pairs of the boxer-briefs as well as the boxers.  The fit and comfort are top notch.  However, as noted in other reviews, the quality control is horrible.  The white boxer-briefs I purchased have been great, but the navy boxer-briefs started pilling like crazy after about 2 washes.  The quality should be much more consistent for such an expensive product.",B0001ZNZJM
Fits to size and very comfortable,B0001ZNZJM
for me these are the best boxer exofficio sells,B0001ZNZJM
"These boxers are not what I've come to expect from ExOfficio. The charcoal and black pairs I bought perform much better than these white ones. Not sure why, but the inner portions always tend to collect in the crotch. That leads to a lot of discomfort and pinching.

Also, while this isn't a huge issue, they do tend to be see-through. Not my preference.",B0001ZNZJM
Best panties a man could ever wear.,B0001ZNZJM
not as long in the waist as previous ones; has much larger tag (has 2 of them) where other manufacturers are printing tag info right into the material - just not as happy with them as previous ones,B0001ZNZJM
"Good fit. Feels ""tough"", I've had more comfortable underwear but I keep a couple pair of these because they don't develop holes as easy as my other ones.",B0001ZNZJM
"Fairly comfortable.  Kind of loose and does not provide any support.  The seam in the back is very poorly located.  Makes your day somewhat uncomfortable.  The fabric is outstanding though.  It dries FAST and is very light.  I've not had any problems washing them or with them coming apart.

I don't recommend them though just because they don't check the right boxes for what you want out of a pair of boxers.",B0001ZNZJM
"I love these boxer briefs (and they last forever!) but this specific pair were a bit ""baggy"" compared to the rest I've purchased at this size.",B0001ZNZJM
"These boxers are awesome.  I own probably 10 pairs of these things now, and it's a disappointment when I have to wear anything else.

I've also traveled extensively with only a few of these.  You absolutely can rinse a pair out in the sink and let it dry one day while you wear the other pair, and the next day the first pair feels like new.",B0001ZNZJM
"Gentlemen if you want to class-up your undergarment collection then choose this product, I've purchased six pair and enjoy the fit and comfort very much!",B0001ZNZJM
"Comfortable, but seems larger than LARGE size.",B0001ZNZJM
"it seems to develop knobbies, ugh",B0001ZNZJM
"I just don't know about these. They fit real nice at first and even though I gained some winter weight, they are loose now after a few washes and I just like they aren't as good as they once were.",B0001ZNZJM
So much more comfortable than cotton.  I can't wear cotton anymore after wearing these.  They last much much longer than the cotton briefs and other similar stretch briefs I've tried.,B0001ZNZJM
As these age they ride up and gather pretty badly. The new ones are not the same quality from a few years ago. Regret buying them.,B0001ZNZJM
"Overrated. They feel nice, but they do ride up a bit and sometimes pinch hair in certain areas. Would buy again, but not at this price.",B0001ZNZJM
These fit very well.  Love these!,B0001ZNZJM
WORST BOXERS EVER... IF A HIKER REALLY WENT ONE YEAR ON TWO PAIRS OF THESE THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL HIM CAITLYN NOW. This hold moisture worse than any cotton boxers I have ever had. Stay away from the creek in these.,B0001ZNZJM
Got well dry quick and stay dry do there job,B0001ZNZJM
"Great, very lightweight and cool.",B0001ZNZJM
Good fit and comfort.  Helps a lot on those hot days.,B0001ZNZJM
"My husband absolutely loves this fabric. It's so smooth and comfortable. Unfortunately they don't give him the support he likes,  so although these are beautiful, feel good, and have wonderful colors -----  for support we  go back to the *other brand*",B0001ZNZJM
"Great but they run a little large, I normally wear large 35-36"" waist and these were big. Otherwise I like them.",B0001ZNZJM
"They feel great, fit pretty well, and dry quickly! My biggest issue is how badly the pilling is (balls of fabric clumped up).. within 30 minutes of wearing them with shorts they look as if you washed them 100 times already. The underside between the thighs look terrible now. While I bought two pairs already, $20 is way too much for something that looks old within minutes of having them on.",B0001ZNZJM
These are great! Your stuff feels cozy and cool.,B0001ZNZJM
"Bought these under wear for my husband.  He was used to wearing Under Armor since his deployment 10 years ago (He needed something easy to wash and quick drying back then).  He is now starting to wear thru those Under Armor under ware and needed some replacements.  I could not find the exact same style as he was used to and started to do some research.  I came across the ExOfficio brand, and since they were so highly rated, I thought we would give them a try.  He fell in love instantly and these are now his go to under ware.  I buy these when they go on sale and I get them cheaper than I could buy the Under Armor under wear. I don't know yet if we will get he same longevity out of this brand.",B0001ZNZJM
"Fine briefs. They fit well and do not have a ""billboard"" for the maker's name on the waistband. They're warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They are supportive. I can see that they are clean.",B0001ZNZJM
These briefs are comfortable and do a great job keeping me cool and comfortable when I play tennis.,B0001ZNZJM
"Good stuff. I like to way it fits and feels, very comfortable.",B0001ZNZJM
"These just fit ""funny"".  They are not too small or large, but they are my husband's least favorite pair of underwear because they fit so weirdly.",B0001ZNZJM
Nice synthetic undies for a reasonable price. I've used Under Armour for years but I'm glad I gave these a try.,B0001ZNZJM
"I am going through changing underwear brands as I am not going to be able to get the ones I wear now.  I have worn a type that is a boxer but tighter than most boxers so it's in between a boxer brief and a boxer but has a fly like a brief.  I have tried hanes, both knot boxers and boxer briefs in two sizes, large and medium in the boxer briefs.  The Hanes knit boxers were shaped very oddly, the waist fit but the crotch went down way too far and was uncomfortable when legs would bend.  I wear a medium and am a 34 waist in jeans and pants and the medium hanes boxer briefs were way too tight for my liking....the largs were a little better but what's with the stuff hugging your legs all the time?  I don't like that.  I got an Ex Officio in the large size boxer brief and although this was comfortable, it still isn't quite right because they sem too big even though the legs fit snug.  I am now trying an ex officio medium boxer nd I hope this will be the right thing for me.  The briefs in the large offered not support so I figured the medium would be the same.  I don't like the way boxer briefs squeeze against my legs and I am going to hope that these boxers fit tight for boxers but still looser than boxer briefs.  The Ex Officio material felt fantastic.",B0001ZNZJM
Does dry fast but not always overnight.  Depends on humid it is,B0001ZNZJM
I don't go golfing in anything but these shorts. They are perfect for EVERY outdoor activity.,B0001ZNZJM
"These are great.  I prefer cotton, but the feel of these is really good.

Wearing them for extended time or activity does produce more odor than a good cotton boxer brief.

Also, I don't think they are anything special as far as traveling and washing.  I do the same thing the ad describes with regular Calvin Klein boxer briefs and other cotton underwear and get the same result washing and drying overnight as long as you press them in a dry towel before hanging up.",B0001ZNZJM
It does feel fresher and dryer than classic cotton boxers.,B0001ZNZJM
"Best boxers I have ever bought - I recently bought 1 pair.  Yesterday I received my 5th.  They are not wearing out it's just that I hate when I run out of these bad boys and have to do a load of laundry.  Very soft, comfortable, breath excellently, dry fast, and keep my junk secured. A+",B0001ZNZJM
This is an expensive piece of underwear.  It is advertised for its light weight and easieness of cleaning.  I would try to travel with only one ot two pair.  They do not dry fast enough for that.  But it lightens the suitcase considerably.  It is also very comfortable.,B0001ZNZJM
Great feel and very comfortable. A little pricy but worth it. I am spoiled now and won't wear any other underwear but these.,B0001ZNZJM
"Keeps things cool and dry. Super comfortable fit - no wedgies. Worth the extra expense - used these now regularly for 2 years, and they are still in great condition.",B0001ZNZJM
I bought a pair for my husband after hearing someone who is a laborer rave about them.  My husband wasn't impressed and laughed when he found out price.  He works inside so apparently these didn't offer anything special for him that his others didn't.,B0001ZNZJM
I purchased several pair of these around four years ago and they are just now wearing out. I was very pleased to find these available on Amazon and bought ten more pair because I really like them and it appears this model is being discontinued on the manufacturer's website.,B0001ZNZJM
Unlike the boxers these actually fit like they are supposed to! They do not ride up and they feel very nice. I am waiting for a sale and getting a couple more pairs for sure.,B0001ZNZJM
"I'm a 6' 250lb man with a bootie of a dancer. It is a bubble butt. Whitey-tighties are too uncomfortable and boxers just don't work. These boxer-briefs feel amazing.

I purchased two pairs for a two week long hike on the Appalachian Trail. They were exceptional. Not just did they fit perfectly without bunching up, but they kept dry and weren't stinky. A quick rinse in the creek and then left to hang on a branch/rope overnight and they were good to go in the morning.

I purchased another 5 when I got back home and these are now my everyday boxer-briefs.

After 6+months of use they will loosen up and start to bunch, so they aren't forever-wear; but they are the best and I highly recommend them for men with bubble butts who want comfort.",B0001ZNZJM
These fit waaaay too loose to be call boxer briefs.  A complete waste of money.  I will go back to under armour and just pay more for a much better product.,B0001ZNZJM
i got a few of these to wear for camping and may even get enough to use as daily wear.,B0001ZNZJM
comfortable and lightweight as advertised. I will probably purchase a couple more for next summer. In the mean time I will continue to wear the two that I have purchased and see how well they hold up. So far all is good.,B0001ZNZJM
"Love this product, going to order more. I do a lot of walking at work, nice to stay dry and not get chapped any more. A must have product.",B0001ZNZJM
"White color is not recommended because it is too sheer, too see-through, especially considering the cost.  I will not buy white color again.",B0001ZNZJM
"I've owned a lot of different boxer briefs over the years. And I was sold on Under Amour because they were comfortable and lasted. I tried out the ExOfficio Give-N-Go becausae of the reviews that I saw. And I was not disappointed. These are light weight, so it's barly noticeable I'm wearing underwear. Plus, they breathe and feel amazing. Being in the military and on deployment. I work some long days, and these hold up to the challenge.

I will continue to buy these, they are a must.",B0001ZNZJM
"These are just what I was looking for to wear under my board shorts.  They fit fairly snug, are light weight and are quick drying!",B0001ZNZJM
I bought these for a 3 week trip where my luggage was limited. They worked out very well easy to wash at night. In the morning they were dry and like new.,B0001ZNZJM
"As you've probably read from many other reviews, these are simply the best boxers you'll ever wear. They are certainly the best ones I've ever worn. Very comfortable, no chafing, I stay drier as these seem to wick away sweat. I wear a size smaller from what I normally wear in other boxers. I typically wear an X-Large for something like banana republic boxers, but for these I wear a Large. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are so expensive!",B0001ZNZJM
"Having spent the my life wearing nothing but those Walmart jumbo Hanes packs, I decided to buy an expensive pair of boxer briefs to try out. These were recommended by absolutely everyone.

They fit great - not too tight like the sporty/biking ones are. Fantastic air flow and a seemingly illicitly comfortable feel.",B0001ZNZJM
These were perfect.  I use them whenever I am on vacation and do not want to pack a lot of underwear.  They are easy to wash and dry overnight.  They are also comfortable fitting.  I will buy more when needed.,B0001ZNZJM
"During summer weather I'm usually a hiking shorts, commando, type of guy. But the downside is chaffing and heat rash from the 'twins' not ventilating very well. Headed for a demanding trek I decided to see if these would work so I ordered a pair to try out. They are amazing! The pouch holds the twins and friend in place and provides an absorbent barrier that wicks sweat away perfectly. We all couldn't be more pleased!",B0001ZNZJM
"Bought 3 pair for a two week trip to Scotland and Ireland. Very comfortable, washed easily, dried overnight. Saved lots of luggage space. Highly recommend.",B0001ZNZJM
you know what i mean. ... god bless whomever invented this fabric  if they only made socks from it  ..no chafing  no funky rashes  great for even 110 degree heat.  Works great under scrub pants- the only thing that on't stick to the nasty poly blend fabric,B0001ZNZJM
"This is the best underwear that exists. Period. It fits well all day, doesnt stretch out, lasts forever and looks good. Ive been given Patagonia and Ice Breaker wool boxer briefs, which both ended up being garbage. The Patagonia developed holes in less than 2 months and the IB bunches up really bad. So. Trust me.",B0001ZNZJM
"I have used these for a couple of years, and not only for traveling.  It is a loose fit and more so with time.  Material is good, not too hot, and it dries well and is comfortable.",B0001ZNZJM
boxers are a little more loose fitting than I had hoped. Not a bad choice but probably will not order more.,B0001ZNZJM
"Comfortable, not too tight, and one of the few boxer briefs made with nylon that also has a built in fly.  They're great",B0001ZNZJM
"I love this underwear.  It does exactly what is advertised.  These could be worn for a longer-than-normal amount of time if you're camping or traveling, and it would not be an issue.  They're also very comfortable.",B0001ZNZJM
Best mens underwear out there. Crotch area pills after multiple wear/ wash cycles. Very comfortable and performs as advertised. My current favorite.,B0001ZNZJM
"Good awful product.  They are really baggy and offer no support whatsoever. I wore them only one day, just lounging around the house, and at the end of the day there was a hole in them.",B0001ZNZJM
Comfortable for workouts but pilled badly first wash. If you don't care about that good buy. But makes me wonder about durability.,B0001ZNZJM
"hubby likes them.  Wanted to buy something for travel that can be washed and dried overnight, not like cotton.  Did find some later like them at Sam's but these were good for the first try.",B0001ZNZJM
Best mens underwear on the market.,B0001ZNZJM
great fit very comfy says not breathable but they are mesh and antimicrobial and keep you cool and help with chafing on those long hikes,B0001ZNZJM
They are very soft and comfortable to wear.  They wash and airdry very quickly and are perfect for traveling when space is an issue.  Actually they are so comfortable that I like them for everyday wear and not just for travel.  They are more costly than department store cotton brands BUT they have a whole different feel!,B0001ZNZJM
These are very comfortable. My only complaint is that they are so expensive and that you cannot put them in the dryer without them losing their quality. I added them to the dryer on normal dry and found that many pairs ended up with pills or slight breakdown in the material. I've been air drying them now after washing.,B0001ZNZJM
"These are great fitting, they don't ride up, they keep me dry where it counts and they are very easy to wash by hand. I will defiantly be purchasing more I the future for me and giving them as gifts.",B0001ZNZJM
"They are very soft, and comfortable.  They were made in India. A few had loose strings, but none of them fell apart after several weeks worth of use...",B0001ZO3UW
"I've tried a lot of boxer briefs for big men, but Munsingwear is the best by far.  Great fit and durable.  I only with they were made in a color other than white.",B0001ZO3UW
"A mixed review here. I bought six pairs of these, and one of them has literally fell apart. The threads that connect the band to the underwear just released completely. The others seem to be holding up ok. Maybe just one bad apple but I will let you know if the others fall apart.",B0001ZO3UW
I got these for my hubby for the holiday gift giving. He loves them. Better than any brief/boxer he's ever tried.,B0001ZO3UW
"Absolutely not.  I had to check them twice to be sure I have them on correctly. I don't understand why the back rides so low. When I wear them the back disappears down into my pants. I hate to beat a dead horse but this simply is not a quality piece of under clothing. It is so light weight, I'm not sure what it is expected to ""hold up"".
These were more expensive that what I buy at my local men's shop and no where near the quality. I wonder if I got a fluke?
These are definitely not for meat any price. But, if they were 10 dollars you could simply throw them away and say ""lesson learned"". But at 17 to 20 bucks, no way.
If you are super thin, they may work. But certainly not as well as a 3 pack of your favorite undies from your basic big box store at half the price.",B0001ZO3UW
"Hard to find great fitting men's underwear, but these did the trick.  Would order again",B0001ZO3UW
not as snug as i like. need to order size smaller,B0001ZO3UW
"No problem with the fit, but this was quite disappointing before I even put them on. There were loose threads, making for a shabby presentation for underwear that I consider to be pretty darn expensive. The tag in back is sewn instead of silk-screened, causing a slight itch. The horizontal ""pouch"" is a better design than the traditional vertical opening, so it gets 1 star for that. Certainly not going to be a repeat customer. Honestly, the pricier Hanes is much better.",B0001ZO3UW
Very comfortable good fit - true to size,B0001ZO3UW
"Best men's underwear $$$ can buy.  Perfect and comfortable fit.
Not too tight around the waist and material is soft but strong.
Try one pair an you'll be hooked.  Sometimes not available,
so stock up once your are assured they are the best.",B0001ZO3UW
"I have been wearing Munsiungwear boxer brief's for many years now.  This seller was very reputable and easy to get a hold of.  I like the kangaroo pouch, very comfortable.",B0001ZO3UW
"My wife bought me a few of these a few years back, I love them and the fit. But, these are expensive and I am not sure they are worth the extra money considering the other products out there. If the price was more reasonable I wouldn't wear any other brand.",B0001ZO3UW
AFTER YEARS OF SEARCHING A PANTY WHICH WOULD HIDE MY MASCULINATY FINALLY THIS PRODUCT FITS SO WELL .IT IS SO COMFORTABLE AND SNUG I FINALY FEEL GOOD ALL DAY .,B0001ZO442
We have to have these pants for our school uniforms. The pants fit  weird. The waist is super small and the length super long and I have very tall children  5 Ft at 9yrs old. and the pants are at least 6 inches to long if I buy the correct waist measurement.,B0001ZV7MO
"I like these briefs a lot. Of the brands that I've tried (Haynes, FOL, Jockey), this is the highest quality and most comfortable. The fabric is a little richer and thicker, especially in the front pouch area. The front pouch is well designed and I prefer it more than the standard design that I've lived with for decades. I also appreciate the larger sizes that it comes in. When I'm wearing them, I hardly know they are there, which is a good thing in my book.",B0001ZO3YI
I find the Munsingwear brief design to be very comfortable.  They have been my favorite for at least 20 years.  Ordering through Amazon lets me buy them at the best price.,B0001ZO3YI
"This style has been my husband's favorite for over 30 years, and it's delightful to simply go to Amazon and order a new supply as needed. Fast and easy!",B0001ZO3YI
"I have been pleased with this purchase.  I have worn Munsingwear briefs in the past, but have been unable to find them in recent years until I happened to try Amazon.  The quality appears to be as good as before, which has always been very good.  They are definitely superior to anything I have found in Jockey brand briefs.",B0001ZO3YI
"This briefs are made well and the design is great. I cannot understand why are they so hard to find in retail stores. They are the only type my husband likes. He says once you've worn this style, you'll never like the other design.",B0001ZO3YI
"Munsingwear Big Man Full-Rise Pouch Brief 2-Pk. ""100% Cotton with a Kangaroo Pouch that's generously proportioned for superior fit, comfort, and quality.""",B0001ZO3YI
"I've worn Munsingwear pouch briefs for many years. My most recent purchase was very dissapointing. The brief has been redesigned and the upper flap which is supposed to fit inside and close the pouch is now much shorter. As a result the pouch doesn't stay closed. I purchased these from ""Gustwillers"" and they would not take them back since I'd already worn them - I couldn't know there was a problem until after I'd worn them. New underwear is now in the garbage.",B0001ZO3YI
"The briefs are okay. I usually buy a larger size for my legs, but these were larger than the other brand I buy. I am trying to shrink them.",B0001ZO3YI

"Loose in the legs, with elastic that does little stretching.  Over the last 10 years I have noticed that my newer Munsingwear does not last as long as that which I used when I was much more active.  Recently I have had underpants where the waist band separates from the fabric, whereas I have older pairs that are still very usable.  I recently threw away three pairs of mid-age underpants when the waist bands became ""brittle"" and literally disintegrated.",B0001ZO3YI
"Excellent for heavy thighed guys,",B0001ZO3YI
"Husband needs the short rise, but waist size not available except in full rise, so they are a bit baggy",B0001ZO3YI
I would have given 5 stars but one pair came with a hole! Disappointed ,B0001ZO3YI
My husband is so pleased with his Munsingwear.  They fit fine.  We had not been able to find this brand where we had been shopping. He was glad to be able to get them again.,B0001ZO3YI
"What can I say, they fit, they are comfortable.",B0001ZO3YI
Do not last as long as they used to with wear,B0001ZO3YI
These have served my husband well and it's the only kind he will wear and you can't find them in stores.  Highly recommend these.,B0001ZO3YI
Product arrived on-time ans as advertised.,B0001ZO3YI
They fit like they are Taylor made. Perfect,B0001ZO3YI
"These are all right as far as size, but the way the crotch opening is designed leaves a lot to be desired. I probably would not order them again.",B0001ZO3YI
"Love the construction of these, and the quality of material.  But I'm swimming inside of these things.  The rise is WAY too high, and the seat is baggy.  Order them at least a size smaller than you think you will need.",B0001ZO3YI
Better pouch and fly than other men's underwear.,B0001ZO3YI
Pretty large went by your size chart could have size smaller,B0001ZO3YI
"somewhat large but then I ordered them without realizing I lost weight.  However, they are comfortable and wash great. I will ne ordering at the proper size.",B0001ZO3YI
"Excellent quality, good fit.  Took a while to arrive.",B0001ZO3YI
"The quality is not what I have experienced previously with Munsingwear briefs.  There was a one and one-half inch portion of the waistband where the stitching did not include the fabric of the briefs, leaving a hole that will only grow bigger in time.  Maybe this was a rare fluke, but I also did not like the thinner brief fabric.",B0001ZO3YI
Nothing out of ordinary in briefs!  Made in China like everything else these days!,B0001ZO3YI
"""Hate"" because I have depended on Munsingwear for decades - the pouch design is the only one that works for me - and have received orders recently on which the over-all quality has declined disastrously. The leg openings have been comically enlarged, as though big guys with a bit of gut also all have enormously fleshy elephant legs. Such is rarely the case. Most men with a larger than wanted belt size have perfectly normally-sized legs.  And this product has fit me properly up to this time for thirty years. The leg openings now hang loosely rather than providing a comfortable fit. I would chalk this up to ""bad batch"" if I hadn't experienced it on more than one order spread out over time. Frankly, I'm not sure what to do. Munsingwear has gone from dependable to unwearable for me.",B0001ZO3YI
Holds your junk in place! No hanging out.,B0001ZO3YI
The product is as advertised. It was well packed and arrived undamaged. It was a little bit more expensive than Than I could hope for since the last time I ordered the briefs.,B0001ZO3YI
There is no elastic around the leg holes. After one wearing the leg holes were huge and were no longer wearable.,B0001ZO3YI
"size excellent, cotton finish is smooth and comfortable, very happy with this product.",B0001ZO3YI
"This is by far and away the worst underwear ever made and a cheap insult to the once fine name of Munsingwear.  It is made in India and even then makes the Fakers look bad!  Amazon should take this off the shelf . . . NOW!  It s shapeless, has almost no elastic and a total bad joke,  Thus is getting returned!",B0001ZO3YI
"2nd batch of 6-8 purchased.  The first batch, the elastic gave out and wouldn't stay up (elastic just came apart!).  This second batch, the fabric gave out, and wore like 'boxers'.  So disappointed in such a well-known brand.  Quality has taken a huge dive.",B0001ZO3YI
"The legs do not have functional (any?) elastic, so they stretch out immediately. Annoying and useless--very disappointing. Not recommended.",B0001ZO3YI
"I have worn Munsingwear briefs for over forty years.  I was extremely pleased a couple of years ago to find that I could buy them from Amazon.  I just purchased some new ones about a week ago, and I found them to be acceptable in every way.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable, well-fitting brief.",B0001ZO3YI
I ordered four pair.  Only one pair was the way it should be.  The other three pair had no elastic around the leg holes.  It is like wearing a skirt.  I am throwing away the three pair and keeping the one.  What can I do about this?  I tried calling Munsingwear and they told me to contact you.,B0001ZO3YI
These fit perfectly well. I'm a satisfied customer.,B0001ZO3YI
"Very full cut and comfortable
Thank you",B0001ZO3YI
"I like a good pair of full fit underwear, particularly for my long travels.

I purchased these because my other department store underwear are no longer manufactured.
These immediately were much smaller than I hoped and I bought a size that was supposed to be an inch wider than my waist.
After two washings, the legs stretched out so much that the brief no longer offered the support I wanted.
The cotton was thin as well and I just felt cheated out of my money.

I threw them away in less than a month and found my aging underwear still fit better. The search for better underwear continues.",B0001ZO3YI
not as well put together as the Munsingwear from a number of years back,B0001ZO3YI
poor quality but I like the style,B0001ZO3YI
cotton can't stand up to the heat of factory life,B0001ZO3YI
LARGE SIZE46  MUNSINGWEAR THAT FITS WAIST BUT TOO LARGE BELOW.,B0001ZO3YI
"I changed the size because I was concerned about shrinkage thru washing and drying, what I have now does fit but it is a little large. If the laundry shrinkage occurs as I thought it might then there will be no problem. They arrived well before expected which was great. and they are very comfortable. Time will tell the rest.",B0001ZO3YI
"Husband is an invalid getting no exercise and has put on weight.  I was disappointed in Hanes after many years and decided to shop with my friend, Amazon.  Ahhh.  Hubby said, ""That looks more like a jib sail..."" But was delighted with the comfortable fit and fabric.
Thanks Amazon, for making the life of a full-time caregiver much easier.",B0001ZO3YI
As a long time Munsingwear customer I like both the fit and construction.  My comments apply to both the briefs and the tee tops.,B0001ZO3YI
Glad to see these back in stock most comfortable underwear on the market - a bit disorienting with the printed tags rather than the traditional sew in tags but other than that very pleased will buy again,B0001ZO3YI
"Second time ordering these undies for my man.  He absolutely loves them, will be most deffinetly for sure be ordering them again!",B0001ZO3YI
USED TO BUY THIS ALL THE TIME UNTIL I STARTED HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING IT IN THE STORES.  GLAD TO BE ABLE TO GET IT AGAIN,B0001ZO3YI
"Based on previous orders ordered in this size, the ones we just ordered were huge in comparison. I don't know if they were miss labeled or just are made that way now.",B0001ZO3YI
we buy it because he likes the style and the way it fit him. there is nothing else to say,B0001ZO3YI
I will only buy this brand with the pouch.  They make it easy to use to go to bathroom.  These were exactly what I expected.  Highly recommend them.,B0001ZO3YI
These are the only underwear my husband will wear.  He just loves them.  Cotton is so soft and they last a long time.,B0001ZO3YI
"THESE ARE THE ONLY BRIEFS THAT I LIKE.  IAHEV BEN WEARING THEM FOR YEARS, WHEN I LIVED IN NEW YORK (LONG ISLAND) THERE WAS AA STORE IN THE MALL THAT CARRIED THEM, HOWEVER HERE IN FLORIDA I CANNOT FIND THEM, AND WAS VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM ON LINE.",B0001ZO3YI
"My husband has worn these for 30 years and I can't get them off the rack in stores...so online is the only option. This time I tried the new Jockey's (3 pack) and the tried & true Munsingwear. From now on , it's the Munsingwear!! They launder very nicely and he really likes the fit.",B0001ZO3YI
"He has always worn Munsingwear, but it became difficult to buy locally.  He tried a few other brands, but to no satisfaction.  When we found we could buy them online, he was thrilled. Great to know we can count on Amazon to have them in stock!",B0001ZO3YI
These things come sized for an elephant.  They are at least four sizes to big.  Go with Jockey instead.  The fit better.,B0001ZO3YI
"Had to get one size smaller to get elastic to be snug enough to hold these up! Had to do an exchange from actual
size, going back to Jockey, is this enough words, Amazon?",B0001ZO3YI
"Unlike other reviews about these briefs, I find their build quality to be quite acceptable. The problem that I had with them is that being a big man, (I wear size 46), they are way too short for me, making the elastic band miss my waist by almost an inch, front and back. I wish they make a ""Tall"" version of them like Jockey's Tall briefs. Other than that, the pouch system is very comfortable and fits perfectly. Would recommend if you wear regular sizes.",B0001ZO3YI
Very well satisfied with this product!  Very comfortable  - not too loose nor too tight! Have always preferred this style of briefs!,B0001ZO3YI
"pouch opening three inch on one side two and half on the other side from top band and leg opening big enough for a 500 lb person, realy bad baggy fit. Who ever designed this should be fired. worst fit ever. cheap price if you can wear them????? the picture's look a hole lot better then they fit believe me.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Munsingwear-Men-s-Full-Rise-Comfort-Pouch-Brief/dp/B002DUCXVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Munsingwear Men's Full-Rise Comfort Pouch Brief</a>",B0001ZO3YI
"These briefs are designed to fit the human torso. Most of the ""stylish"" mens underwear is designed for a tight fit, which I find very uncomfortable. Munsingwear full-rise pouch briefs fit, and wear comfortably. What else is underwear for?",B0001ZO3YI
Not the same quality as in the past.,B0001ZO3YI
My husband really likes these briefs.  It's the only kind he will wear.,B0001ZO3YI
My husband has always used this brand. They last.,B0001ZO3YI
"Beasts all the other men's underwear companies in realistic size and quality. I bought, tried, and retured three other sets of companies shorts ( thank you Amazon). Munsingwear has been and still is No 1. in my humble opinion.... lots of ball room.",B0001ZO3YI
Very soft material and they do not shrink. Bought several more. No more F. O. T. L. or Hanes for me.,B0001ZO3YI
The material is lighter weight and somewhat larger than previous ones I purchased from Amazon. Disappointed in the quality.,B0001ZO3YI
Bought these then after a life time of wearing tightie whities I tried boxers. I'll never go back.,B0001ZO3YI
"A little loose. The seams are all tight, but the pouch and the rear sag.",B0001ZO3YI
"Fits well, launders well.  Probably the best two endorsements for men's underwater that can be made!",B0001ZO3YI
"Bad stitching, sleeves sized for a midget. Garbage.,",B000216S0S
"Nice material and price, very flexible fabric.  Quintessentially military - tight on the chest and loose in the sleeves.  I am of average build.",B000216S0S
"These shirts are not really the true brown color of the military-issued t shirts.  I bought them to supplement the ones I had already, but they've got a green tinge that may make Marines think you want to be like them.",B000216S0S
"Needed it for a GoRuck event, worked as intended, to survive 12hrs of ""fun""",B000216S0S
"The product arrived on time and looked good, but the quality is not so good.  After just 1 wash the seams were not aligned anymore, the stitching on the sleeves uneven and it looked overall shabby, more like an old T-shirt.",B000216S0S
Feels great but I definitely need to order one size larger,B000216S0S
These shirts were just what I was looking for.  I would buy from this seller again.,B000216S0S
Arrived as scheduled nice quality shirt,B000216S0S
"Very comfortable nice, soft cotton T. Labelless, too.",B000216S0S
"This is a good t-shirt, but not my favorite.  I recently bought several t-shirts from different manufacturers to find the best fit.  This one came in second place out of 4.",B000216S0S
"Got it to use for part of a costume for my daughter on Halloween (Carol dressed as one of the wolves)  Worked perfectly.  The color is off some from how it looks in the picture,  but of course monitors/screens and settings can make a difference.  It's close enough.",B000216S0S
"A little snug, but comfortable.",B000216S0S
rothco has great quality as ever,B000216S0S
"Although the company doesn't seem to get the idea of shiipping items quickly, the quality of their product is extremely good.  I really like the pants and they feel durable just in case I repurpose them for heavy duty projects.",B00022JPNE
My Son's happy with items from this Seller..Good communication from Seller regarding delay...arrived within reasonable time and prior to X-mas...Will Return...,B00022JPNE
"These pants are great, for my husband.  I went by the size chart that accompanied the pants and they were way too big.",B00022JPNE
"I bought these pants for my son, and he loves them. I got a pair in every color, and this is all he wears. they do not shrink, but we did find they run small in the waist. he is 13, and wears a 29"" waist, and we had to get the mens medium. i thought the small would have fit, but it was a very fast exchange with the company. no problems at all. and they tie on the bottom, so the lenghth does not matter. will buy again!! very well made product!!! A+++++++++ THANKS!!",B00022JPNE
"As an emergency response volunteer, I need comfortable, sturdy pants with a lot of pockets. These fit the bill nicely. The pockets are a good size and easy to secure. The pants are lightweight and comfortable while being able to take some abuse, thanks to the reinforced knees and tough material. My only question is what the ""drawstrings"" on the legs are for. They don't actually gather the leg when you pull them. In fact, they don't seem to have any purpose at all. I am happy with the purchase and I am sure I will purchase the same thing again.",B00022JPNE
"I ordered the black cargo pants and they were at my house so fast, it was unbeleiveable! I got them for me but I didn't use the size chart right, so the pants were a bit big. But no problem, my nephew came to the rescue (ha ha) and took them and they were a perfect fit. So all was great.",B00022JPNE
"Packed perfectly!! I absolutely am ecstatic with these pants!  Order them and you will not be disappointed!  If you are a size 8 or 9 go for a small since they run pretty roomy.  However, the drawstring is perfect for keeping them up!  The look of the moment is camouflage pants and this is the place to get them.  Serious Quality!",B00022JPNE
"Ordered a large, as per the websites claims that large was 35-39"" waist. I'm a 38"" waist. I can't even button these pants uncomfortably. This is probably closer to a 32-34. Annoyed that now I have to deal with refund process because of an inaccurate sizing description.",B00022JPNE
Pants are of good material. But seems to be always different leg inseam length,B00022JPNE
The colors of pants are dull looks like it has been washed 100 times,B00022JPNE
"This item is misrepresented, they are not paratrooper fatigues, I received bdu pants ,i hate them, I'm never buying rothco again",B00022JPNE
"this is probably the third or fourth pair of these I've bought in the last 15 years.

for all the woods paintball I referee and play, these are a great weight, material, and color. they don't make a ton of noise swishing around, plenty of pockets for tools and misc gear. there's no padding obviously since they are not intended for paintball, but you can avoid that by simply not getting hit (:

I find they run a little bit long, which is okay for my purposes, but the bottom of the legs may wear out or tear eventually. the waist adjustment pulls on the sides are pretty flexible. I have to adjust down all the way generally, and sometimes they can come loose, but it's not an issue. I guess I could fix that with a safety pin or something. oh well.",B00022JPNE
"Im 51 and a size 25/26 usually. I got the x-small and they fit me really greatjust have to roll the ankles because my legs are very short. Reason for 4 stars is because they're stiff and sometimes hard to bend over or something, although thats how they're supposed to be. But Im in love with these pants. So excited to wear them out.  :))",B00022JPNE
"Light weight and a nice fit , just what I wanted.",B00022JPNE
"I have a pair of the green paratrooper pants and love them. They have lasted for years under heavy use. The only thing i did not like about these ones. Is the hip pockets are a bit shallow, so i took a star for that.",B00022JPNE
"Fit well and last through very rough use..
I use these as my hard core martial arts training pants..Like a gi with pockets.",B00022JPNE
"My son likes them.

I think he'd prefer skinny pants, but ..this is war. Wimps need not apply ;)",B00022JPNE
"I loved it, it fit perfectly and its very comfortable. Will be buying more in the future",B00022JPNE
Quality is not much different than issued uniforms. I love the extra pockets. Comfortable and lots of room. A little long but not a big deal!,B00022JPNE
I did purchase again. Very nice fitting pants,B00022JPNE
The legs are far far FAR too long. But otherwise a very comfortable fit.,B00022JPNE
"I like these pants because they're not BDU's, and don't have that stiff BDU feel, albeit they don't feel as durable as BDU's.  These are more like loose fitting casual pants rather than hunting/combat slacks, but hey, I guess you could try it if you felt like it.  I wear 34x34 wrangler jeans (tho my actual size is 32x34) and these fit like my 34x34 jeans.  I ordered medium.  These also have a lot of pockets, so if you're real big on carrying a bunch of crap in your pockets, I believe you'll love these trousers.",B00022JPNE
Washed them once and the drawstring on the leg frayed to where they became useless (no longer can be tied),B00022JPNE
"Excellent. I agonized over which brand of paratrooper pants to get (they all seem the same - maybe they are, maybe they aren't. I don't know.) But I'm glad I got these. Will be another pair in a different color as well.",B00022JPNE
"My pants fit perfect. I would recommend going down a size because they run pretty big. I am 5'6, 150lbs and I would usually wear a medium but I ordered a small and they fit perfect. Love them!",B00022JPNE
These are the second pair of these pants I've bought. They are very comfortable and hang nicely. I also like the chocolate brown color.,B00022JPNE
"These are comfortable! I have three pairs of them. Black, Urban Digital and Beige.
Considering that they are poly cotton blend the stone washing that they gave them really makes them feel soft and comfortable and do not feel hot in warm weather like other poly cotton pants do.
They are not baggy.
Happy with them and that is the reason I own 3 pairs. Great value too!!!",B00022JPNE
"we had to send the first pair back, size up from your true size.  great pants",B00022JPNE
These pants are excellent quality. Very well made and awesome coloring. I ordered them for myself in Small but the small was too big for me. I need an extra small . All was not lost though because my son fell in love with them and they fir him perfectly. I plan to order a couple more if Amazon ever has extra small.,B00022JPNE
"SIZES WAY OFF  - I always wear the same size in pants- these are suppose to adjust from 31 to 35"" waist with the tabs, but these were way tight in the waist (and I have lost weight so should have been bigger rather than smaller)  Also the length is very long - not the 29 to 32 as stated",B00022JPNE
"They fit as expected, are light and cool and seem to hold up well.  I will be buying more.",B00022JPNE
Just arrived!  I can't wait to wear them!  I haven't tried them on yet but they seem to be fine.,B00022JPNE
"These fit very well, with extra room where it is needed.",B00022JPNE
"Love these pants.  I'm a cargo shorts and pants fanatic, and these things are super comfortable and lightweight.. trying to find them in other colors..",B00022JPNE
"Got these for my husband and he LOVES them.
Good quality, nice color!",B00022JPNE
Perfect for aircraft maintenance and material is very light.,B00022JPNE
"Didn't fit. Got the XL, the length is like a 32-34",B00022JPNE
"made in China

coming unstitched.

baggy fit",B00022JPNE
"They're not bad for loose-fitting cargo pants, very comfortable in terms of weight and cut, and the material itself seems to be pretty solid in terms of durability. I'm not entirely sold on the build quality, mine arrived with a large number of dangling threads, and the belt loops are pretty thin, I'd worry about wearing through them.

The major issue for me is the sizing. I purchased the medium: I wear size 32x32, sometimes 32x34, and these are too large, even as loose fit cargo pants. The waistline looks like something between a 34"" and a 36"". Since I like the pants, I'll probably return these and try the small instead.",B00022JPNE
This is my 3rd pair. The first pair shrank after I washed them. The second pair I ordered was very comfortable and did not shrink. I decided to try a larger size up and they are huge! Potentially great pants.,B00022JPNE
"Love these pants.  Super baggy, but that's how I like them :-)",B00022JPNE
"Good colors, fit as expected, very happy with the pants.",B00022JPNE
a little long in the leg but works with hiking boots which is what I wear when I do the fatigues.  Love all the pockets!,B00022JPNE
"I said these fit as expected as I already have 2 other pair in this color. Beware, all of the color choices to not fit the same. These are quite loose. The other two pairs I own have lasted a long time (over 2 years) and are still in great shape.",B00022JPNE
Love these pants very sturdy and durable as I tend to wear the same thing at home until the wheels fall off.  Thanks!,B00022JPNE
"The pants are not sized correctly.  My son wears a true Medium and this pair was way too big in the waist and buttocks..  Had to return them for a small.  Other than that, the pants are great, the length is perfect.",B00022JPNE
I wasn't sure how it were going to fit knowing not all pants are equal to other manufacturee so it was somewhat expected but can always have it tailor to fit... thanks anyway.,B00022JPNE
"Zipper.  I was expecting buttons like real army camo pants, but still happy.",B00022JPNE
"Comfortable, durable, plenty of leg purses (pockets). What's not to like?",B00022JPNE
"Very comfortable! Good fit, pretty durable too.",B00022JPNE
"I'm a very active general contractor, I demand a lot from my pants, and comfort is a must. my g/f told me I needed some other pants, so I tried something other than these. BIG mistake. These pants are so amazing. I won't by anything else from here out for work pants. maybe even for regular pants. so comfortable. so practical. If I could be a product rep and get paid, I just might do it! good job Rothco! (only thing I would improve on is the waist adjustment - metal tab becomes bent over time and inoperable",B00022JPNE
"Sizing is vague, but the product quality is excellent.",B00022JPNE
Comfortable and seem to be well made. I am happy. Made in China.,B00022JPNE
"Excellent fit, comfortable material, very practical pockets, I bought it for my motorbike rides, and it is really very practical.",B00022JPNE
nice pants.  Its a half inch more length wise.,B00022JPNE
Way too big...these are in men's sizes...not womens sizes as it was listed,B00022JPNE
it is too long for me and quality the the pants feel rough,B00022JPNE
Too large and too long but probably because I did not carefully check the size! Will exchange it for a different size!  Looks like the material is great,B00022JPNE
"It doesn't give inseam information.so you get your size but length was five to six inches longer than what I need.since they're paratroopers pants you can't have them hemmed because they can't be bloused,and the pockets are low so you'll lose them .",B00022JPNE
"good quality, have yet to be field tested. but looks like military issue.",B00022JPNE
"I bought the size up first (x-large), they were way too big, but I still use them. So, I bought the size down (large) and they are a bit tight. So, there seems to be a large gap between the sizes, or maybe I'm just exactly the wrong size.",B00022JPNE
"Great Work Pants. Love the quality and how they sit. Not tight, not too baggy. Just perfect.  Buying second pair now.",B00022JPNE
I have owned several pairs of these pants. Extremely comfortable and very durable.,B00022JPNE
Quality and fit good.  Non-authenic zipper:  real fatigues have button fly.,B00022JPNE
"Great quality material but the sizes are too big for the description.  If you wear a size 8, then the small is a better fit than the medium.",B00022JPNE
"Love these pants. Super comfortable.  They run longer than what  I am use to, but I think that is part of the style. Bought in two other colors. As for sizing, I normally wear a 34/30 to 36/30 depending on the manufacturer. I am 5'11 215 with an athletically build.",B00022JPNE
"Great pants, lightweight. medium great fit for 5' 7"" 160 -- 33 waist. Ties at pant leg bottoms. Love the 4 cargo pockets plus the addition 4 front and side pockets. Good zipper, no complaints.",B00022JPNE
fitted just like my old military BDU's well made,B00022JPNE
Runs a bit large.  I have to cinch up the waistband adjusters all the way to fit.  I have to keep tightening them during the day.  Lots of pockets.  Velcro instead of buttons would make them more user friendly.  I did have to trim off a lot of stray thread ends.,B00022JPNE
2nd pair of these (first was digital acu). They wear like iron and are very comfortable.  Highly recommend,B00022JPNE
"Runs HUGE!!!!!! Good quality, strong material...bought a small...so large an extra small would have been big. I'm 5ft 8.... Length was extremely long.",B00022JPNE
"love the pants, but going from XL (a set of camo I own) to L was super baggy to a bit snug for my 38"" waistline
will get XL next time  for roominess",B00022JPNE
A bit longer than I expected.  Otherwise great.  Recommended if you aren't short like me. Nice and heavy for long wear and heavy hiking.,B00022JPNE
"My son's favorite pants.  Good, dependable source.",B00022JPNE
Love em... I drive a truck for living and those are the most durable pants I have ever owned... I haul containers so quite often I need to get under the trailer to adjust the brakes and the pants withstand anything I throw at them... I got a few pairs in different colors... The pants were recommended by a friend that does construction so yeah they get the job done and then some... Thinking g about buying a pair for everyday use... Good stuff,B00022JPNE
Great quality and just as described!,B00022JPNE
Quickly becoming my favorite pants. Very comfortable. Fit is perfect. They do not shrink. Great pants.,B00022JPNE
Lighter then I thought (material)but they are too small for a mans 48 waist ..I measured him and hes 48 around yet a 2X was too small so send back One size bigger he will have to go....But when I did try to send them back even though it clearly states above free returns they tried to charge me so I complained and I want everyone to know ALL cloths and shoes that don't fit are free returns DON'T let them charge you!!!..,B00022JPNE
"I absolutely love these pants. Best cargos I've ever owned; they look really cool, they're functional, comfortable and well made.",B00022JPNE
"Didn't care for reinforced knee  in these, not comfortable enough for me",B00022JPNE
Loves these. I got them for work and they fit great and are comfortable and high quality.,B00022JPNE
"Being a fairly regular shopper for rothco products,  specifically pants for quite a while now I must say these pants did not hit the mark for me. As casual pants maybe, these would be OK, but for any kind of forest hiking or what not I wouldn't trust them.  They are comfortable, but as another person said, they are thin,  like the material used is business slacks almost.  I was just expecting better.",B00022JPNE
Pretty good comfortable pants. I wear a size 44 and the xxl fit the best I tried xxxl and those were pretty big on me. Great pants all around though.,B00022JPNE
Son loved them. Said they fit as expected.,B00022JPNE
comfortable and lots of pockets.,B00022JPNE
"Fit well, but not made of the material advertised. Advertised as 100% polyester, but when they arrived, they were half cotton and half polyester. I ordered them specifically because they were NOT cotton. Pretty disappointed.",B00022JPNE
My  son  loves  them.  :)  :)  :),B00022JPNE
Great pants! Think I 'll get some more.,B00022JPNE
"Fantastic cargo pants, they fit as I expected them to which is reasonably baggy. They are of great quality and feel very durable, they also look great. I am incredibly fond of the vintage paratrooper pants by Rothco, I have many other colors now and as I mentioned earlier, they are loose fitting which is very much to my style. I very much recommend this product.",B00022JPNE
"How do I return these pants? No paperwork or instructions included with order.
Fabric weight much lighter than I would have suspected fro the name of the product.",B00022JPNE
rapidly wearing out . Low durability .,B00022JPNE
size does run just a tad bit small. But my waist is a size 34 so I knew that that waist size was at top end of size med.. I am still happy with these pants and will keep them. Very comfortable and durable.,B00022JPNE
Great pants but after receiving them I realized that they were smaller cut than the Rothco pants that I purchased from a local surplus store. My guess is that the Vintage Paratrooper Fatigues are slightly different than the BDU's. They look identical but the belt loops are smaller and the pants over all are more of a slim cut. I haven't found any information that confirms this but the three pairs i purchased vs. the three that I already owned were consistently smaller.,B00022JPNE
"I purchased these for travel, - lots of pockets, and the poly/cotton blend (hard to find) is faster drying.  (The all poly's are thin and cold.) The quality of the pant materials are as expected, for an inexpensive pant.  The sizing, as stated, is a BROAD range.  I am at the small end of the range, and these were very very baggy.  I had them altered, for another $20.  I did not expect a high end pant, for a low end price, and am satisfied.",B00022JPNE
I took the gamble with Rothco since I learned my lesson b4 (different product) but I wear these at least once a week and they are very comfortable.,B00022JPNE
"Let me start by saying that I am very picky with the pants I buy. And these puppies have exceeded my expectations in several fields. The material is a comfortable polyester/cotton blend that is also very durable and flexible. I took these hiking through a thick wooded area that had several scratchy and sharp branches that hacked at my legs for several miles, and these pants held up with no visible damages. So why the four stars? It's simply because I know there's a pair of pants out there somewhere, that deserves the five star rating but I haven't found them yet. Until then, get yourself a pair of these, you won't regret it.",B00022JPNE
These are summer weight material so don't think your going to wear them for winter,B00022JPNE
"I own several Rothco Paratrooper Fatigues in the ""Large"" size and they are all enjoyable to wear on my 6.2""/210lb/35"" waist. Do a search to find some of the other colors available on Amazon as well. This ""brand"" of Paratrooper Fatigues are the best i have found, for the money.

Chocolate/Dark Brown: This color is the darkest pair i own and i really like them, but they are not at the top of the list, due to my personal taste when it comes to pairing dark brown with shirts/shoes.

Olive Drab: This color and Woodland were the first colors i purchased  and while i did love the fit, Olive eventually became the least favorite color i owned. I wore them around the house (gardening, etc), but when i went out, the other colors were much more pleasing to wear/match.

Woodland: If you are tired of only finding cheap, ugly patterned, skinny jean camo pants in stores, get yourself a pair of these. The pattern is awesome and they fit loose/flexible on my 35"" waste. They look/feel like real military issue woodland camo pants, at a good price.

Stone/universal: This is a whitish color and my favorite pair on a warm day where i need to dress nice, but still be casual/relaxed. They breathe much better than jeans and the color won't absorb the heat.

Khaki: This color is what you would expect, but the fit is somewhat looser/baggier/softer that the other colors i have. This makes it a great choice for those that need a flexible and loose pair of pants. Or, for those that find the large size in the other colors just a tad too tight. Pairs well with most anything.

Russett Brown: I just received  a pair of these and have only worn them once, but to me, this color has more character than the Chocolate/Dark Brown. It blends very well with the color shoes and shirts i prefer.

Overall: If you love cargo type pants and have been searching for a loose fitting pair, which in my experience is hard to find for my frame (6.2""/210lb/35"" waist), do yourself a favor and get one of these. The price is great for how much you will want to wear them... It won't be long until your own several colors, like me!",B00022JPNE
"I own several Rothco Paratrooper Fatigues in the ""Large"" size and they are all enjoyable to wear on my 6.2""/210lb/35"" waist.

Olive Drab: This color and Woodland were the first colors i purchased  and while i did love the fit, Olive eventually became the least favorite color i owned. I wore them around the house (gardening, etc), but when i went out, the other colors were much more pleasing to wear/match.

Woodland: If you are tired of only finding cheap, ugly patterned, skinny jean camo pants in stores, get yourself a pair of these. The pattern is awesome and they fit loose/flexible on my 35"" waste. They look/feel like real military issue woodland camo pants, at a good price.

Stone/universal: This is a whitish color and my favorite pair on a warm day where i need to dress nice, but still be casual/relaxed. They breathe much better than jeans and the color won't absorb the heat.

Khaki: This color is what you would expect, but the fit is somewhat looser/baggier/softer that the other colors i have. This makes it a great choice for those that need a flexible and loose pair of pants. Or, for those that find the large size in the other colors, just a tad too tight. Pairs well with most anything.

Chocolate: These are actually in another Rothco listing: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K28PQ4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00 ... This color is the darkest pair i own and i really like them, but they are not at the top of the list, due to my personal taste when it comes to pairing dark brown with shirts/shoes.

Russett Brown (also in the other listing) : I just received  a pair of these and have only worn them once, but to me, this color has more character than the Chocolate. It blends very well with the color shoes and shirts i prefer.

Overall: If you love cargo type pants and have been searching for a great fitting pair, which imo is hard to find for my frame (6.2""/210lb/35"" waist), do yourself a favor and get one of these. The price is great for how much you will want to wear them... It won't be long until your own several colors, like me!",B00022JPNE
Nice quality pants. My son really liked them.,B00022JPNE
Fit perfect my boy uses these to go shooting and paint balling.,B00022JPNE
Perfect fit and great to go shooting for the day. I also use them for Paintballing.,B00022JPNE
Took the pants out of the wrapper and put them on. Went to button the waist and the button fell off. I've had a pocket button fall off as well. More annoyed than anything. The material seems to be sturdy and of good quality. Shoddy inspection of finished product.,B00022JPNE
These are great quality and fit about as expected. They have sizing tabs on the sides to help ensure an exact fit.,B00022JPNE
Poor sewing on the buttons. One actually fell off day one. Easily fixed but I shouldn't have to sew buttons on my new pants..would rather they skipped out on the fake military tags and put that money towards quality sewing of the buttons...none the less the rest of the sewing and material quality was great and I have no other complaints on these pants.,B00022JPNE
The best pair of pants. I bought green woodland camo before but for some reason this design is the best for Midwestern or Northwest/Northeast regions. I love the color pattern and my waist is 36-38 the Large size is perfect.,B00022JPNE
Good pair of pants. Will buy again.,B00022JPNE
"These ara great, i own several pairs.  I use them as a work pant and they hold up better than jrans",B00022JPNE
"The only pants my son wears. He is on about his 20th pair. Durable, easy to wash, adjustable waist.",B00022JPNE
"They run large, quality is 5 stars.  Great pants.  Sizing just runs way large.",B00022JPNE
"My husband is retired military and he loves these fatigues, they are perfect !",B00022JPNE
a little too big but maybe they will draw up afyer washed and dried .,B00022JPNE
"Legs are a little long but out of all the clothes i purchased on Amazon, these pants actually fit a large guy like my self
in a world were clothing designers are producing clothes only for teenagers only !",B00022JPNE
"Nice pants ....I love them......Im buying a nother one......I got big 2x because I was not sure if they run small
and I wanted baggy to ride my hayabusa motorcycle.............thank you very much",B00022JPNE
"I ordered one of these but with the camo colors in medium size, the waist too big for me, I now order this one in Small, waist too small, I supposed I'm not Small not Medium, the fabric feels different a little bit hard, uncounting the size issue, is not a bad product if you find your size, I believe they change depending of the colors you order.",B00022JPNE
These pants fit great and look awesome. You can tie up the bottoms and snug them into boots. The pockets are great and the pants seem well enough made to last quite some time.,B00022JPNE
"Really like these.  I like that they have a zipper instead of button up.  I'm 36-38 waste and bought Xl.  I'm 6'4"" but not long legged.  Fit perfect.  I will be buying more",B00022JPNE
"I'm a women's size 8-10 and I ordered a size Medium, which is labeled as for a waist size of 31-35"". I had accidentally ordered the wrong color but the fit was a little big (plenty of room to spare), but better than too tight!  I'd say the waist was around 31-32"". However, since I ordered the wrong color I made an exchange and the second pair I received are WAY bigger. Much closer to 35"" this time, maybe even 36"", now I am totally swimming in them. I don't mind though since I'm just using these for a costume. I should be able to shrink them some in the wash and will use the waist clips and wear a belt lol. But just beware that the sizing is inconsistent!  Might have been able to fit in a small (27-31"") but who knows. I didn't pay much attention to the inseam since there are ties to accommodate that. I am short (5 foot 4) but I thought the length was manageable on both pairs - didn't feel too balloon-like or anything. Hope this helps!",B00022JPNE
"The only problem is, i had to return it because i didn't like the zipper... itt doesnt look like it will last... its quite thin material compared to other zippers... if this was button fly, i would have kept it.",B00022JPNE
"Very comfortable. Lighter material than I expected. Summer pants for sure. Had two more pockets than I was expecting, a good thing.",B00022JPNE
I ordered these for my husband. Read reviews and ordered a size up pants were a little too big. Order your right size. Other than that looks just like the pic and came on time.,B00022JPNE
"these pants are great bought an XXL and I liked them so much bought a pair in black.  Great for work, hanging out, basically any non formal event.  Would surely recommend these to a friend.  Material is soft and they look great with boots or sneakers",B00022JPNE
"Great pants, very soft. Only issue I've run into is that the zipper can be a bit easy to get stuck. You can easily fix it by wiggling it over any problem areas, but still a bit annoying. Also, you'll probably want to re-sew the main button as soon as you get them as mine came loose after wearing the pants twice.",B00022JPNE
"These are made from light material and I don't expect them to be that durable, but in a sweltering summer they're pretty nifty for a tech guy with a lot of gadgets.",B00022JPNE
my bush pants and I love all the extra pockets,B00022JPNE
"i bought shorts from this company and the look great!
Pants?...NOT SO GREAT! They was already faded like someone washed them in the washer before sending them to me!",B00022JPNE
"I have purchased 3 pair of these prior, but for some reason the size is smaller than the previous 3 pair I got. The first 3 pair I got had a ""ROTHCO"" dog tag, and this pair had a ""ULTRA FORCE"" dog tag.  Must be different company that makes them, I don't know.",B00022JPNE
"I lost weight and looked everywhere for a smaller version of these pants, and found them here, they're great! Very happy!",B00022JPNE
"As soft as sweatpants but as strong and durable as denim. I own four pairs of Rothcos wear them nearly every day. Added bonus, the cargo pockets are large enough for a 12"" laptop. Serious storage.",B00022JPNE
Color is darker and browner than Olive Green.,B00022JPNE
nice and baggy with adjustable waistline. Would buy again.,B00022JPNE
Very comfortable and roomy with lots of compartments to put stuff. Would definately buy again.,B00022JPNE
"I purchased these because I have always hated having a button up crotch. These pants address that issue but they are 100% cotton and are not rip stop or anything I would really want to wear in hot or cold weather. My original pair must have been Tru Spec, 511, or Propper because these are nothing like what I was used to. These just do not breath well and I think I am about done with Rothco products.",B00022JPNE
"terrible quality, really regret the purchase",B00022JPNE
"Very nice pants, I intend to wear them semi formal with the camouflage long sleeve shirts that I have, rolling up the cuffs. Thanks!!!",B00022JPNE
Quality. Holds up very well after extreme abuse.,B00022JPNE
The most comfortable pants I have ever own,B00022JPNE
"The pants fit perfectly in the waist, but are nearly 6 inches too long in the legs.  I do have a somewhat odd frame, so your mileage may vary.",B00022JPNE
I have several pairs of these and enjoy them very much.,B00022JPNE
"Pants are nice - what I am looking for in terms of pockets and quality; however, I agree with some of the other reviews in terms of size.  I am a 32 waist so I ordered the medium and it was too small.  I then ordered the large and it was way too big.  I think based on other reviews that their sizes are not consistent.",B00022JPNE
I bought a pair of these about 5 years ago and they are still going strong. Love em!,B00022JPNE
These pants are great. Very comfortable and feel very durable. They arrived a few days ahead of schedule in perfect condition.,B00022JPNE
"good product, looks good and works perfect",B00022JPNE
"I've had them for a long time.  I use them when I work outside, since my wife hates them.  I have another pair in my car that are there for emergencies.  I will buy these again!",B00022JPNE
"The pants in nice and good quality fabric ; however, the size I chose was not right and I was big enough that I could not enjoy it ...
Published suggest clearer sizes and thus avoid disappointments customers",B00022JPNE
I liked these so much i ordered 4 more pairs,B00022JPNE
Came in way too large. I expected a mediumnand recieved a xxl.,B00022JPNE
wears all the time... very comfy.,B00022JPNE
Fit as expected. Brother in law was happy with them.,B00022JPNE
"Light comfortable pants with 2 front pockets, 2 rear pockets, and 4 lerg cargo pockets.",B00022JPNE
The size ended up being 39-41!! Way too big,B00022JPNE
Better quality than I expected.  They do run a little large.,B00022JPNE
Old school all the way! Those ankle tie's are particularly useful with my snake boots.,B00022JPNE
The waist is too big but the tab adjustments work. Very well made.,B00022JPNE
They looked great but was too large.,B00022JPNE
"They look good, but they aren't really paratroopers pants because they have a zipper and military pants don't.",B00022JPNE
I ALWAYS WANTED A PAIR OF WINTER CAMO'S AND NOW I HAVE THEM.....THEY FIT GREAT,B00022JPNE
Nice trousers. Made in China :/,B00022JPNE
"I love these even if they are wee big. I bought a medium thinking they'd be perfect but I think I could have gotten away with a small. Overall though.. they are super comfy! soft, the pockets are perfect... These are fun!",B00022JPNE
The parents were good quality but the size chart was in accurate,B00022JPNE
very disappointed ... these pants are huge!,B00022JPNE
"material is nice BUT! im 6 and a change, 180lbs... i read a few reviews and i found out that guys shorter, and lighter than me find L perfect...... i will put it this way... Perfect? yeah sure MAYBE IN PRISON. If you are not saggy pants lover and you are about mine size, take ""M"". I sent back L and few days later i got M size. It fits good, very comfortable, good quality material. I like it.",B00022JPNE
"AS OPPOSED TO TRADITIONAL JEANS YOU HAVE MORE OPTIONS FOR CARRYING VALUABLES,WE ALL HAVE CELL PHONES, WALLET,KEYS ETC.",B00022JPNE
"This is my second pair of these pants.  I like that the cotton is very comfortable at the first wearing, and the fit is very loose.  I have a big hips and thighs, so I love to find pants that don't squeeze when I have to sit for long periods.  Those with no butt might find them too loose; it depends on what you like.  The pants have adjustments at the sides of the waist, so I can pull the waist in.  The pants are a bit too long for me at 5'9"", but with the ankle ties, they don't slip over my shoes. The pockets are a good size and have button closures.  I also like having the extra cargo pockets.",B00022JPNE
"Sorry to say, I ordered the wrong size!  I returned them and ordered a small; and they are perfect!",B00022JPNE
"I love these pants! I normally wear a 32/32, these are big but have waist cinch straps. I started with one pair and now have every color. I did have them all tailored. Now they're perfect.",B00022JPNE
"Got these for my husband and he loved them! We had been looking for a while. They are the perfect color and they look good on him. I ordered the extra large and once you adjust them on the side at the waist, you are good to go! Thank you for making these available! I am going to order me a pair!",B00022JPNE
These are my favorite pair of pants. Have three pairs now in different colors.,B00022JPNE
"Very large , please contact me at [jamesanewbould@yahoo.com]  I need to exchange them . Thank you Jim Newbould .",B00022JPNE
I like these pants they feel very comfortable good for work or just lounging around.,B00022JPNE
I bought these for my son.he loves them and wants another pair for his birthday.,B00022JPNE
"The quality is excellent! I am a thick-curvy women with a small waist and large hips and very thick legs, most pant legs fit tight if they fit me at the waist or hips so I ordered a size up. I can still wear them because i like loose fitting pants but had i ordered try to my size they would be a perfect fit. I love them just the same. Great buy.",B00022JPNE
"These run rather long.  If you like clothes that are half worn out these are for you,  like stone washed.",B00022JPNE
Product as described. Great quality. Would use this vendor again.,B00022JPNE
"Used fit chart, purchased as gift. Return window expired before gift given, now stuck with $37.99 rag.",B00022JPNE
Great product size is just perfect right on spot !,B00022JPNE
"OK product. Very tight in the waist, but the next size up is huge.",B00022JPNE
I ordered 46/32 and got 46/320000 Damn these legs are long as hell. need to be sewed up but I love them!,B00022JPNE
"Thoroughly enjoying these pants and the capabilities they offer! Rugged, camo, manly pants...",B00022JPNE
Not to big or to small.. I'm 6-0 220 lbs they fit me just right!,B00022JPNE
Got lucky cause they fit perfectly. Very good product for the money.,B00022JPNE
"Dig um much, my favs, highly recommend them,  military specs from the 40's,  nice fabric cool vintage look.",B00022JPNE
"I ordered these thinking they would shrink in the wash, but they did not. No big deal, really; just a little bigger than what I typically prefer. Aside from that, these are really comfy. The material, despite having a worn, broken in feel, seems like it would be durable. Great for outdoor activities or just hanging out. Will buy again, just a size smaller.",B00022JPNE
Cool Pants. Thick material and buttons not lame Velcro.,B00022JPNE
Quilty was very good but if your waist is 31 and above get the M size,B00022JPNE
not large so much as long.  on my 5'4 son they are really long. well made and good color.,B00022JPNE
"They weren't what i expected. First they were too big, about two sizes bigger then a medium which i ordered. Second i needed bdu pants to match my bdu top for hunting but the colors on the pants are darker then authentic woodland camo.and i have OCD so the color difference messes with me. It would be better if there was a top of the same color but theres not i looked...",B00022JPNE
Fit good but just a little long. Comfortable and well made.,B00022JPNE
"I think the real military uses desert digital camo. I saw a pair on Amazon and was hesitant to order that style because the pants looked so realistic. I opted for this style. They are well stitched,rugged,and durable.",B00022JPNE
Nice cargo pants they fit like expected very satisfied with product.,B00022JPNE
Very comfortable! Fits as expected and advertised.,B00022JPNE
"Excellent pants. I use these pants for parkour which they seem to be particularly suited for, as they do not limit movement range (unlike many other brands of cargo pants, and certainly any jeans I've ever worn). So far, after literally wearing solely these these pants for a year now in my very active, outdoor life, rotating through 4 pairs, they have shown themselves to be very durable. The pockets are secure, and the seams strong. The component which wore out most quickly was actually the fabric on the back of the pant leg, and that only from sliding on concrete (The failure of the material was not catastrophic, and was easily patched).

Aside from the durability and freedom of movement these pants bring fourth, they are also exceedingly comfortable. For me, it's like a socially acceptable way to mingle with society in pajama pants.

One thing to keep in mind is that these pants run very large. I would recommend buying a size below your norm.

Again, excellent product, could not recommend highly enough!",B00022JPNE
"I love this cargos, I wear them a lot , I wish they were cheaper to buy more",B00022JPNE
Returned because they were too large.,B00022JPNE
I'm 5ft 11 190 pounds i've been having trouble getting the right size so this time i ordered a L waist fits me good my only complaint is the croth area seems to be a tad bit too long but I washed them and it fits better- length is perfect because its a draw String at the end- Slightly baggier than i would want but i think going down to a medium would be too tight around the waist.,B00022JPNE
"Not the greatest quality pant, some fraying apparent on the waist adjustment straps and pocket and button stitching after a few weeks (office) wear. I really couldn't imagine taking these to the range or onto the trail without worrying about rips and tears.",B00022JPNE
Second pair ordered after having to return the first due to side pocket being swen into cargo pocket. Now returning this pair for same reason and missing belt loop; even had an arrow sticker pointing to the defect. On the positive side fit for both pairs was ok.,B00022JPNE
"Pretty awesome, the multiple pockets are extremely useful.",B00022JPNE
"I gave this 5 stars because I had no problem returning them for the correct size I needed. I did read the fit was a little big, but I have wide hips and thought going to a 3x would give me better movement, but they were really way to big. I could have fit another person in with me.",B00022JPNE
"Christmas present for my husband! He loved them!
He could no longer wear his vintage military issue camos to work. (Dress code.)
So I found these, he can wear what he's comfortable in at work in a professional environment.",B00022JPNE
don't wear them in the winter or you will freeze your behind I think they run a little small,B00022JPNE
If you typically wear a size 36 in jeans get an XL. The waist runs really small.,B00022JPNE
"I own about a dozen of these in a couple different colors and I love em. Not a complaint in the world. Never had one rip, fade, or wear out in any way. Built the way things should be built.",B00022JPNE
The density of the fabric was not what I expected. Disappointed in the quality of the fabric.,B00022JPNE
"I first bought mediums and they were WAY too big, so much so I bought XSmall the next time and just the waist was too small so I finally opted for the small and they are just the right fit.",B00022JPNE
They fit well. I love the amount of pockets.,B00022JPNE
Love these.  Fit as expected and the extra pockets are great.,B00022JPNE
"Bought these fatigues for my grandson and he loves them.  The large size fit him perfectly.  He his 6'2"" and weighs about 210.",B00022JPNE
The waist tabs eliminate my need for a belt which is awesome since a belt digs into my stomach when I sit for long periods.,B00022JPNE
Great and durable military style pants.  I had my first pair for over four years and just ordered two additional pairs which hopefully will last me another four years.  Pants are very comfortable and there is plenty of pocket room.  These bet any store bought pants in my opinion,B00022JPNE
Fits perfectly and made of good material it also looks great when my husband got it he wore it almost all the time,B00022JPNE
"pants are good quality, I always loved the sturdiness of fatigues, a little large in the waste for me, (I'm a skinny guy) although I should probably wear a belt with them the side straps are sufficient for light work.",B00022JPNE
not like issue fatigue pants but I still love all of the extra pockets and room for legs to move with out  binding up while moving around.,B00022JPNE
These pants are great. Love the fit and comfort. Same quality and fit as the woodland camo version. I've used them for hunting and camping. They've held up to the elements.,B00022JPNE
I absolutely love these. Built well and fit awesome on body building type body. Plenty of length for long legs also.,B00022JPNE
Softer material. Long enough for my 34 inseam.,B00022JPNE
"I bought these pants for my Son that likes to wear them to work.  The quality is great and the fit is perfect.  I had bought him some different ones that were cheaper that I thought would work just as good - - - NOT!  It would be great if these were a little less expensive, but not if it reduced the quality of the pants.  This is where I and my Son will be buying all of his camo pants in the future.",B00022JPNE
"very comfortable. lightweight pants. arrived quickly. These are good for relaxing, lounging  or doing work around the house. They will not make an impression if you are getting ""dressed up"". Might be a little lightweight for winter but great for warmer days. I own two pairs. I wear a 36 waist and ordered a Large size. Fits well with a little extra room..",B00022JPNE
Way to big. And I am 6' 180lb.  Otherwise nice quality. I exchanged them for a L. Haven't gotten them yet.,B00022JPNE
I'm real happy with these pants.  They fit well,B00022JPNE
I have 3 other pairs of fatigues and these are more comfortable than jeans,B00022JPNE
Great fit! and very nice shirts!!!,B00022JPNE
"According to him they are super comfortable, fit great and are really heavy duty...and in my opinion they look great!",B00022JPNE
"nice runs a bit long and I'm 6'3""",B00022JPNE
"Bought both the Woodland Cammo and the Kakies, both fit perfectly (know what military size you should ware). The material is lighter in color and weight to Propper attire. The pants are both durable, but the Kakies have only one button for each side pocket and back pocket closue. The difference makes back pocket access easier, but the side pockets a little less secure. All in all, would purchase again.",B00022JPNE
"great for exercise, lounging, or what ever. Verycomfortable",B00022JPNE
"Ok if price, not quality is not your priority.",B00022JPNE
"I liked that they were soft material cargo pants with adjustable waist using friction bands.
However, anything placed in the thigh pockets would easily fall or jump out upon any sort of walking or movement.
It cost me an expensive multi-tool and I was fortunate enough to always hear my cellphone hit the floor whenever it would fall out.
These pants need some elastic bands inside of the pocket lips for gear retention!",B00022JPNE
"I ordered a 36, and pants were too large!! i should have got the size 32 or 34. Not sure what would be better. Although im a 34-36 size, these pants were way to large for my waste. So i hade to resize.

Quality was ok.",B00022JPNE
I am buying the trousers for some time already... always happy with the quality.. it is comfortable to wear.... extra pockets are the bonus on the trousers.... would recommend to friends,B00022JPNE
"First off, the size is weird. These pants are DEFINITELY made to sit at the true waist, and not on the hips, which was very confusing and somewhat uncomfortable to me at first. I ordered an extra-small, which puts the waist at about 28in. The inseam is 32in with a 12in rise, meaning the total length of the pant is much longer than I had anticipated. So in the end, these ended up being smaller around the waist and longer on the legs than I wanted.

That being said, once I got used to wearing them up around my waist, the legs are just the right length and the waist has stretched appropriately. These pants are awesome. Very,very durable and comfortable. The fabric seemed thin at first, but they're warmer than I would have thought and lighter for it. These have very quickly become my new favorite pants, despite the initial issues with the size.",B00022JPNE
I purchased these to wear for my part time job. They fit perfectly and I enough room to move around in and don't feel restricted. I will definitely be buying more in different color asap.,B00022JPNE
"I now own 5 pairs in different colors and i think they are a great buy for the price. The comfort level is amazing and they are very durable. The only difference I notice between these and US issued is they don't have a knee pocket, instead they have a double knee stitched on. All around they are great!",B00022JPNE
A little bigger than anticipated,B00022JPNE
Only thing is the button popped off 3rd time wearing them it could be a little stronger stitched on there,B00022JPNE
guess it's a pants works for me,B00022JPNE
"Bought these for my son who wore them with his football jersey on Fridays. They fit him perfectly in the waist and are holding up well. He is 5'10"" and about 185, medium fits him well. I usually buy him 32x32 pants. They might be a tad long, but totally wearable.",B00022JPNE
"Was expecting these to be made a lot more durable than they feel like. They are about as lightweight as my flannel pants that I sleep in (maybe a bit exaggerated, but not that far off sadly). No rigidity around the waist at all, felt like I was pulling a belt over boxers. The $20 Basic Wrangler Cargo Pants they sell at Walmart are a more solid pair of pants than these.

I normally wear Propper, but I was told to give Rothco a try. I don't think I will be doing that again. I understand that these are not Military Spec Pants, but I can buy a pair of Military Spec Pants from Propper for the same price, so I was expecting a bit more out of these.

Returned; might try another Rothco product at some point, but not a fan right now.",B00022JPNE
"I bought these to dye pink and I now have a fantastic pair of pink cargo pants. (I used 1 bottle of liquid Rit, in case you are curious.)
Now I am excited to see how well they age :)",B00022JPNE
"These fit my husband like a glove, he has an athletic build and they fit perfect around his thick legs and butt. Now I want to get him one in every color! You won't be disappointed with these pants.",B00022JPNE
Love them for work or casual stepping out,B00022JPNE
They were great! My husband has a 3lb dog he loves to put in a pocket and take anywhere. Pants with large enough pockets are hard to find. We will be buying more!,B00022JPNE
"Very cool and stylish
Good purchase",B00022JPNE
The fit and quality were just right.,B00022JPNE
"Best fitting camo  pant, true to size & will be buying  more!",B00022JPNE
These things are comfy soft! They fit very well. (Baggy fit) The only gripe I have is that the belt loops won't accommodate an extra large  belt (width) and the belt loops are chintzy.,B00022JPNE
Nice quality pants...  they size kinda big.  I'm a 36in waist and ordered the XL.  Have to wear a belt or they will fall down.,B00022JPNE
Great pants. I love cargo pants from all over the world. They are all pretty much the same. Cargo pants for casual dress cannot be beat. Nice pants.,B00022JPNE
I can carry lots of personal stuff in the pockets.  One of my co-workers said she liked my pants and asked where she can get one.,B00022JPNE
"I am 5'10"", 172 lbs and had some problems with the sizes. I was looking for a military-style fit. M was of good length and fit at the waist when fully tightened. Normal nice fit at the legs too, but there was way too much space all around the pelvis, for my taste anyway. The S is much smaller. The legs are again ok, pelvis area a bit snug which I don't mind but this time the waist is way too small even when fully extended at the sides. I kept the S for the day when I loose those 4-5 lbs, because the price is really nice. The ankle and waist tighteners function well and the color is to my liking as well.",B00022JPNE
Super comfy!!! Getting two more pairs for work,B00022JPNE
"I was skeptical about ordering pants online at first, but my risk, consideration and patience has done more than paid off.
They're the best pants I own, I could never find a pair of pants as ideal as these.
I'm ordering another Black pair, and one in Woodland Camo too.

They're comfortable, roomy, maneuverable and they look great.
Despite my pair being black, I can wear these in the Florida Summer heat with no discomfort at all.",B00022JPNE
"These are just great....I will buy them again and again...I can fit all my essential gear (knives, fire starters, compasses, folded maps) for roughing it into the pockets...eight in all, front and back...and they fit very well...I spilled spaghetti sauce all over my first pair once, just boiled a little water and it came right out...comfortable and very durable...stitching on the buttons is impressively strong, since that's usually the first thing I destroy on any piece of clothing...a solid buy",B00022JPNE
My daughter loves these. We bought them as part of a costume for a school project and now she lives in them.,B00022JPNE
These are awesome pants. Well beyond my expectations. Was worried about sizing but they fit perfect. I wear a 36-38 waist and 32-34 inseam and the large was spot on. Will be ordering more for sure. Thank You Rothco,B00022JPNE
They fit perfect and feel great.  zero complaints,B00022JPNE
"Son in law is a SWAT member and has pants like these, very roomy in thigh area, I been begging him for pants like this from police stock. I got these Rothco pants and they are high quality. I plan on ordering more.",B00022JPNE
"The product is a little bit baggy, not like the skinny jean fad going around in today's America... The main problem with these is the material being THIN... It does not FEEL like it will stand the test of time, due to the THINNESS of the material... I understand companies want to save money but this just isn't the way to do it. The stitching is shoddy as well...",B00022JPNE
"Quality Material and build.
Pockets are large enough for many items
Fabric is comfortable
I could wear these pants everyday
I bought a Large and I have a 34"" waist and 6'2"" I do wear a belt w them.",B00022JPNE
They only thing I didn't like about these was that they were too long.,B00022JPNE
They fit great! Look and feel good. Seen well made. I will send addendum if they don't hold up like they should.,B00022JPNE
"I read all the reviews and then decided to purchase. If you are a tall man you might want to go a size up. They fit great and most reviews are accurate. My husband is 6""5 and the size I ordered fits but I wish I had ordered the next size up to get a little extra length.",B00022JPNE
"Construction is  very very nice and robust , however I bought the wrong  size ....dang it .",B00022JPNE
"I bought these about a year and a half ago for my fiance because he likes wearing his dad's old BDU pants. He likes that these have a zipper, leg ties, and double patched knees. They are too big for him, but I aimed to get him a little bit of a baggier size because that's how he likes them.",B00022JPNE
"They fit and feel like they took a pair of dickies and sewn the additional pockets on them. I don't mind the look and feel. They feel more like work pants versus something of casual, workout, or duty wear.",B00022JPNE
Over all these are nice for casual and formal wear...Long sleeve button up and tie or a t-shirt...Universal makes for practical use,B00022JPNE
"Just recieved my order. Pants are great. Im 6' , 185#. Medium fits perfect. Very comfortable. Love the style. Thanks rothco, and amazon. I will be ordering more soon.",B00022JPNE
"Good Fabric great design, buy these, great for tactical and casual ware",B00022JPNE
Nice. Fit just right. I am a 36 in waist. Good leg room too.lenght is good. I am washing them since new hopdfully they will not draw up much.,B00022JPNE
I wear a 31 so I had to synch it down and wear a belt. Other than that it fits well. Good work pants.,B00022JPNE
The size if correct.  Fits well.,B00022JPNE
"Medium? I've ordered these cargos as replacements from my previous two vintage cargos.  There is a noticeable increase in length over the years.  The original cargos I own fit very well.  The second was an inch longer than the first (manageable).  These cargos are an inch longer than the second cargos.  Overall, two inches longer?  Unserviceable.  Rothco has not kept up with the original design.  Quality control is lacking, also the increase in polyester and less cotton is a big disappointment.",B00022JPNE
"Fit exactly as I hoped. Very comfortable, tough fabric, high quality stitching. I'm going to buy more.",B00022JPNE
The pants were the wrong color. Never tried them on.,B00022JPNE
"Well made, sized correctly for me. a bit heavier than ones that I have made in China.  Prefer this brand.",B00022JPNE
Poor quality with a cheesy zippered fly,B00022JPNE
"These pants are super comfortable and after a year of hard wear, I consider to be very durable.  I wear them for working on cars, doing yard work or any other manual labor, or just as casual wear for going to the store and back.  Sizing may be a tad large, but that's fine in my book as the extra room makes it easy to move around, squat, etc.",B00022JPNE
"We have purchased around 20 pair of these for our employees and the zippers keep breaking. Also, the side sizers don't stay if you need the pants smaller. Too bad because we really liked them otherwise. Also, the company won't work with us on better pricing per large orders so we will go elsewhere.",B00022JPNE
waist size was accurate.  i just wish i could have chosen a shorter length. other than that the pants fit very well and feel durable.,B00022JPNE
VERY DECEIVING! MUCH TOO BIG! PLEASE SEND ME AN XL !!,B00022JPNE
"Bought these in a Large along with the Ultra Force BDUs and the latter was waaay too big. I'm 5'8"" 185LBS and these Rothco ones fit perfectly with some room to spare in the waist to clip on a holster.",B00022JPNE
At last a decent pair of pants that meets my expectations and exceeds them. Well made and fit as expected. I can't promote these enough and if you looking for products like these .. go no further .. these are great!,B00022JPNE
"Very nice and comfortable, a little big.",B00022JPNE
These are a great buy and have done well through a few long hikes and 2 Uhaul worth of moves.  Very comfy and appear to be holding up well.  Will definitely be ordering more as needed.  Not to mention a great price for new (not used) bdu's.,B00022JPNE
"Lot of pockets, seem well made.",B00022JPNE
A bit large but works with a belt and great for yard work. I'll get med next time.,B00022JPNE
"Crotch too small. :D

Just feels weird but I can wear them IF i have too though",B00022JPNE
A great pair of pants. look good feel better,B00022JPNE
"I wear a size 34 waist and based on the manufacturer's recommendations I ordered a size medium. They fit a little on the tight side around the waist, but I don't expect to be gaining any weight (hopefully). The manufacture of the pants looks to be very nice and I have not doubt they will serve their purpose very well. Although I have no complains with these pants, the next size I purchase will be a large - I prefer them to be a little loose as appose to a little tight.",B00022JPNE
"These fit very well. I am 6'1"" tall 208 lbs 36 inch waist. I have another pair of ROTHCO BDU that has a button fly. These have a zipper, which is much nicer. I wear work boots, so these have the Perfect length for my hieght.  These fit me really nice and I like the color.",B00022JPNE
These pants are a good 8 inches too long. Aside from that they're a great pair of cargo pants.,B00022JPNE
The item came quickly and my husband loved them.,B00022JPNE
"High quality, perfect fit, awesome feel. Doesn't feel hard and thin like the proppers. I have owned Propper brand and rothco brand BDUs. These are thicker, softer, and have brighter and higher contrast patterns.",B00022JPNE
"Soft, comfortable fit, especially after a washing or two.  I mainly wear for work pants.  The adjustments in the waist allow for a custom fit where it counts while the legs remain roomy.  Would buy again.",B00022JPNE
"I'm a big guy, so clothes tend to be sized too low and I order one size larger.  That is NOT the case with this manufacturer, so order one size smaller.  Other than its huge sizing, they are well made and a good price.",B00022JPNE
"Decent quality but honestly, only worth $15-20. Nothing special here, just run-of-the-mill cargo pants.",B00022JPNE
"these are great. legs on this were a little extra long but no worries. tie em up with attached leg straps.
theyre ARE VERY well made. thick but light. I want more.
don't hesitate the price is right. got here fast, thanks for this product at a great price to value ratio!",B00022JPNE
"These are only for the men who love cargo pants with good construction ( last pair still in great shape after about 2 years) AND pockets for all the stuff they like to have with them (usually electronics).  They have adjustments in the waist for men who are not the normal sizes.  Example being, a small waist but tall.  I am glad i found the rebuy button on Amazon, I would have bought them sooner but i couldn't remember what exactly i had bought the first time.",B00022JPNE
"good well made but hard to size have large but short friends, one  who is going to get a present",B00022JPNE
Own several other pairs. They are very sturdy and comfortable. Fit just as expected would highly recommend. Others have lasted years.,B00022JPNE
"These pants are very soft, due to being stone washed before they sell them.  They fit very well and the color is a nice brown color.

The material seems to be real sturdy and would be great for hiking around or wearing around town.  The stitching seems to be very good and doesn't look like it will fall apart.

It has ties down at the bottom of the pants legs like old school BDUs...I cut them off.",B00022JPNE
"I reserve 1and 5 stars for very poor, or exceptional items.  These had good fit (I'm 5'7"" with a 34""W and thick legs) which can be a pain for me.  I've washed them a few times, and they seem like they are holding up.",B00022JPNE
"RETURNED FOR EXCHANGE. THE LARGE FITS GOOD, BUY THESE PANTS BASED ON YOUR ACTUAL WAIST AND INSEAM MEASURES WILL BUY AGAIN.",B00022JPNE
These pants are very comfortable and fit me perfect.  For the money you can't go wrong.  It has lots of pockets and look well made.,B00022JPNE
"These are a great pair of men's Cargo pants at a fair price! I enjoy wearing them while I'm doing yard work, going to the gun range, running errands and any house hold chore! Great quality and comfort!",B00022JPNE
"This pant is good. There are 2 little belts to adjust the pant for a better fitting. At the bottom 2 stripes to tie up each leg, so it's great to use with long boots without the pant's legs getting up.",B00022JPNE
"just wanted to add another data point for sizing help - i'm 5'10"", 200lbs. i wear size 36 dockers and either 34 or 36 levi's depending on the cut. i'm USUALLY a large for bottoms - gym shorts, etc. so i ordered these in large and they were wearable, but noticeably too big and baggy. decided to try my luck with the mediums and they're PERFECT. waist is snug but not too tight, and the cut is great for freedom of movement (stepping up onto things, squatting down, whatever). the legs would barely drag on the ground if i wore them with sneakers, but with boots and the bottoms tied then they're great.

the other thing i really like about these is how they deal with moisture. light spills or splashes will bead up and run off, and they're VERY quick drying if they do get wet. rather lightweight so great for warm weather, but i'd want something a little thicker for when it gets chilly.",B00022JPNE
Great quality for a great price. My son was looking for something to wear while playing airsoft. These pants exceeded my expectation.,B00022JPNE
"I'd recommend these pants to anyone looking for durability, and comfort at a reasonable price. I love the fact that on those long flights, I'm able to remove all the items in my hip pockets, move them to the lower pockets, and rest comfortably knowing my wallet and passport are safe. I never hesitate to put these on regardless of the days plans.",B00022JPNE
"Exactly the tactical pants I needed! These pants have wider leg width for comfort fit in any position (Standing, Prone, etc). I dropped a burning coal from my cigar onto them yesterday, and it didn't even leave a mark. They are tough, baggy, and ready for fitable thanks to the strap adjustments on the side.",B00022JPNE
"The material and style were just fine, fit is larger than expected.  The biggest problem is the zipper blew apart after one wash and I will have to have it repaired (I am no seamstress) since I waited too long to exchange.  Will probably buy these thru Captain Daves in the future.",B00022JPNE
"I like the build and materials, I would recommend these pants just order larger then you think you need then.",B00022JPNE
"Pants are lightweight.  I wear 36W 34L in Levi's, these pants fit loose and comfortable. Nice and long. The zipper is not heavy duty. Would be great if the price was a little less.",B00022JPNE
"They are prewashed but good pants. Sizes are comparable to military bdu. Good pants, worth it. Would buy them again",B00022JPNE
"Now this is a QUALITY product. I was looking to replace my worn out house pants with a comfortable and utilitous pant. I naturally looked to cargo pants. I took the time to visit various Army and Navy stores but the quality of the pant was lacking, as well as the fit. This pant does it all, quality and fit. Having said that I had to return several pairs only to purchase the same size again in hopes of getting an advertised fit. I order a small size but the actually size varies and measuring the pant found that the size can exceed the maximum size by an inch and a half. So I closed my eyes and returned the pant and re-ordered the pant and found serendipitously that the size was as advertised and did fit. Hence a bit more quality control on the size is in order. I am a retired engineer and now consult for the company I spent my career with and do computational work in front of a computer for most of the day and these pants  well I love them -.  The material, the construction, stitching/seams, the seat and knee re-enforcements all speak, well made. I have now have two pair and plan to purchase three other pairs. They come in a variety of colors and camouflage patterns to select from.  I did not think I would purchase clothing on Amazon, just to personal to purchase site unseen, but circumstances conspired such that I did do just exactly that, and I am surprised that I am satisfied. I am a picky type of guy and really like to touch, feel, and try on my clothing, but, purchasing outside of my comfort zone worked for me. Perhaps they will do the same for you.",B00022JPNE
These pants are comfortable and seem to be able to take a beating so far. I have them in multiple colors. The 2x is longer than I would like but thats my fault for not loosing weight lol... Plus there are drawstrings in the ankle just like the pics show. I like having the lower pockets for the things I am not going to consistently grab but have just in case. I do wish that they would breathed better though. That is my only complaint.,B00022JPNE
"got these pants and the zipper was trashed.  Unfortunately, i missed the window for return as  my work got in the way and the pants were put on the back burner so to speak.  I did purchase these for the purpose of an extra pair of work pants, but with a busted zipper i will now have to find someone to replace it as i am not a  suzy homemaker type.  I will purchase these from another source in the future such as captain mikes....",B00022JPNE
"This is what they are. The colour seems to fade a little quickly compared to some of my other camo pants, but the extra two pockets are nice.",B00022JPNE
"Great fit, i usually take between a 34 & 36 waist so the large size is perfect (I'm closer to 36 waist). If your closer to a 34 go with the medium. Drawstring closure at pant bottom don't need to worry about length. Comfortable, soft and did I mention pockets, lots of them. I will buy more.",B00022JPNE
"I had to return these because there is a reinforcing pad on the seat of the pants. It looks like a pair of horse riding pants or something to that effect. I imagine this would be a great thing to have if I was in a jungle somewhere or if everyone staring at my ass had to wear the same pants. As it pertains to my life though, I think it looks silly. I liked the material, possibly weak, but felt very comfortable. To be fair, I never wore them, so I can't speak to the quality or durability, but in my experience comfortable means weak. The size was good, I'm about a 44 waist and the 2x fit with a couple of inches to spare. I would have liked to have skipped the star rating, because I don't think it's fair for me to rate them when I never used them., but I wanted everyone to know about the butt pad so they don't waste their time as I did. And 4 stars because I think I would have loved them.",B00022JPNE
"These are good looking trousers, apparently well made and comfortable to wear. I like them so much that I will be buying more and different colors.",B00022JPNE
"This was my second pair ordered from the same vendor just a different color. If I wanted to have to alter the pants I wish there would have been an inseam question as to length. The same product in size of a different color shouldn't be over 6"" longer.",B00022JPNE
"I'll admit it--I think they look pretty cool. I use them in yoga practice during the colder months because they fit loosely. A little heavy and not the ideal slipperiness or stretchiness for yoga, but they get the job done. The rugged construction is also great for hiking. The medium size fits fine, as I expected. I've bought several pair. They last a few years.",B00022JPNE
"Had to have them hemmed since I use them like regular pants but other than that, they are great pants for work especially in the summer",B00022JPNE
"Ok, were too large for me, but similar to other
pants I've purchased like these.  Not super
thick or anything.  4 stars for bad sizing.",B00022JPNE
"I was concerned if the size would run bigger or smaller but the medium was perfect for my 32"" waist",B00022JPNE
"I wear a 32 waist size. So i ordered the medium. REAL snug, and thats with the waist sinches let out to supposedly be for a 35 waist. So if you have a 32 waist, order the large",B00022JPNE
"the pants are great but way to big. I plan to buy a smaller size right away
I like the color!!!",B00022JPNE
"Almost 5 stars.

I was skeptical, but a large would have been right for my us38 waist. Got an XL and its very roomy, which works.

As had been mentioned, these are COMFY from the beginning. Soft cotton. Also, BUTTONS, no velcro. Pockets, one each side and one on each butt cheek, then 4 cargo pockets, 2 each leg.

Tiestrings at bottom of each leg. Convenient.

Only 4 stars as I would have liked a couple smaller cargo pockets for smaller things, i.e. bluetooth headset, phone as had my previous cargo pants. Other than that, these are great. Am contemplating another pair.",B00022JPNE
"I got no issue, its what I can wear simply around town.

might go for another pear maybe , I'm pleased with it",B00022JPNE
"These are my new favorite pants. They are similar to FROG pants I wore in the Marine Corps but in my favorite color, black. Comfy, strong, good looking, functional. Get some",B00022JPNE
"the where deliverd on time but the fiting does not match with the size indicated.

I cant send it back becouse I don't have time.",B00022JPNE
"Zipper broke 2 weeks after I wore them twice. No way or fix it .

They fit good but no zipper means I can't wear them",B00022JPNE
They felt thin but they're strong and have held up fantastic. I would definitely buy more. I bought a large and I'm a 36w x 30 something length but will accomodate much longer leg.,B00022JPNE
"My wife really likes these camo's. As far as I know camo's are the ""in"" thing this time. I wore camo's as far back as 1969.",B00022JPNE
"So, when you find a pair of quality camo pants, you buy a second pair.  When I'm not working in my cubicle, I'm wearing camo cargo pants.  These seem like they will never wear out.  The are slightly large (but that's better than slightly small) for me both length-wise and waist-wise, but they're adjustable in both places (tie up the cuffs, cinch the waist).  The crotch of the pants goes low, but not too low.  And there's plenty of pockets for your wallet, keys, phone, swiss army knife, duct tape, and big league chew.  I'm only giving four stars, because they're slightly large.  BTW, I normally fit well in a pair of 32x33 pants.",B00022JPNE
"The fabric is soft and moves with you. I don't even feel the awkwardness of
cargo pockets that you feel with some pants.

Only thing is you may have to clip some excessive thread off but its from
when the seamstress doesn't cut the thread close enough. If you can get
pass that, then you will get a great pair of pants.",B00022JPNE
LIke it just fine - just as expected from the description and pictures.  Would order again in a different color.,B00022JPNE
I'm a mens size 34 and the medium fits PERFECTLY. Has the appropriate wiggle room as well. I'll be ordering a pair in every color soon. The woodland is a little darker than in the picture (that was expected) and I could not be more pleased with this.,B00022JPNE
"I READ OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PANTS THAT ITS BAGY AND BIG SO I ORDERED SMALL,I WEAR USUALLY SIZE 32-30 PANTS BUT THIS PANTS IS LONG AND SMALL WAIST AND I SAY THE SMALL IS ABOUT 28 AND 34 LONG AND BAGGY SO YOU FIGURE IT OUT WHAT YOU ORDERING FOR YOU,IM RETURNING IT MATERIAL WISE IS GOOD BUT MADE FOR SKINNY TALL GUY.",B00022JPNE
"I found these pants where far too long and wide, I don't see how people can say that these run small!",B00022JPNE
Absolutely love them. And the side drawstrings make them a perfect fit. Nice and loose but not to big. True to size. Couldn't he happier......,B00022JPNE
"This a really great pair of pants,  I first ordered a medium come to realize that they were a little snug, going to use them as my bike riding pants, plenty of pockets, good material. But I had to order me a lager for regular wearing, took a long time to shop but came in on time. Everything was fine EXCEPT one of the front pocket was completely stitched over and I can barely fit 3 fingers in it. If I undo the stitch it will also undo the stitches on the outside seam which will leave a big hole rendering the pant useless,  so for that I'm giving it a 3 star because of the additional money I'm going to have to spend to undo the pocket stitches and redo the outside seam stitches.",B00022JPNE
"Nice lightweight pants, seem to be made well but material is thinish so may not be the most durable pants you'll own.  I'm 6' with a 38"" waist and 32"" inseam.  I bought the large size and the waist fits well but the pair I got ran just a bit shorter in length than I like.  My guess is that these pants vary a fair bit from one to another.  They're made in China, like most things, and quality control may not be a strong suit.  Buyer beware, at least where the sizing is concerned.",B00022JPNE
"Ordered from Amazon for my husband to use during his fishing trips. One would expect piece of clothing designed for Paratrooper to be reliable and made out of rigid materials. However, this is not the case. Fabric is very thin, and easily ripped in one spot. Considering that pants were used only four times, I attribute this to the defect or thinness of the fabric, rather than wear of fabric because of excessive or long use. But that would be just a one problem to consider. Additionally, metal zipper literally fell apart during machine wash, despite that label states that pants are machine washable. Overall to those who consider buying these pants, I would suggest find a better product.",B00022JPNE
The fit is right on target.  I wear Levi's 569 jeans.  I would compare the fit to them as they are loose yet fitted overall.  Very good for working in the yard or hunting.,B00022JPNE
"Buy these pants you will love them, Perfect fit and I highly recommend to others, top notch quality.  Lots of pockets and really good camo color.",B00022JPNE
These vintage paratrooper pants are well made and come with adjusters so you can adjust to your individual comfort level,B00022JPNE
I wear these paratrooper pants when riding my Harley because the lagers have ties at bottom to keep them from blowing in the wind. There is two adjusters at the waist so anyone from 34 to 38 can adjust to fit great.,B00022JPNE
"I give them credit where credit is due, these are well made and authentic looking paratrooper pants, that said, they are way too small in size and I believe the problem is that they don't cme in specific size ranges only S,M,L,XL. I went to the manufacturers site to try to get a handle on what those sizes represent but to no avail they were just too small. Now they do offer straps that afford so latitude in size range but it's very limited. I was also disappointed in the width of the pant legs themselves, I expected them to have more flair to them then that had. I'm going to return these and in spite of how well made they are I am not going to try the next size up. Because of the lack of precision in sizing I would not recommend these to someone else. I know that this is a common issue with fatigues but it would seem like it would make more sense to make them in size ranges say of 2 inches rather than small fits 28-32"" waist because you really don't have 4"" of play so unless you are a perfect match it's hard to get them to fit.",B00022JPNE
"I was very satisfied with these pants and they fit great considering I was basically buying without being able to try them on. I run about 5'10"" and typically wear a 33"" waist and 30"" length in most pants. The waist on the med was perfect, the length is about an inch too long but I knew that going into the purchase and after wearing them it still works fine. Highly recommended, just pay close attention to the sizing chart.",B00022JPNE
"I just love these pants, they are incredibly comfortable and easy to wash--in the picture, they look wrinkled, but they really are very nice; no wrinkles:)",B00022JPNE
"I bought these hoping that they'd fit like some Anchor Blue cargos, but, to my dismay, they don't. I bought XL, thinking that a 40-43"" waist would be big enough. The waist seems like the right size, but the rise is not adequate and the legs taper hard and fast.
Again, I'm reviewing these for folks that rock baggy and are looking for that specific fit. When Googling, that's how I found this listing.
I liked the color.
I wouldn't purchase again.",B00022JPNE
"After reading numerous reviews that spouted how long these pants were, even though there's no inseam info given, I went ahead and ordered them anyway, my confidence boosted by several complaints that the pants were, indeed, ""too long. ""  I'm not sure in what world a 5'8"" is considered ""tall "" for a guy (these ARE men's pants, are they not?) but they were so short on me, I had flashbacks to the 70s when my pants were so short people nicknamed them ""floods,  (as in so high I was expecting a flood) .

They were so short (a 30"" inseam....I require a MINIMUM 33"" and that's considered borderline short) that I was uncomfortable enough to sacrifice my lunch half hour (of a 13 hr shift) to go home, take them off, spritz them down with water and attempt to stretch them out a bit.  I was able to squeeze a extra inch out of them that way, and when I got off of work the next morning, I put them back in the washer and instead of drying in a dryer, I've resigned myself to having to stretch by hand (and foot!) and air dry.  This gives me 2 extra inches, (so they're still about two inches short), but I lusted after these and couldn't find them anywhere else, and other than the length, they fit like a
dream...better than my old Army BDU 's.

But to set the record straight, the tag on these said a ""regular "" for the inseam, which in clothing lingo, usually translates into a mere 30"" inseam.  Definitely not the ""too long "" of prior descriptions ... unless you're under 5 feet tall...",B00022JPNE
I have been wearing cargo pants for quite sometime and these are by far my favorite. They are roomy and super comfortable. I like them so much I have ordered several pairs in different colors.,B00022JPNE
"These have started to fade after 20 washes, but the length is good the fit is not sloppy and I have had quite a few comments from the ladies. My only other concern is the cotton fabric it is made of. It seems to be comfortable, but not military style. the pants shown in the picture are not the pants that were sent. THese pants only have 2 cargo pockets instead of the four shown (the shin ones) they are also not as baggy as shown. they are more styled an fitted. I like a paratrooper pant more like the military style cloth and fit over these. Either way, i will wear these until they turn to dust or the crotch ripps out.",B00022JPNE
"To anyone that likes pants that are durable and will last for years, these pants are the way to go!!!  I have many different styles of the pants as well as colors.  I have no problems with these pants. I have had them for a while now and have purchased them previously.  I spend much of my time outdoors and I have had nothing but strength and durability.  I have had embers jump from a fire and land on my leg....lo and behold it burnt my leg but not the pants, awesome strength!!!",B00022JPNE
"I live in shorts year around, with the very few days of cooler weather, okay do not laugh, any day below 60 degrees is just too damned cold for us Arizonans when we are use to 80 plus degrees in the winter and fall and of course our Spring Weather starts at 90 to 100 degrees and Summers are usually 100 plus day above 105 to 118 degrees, Glad I have them as this was one of our colder records in the weather summaries.",B00022JPNE
"As described. Not a big fan of the S/M/L/XL sizing, I am 6'2"" and 205lbs so I like a 34""x34"" and got the LARGE. Waist is perfect (it has straps to tighten in the back) and the inseam is 32"". So they are a little shorter than I like, but they won't drag the ground so I guess it's okay in the end. Very, very soft material and pockets have plenty of room.",B00022JPNE
"Son's rating as it was a gift to him. He loves the fit, quality, and look of the fatigues. Wears them almost daily",B00022JPNE
"My husband wanted solid colored pants similar to his ACUs. These were the best I could find with his multiple pocket requirement. For comparison, he wears a Medium Long in ACUs and the Medium in these paratrooper pants were almost an exact size match. My husband is slim and 6'3"", and these fit perfectly. I hope they hold up to wash and wear.",B00022JPNE
Great pants I would recommend these in any situation. They have many pockets and are lightweight. Great pants for the money.,B00022JPNE
you will feel & look awesome in these cargo pants i have not seen any civilians with this & you cannot get these at the mall or outlet the material is super strong & pockets hold & are deep.,B00022JPNE
"I love these cargo pants. They are very comfortable. The fabric is pleasant to the touch. I have had the same also in black for several years. They are well made, and last a long time. The 8 pockets are roomy and can hold a lot of stuff. I like the flaps that makes it difficult to pick your pockets.
The side pockets are deep enough for stuff not to fall out as in some other pants I had. During the several years I have owned the same, I never lost a button, and none of the belt loops ever became detached.",B00022JPNE
"Product is very good, looks same like the picture, the person I gave the product, love it and feel very confortable on it. thanks!",B00022JPNE
"To start, I like the pants. I've been wearing Rothco so I stuck with them. Maybe I should've read the details better? They are zippered, not button fly as expected. They are extremely long, to the point where they drag ridiculously under my heels, even in boots. I bought them for snow-camo so tying them up in the woods won't matter much but after getting them I decided I wouldn't mind wearing them about town...not so much an option :(",B00022JPNE
"Difficult item to review based on the fact that two pair of the same size fit so differently.  They're well made in all other areas besides consistent fit, I suppose.  Sturdy and no holes in the pockets, and both my pair have seen some pretty hard use.  The problem lies in the fact that one pair has legs that are just right in length and girth, but the other pair has legs that seem built for someone a good 6"" taller than me with legs as big around as a redwood.  If both pair fit the same, it'd be an easy five star recommendation.  At this point, however, luck is a factor.",B00022JPNE
"Comfortable and totally functional, I do a lot of traveling and the lower pockets make for a perfect place to clear out your upper pockets for added comfort for longer flights.",B00022JPNE
Great pants great value I bought four pairs and I will be buying more.  I found the sizing chart to be accurate.,B00022JPNE
"These pants rock! I didn't know it, but I already own a pair of these with the urban camo pattern. Understand that these pants run LONG in the leg! I am tall and thin (6'1"" and 175 lbs) and am about a 31"" waist, but I was scared to get these in the 30-32"" waist size in case I gain some weight. So the waist is a bit large for me, but the pants are just perfect. I like my pant legs long, basically touching the ground when I am standing. So if you have a short and stout body type, these pants will probably not be to your liking. But for the tall and thin, they are great!",B00022JPNE
"Pretty nice pants.  The design is authentic.  BUT, the fabric is standard commercial, NOT the rip-stop/banded cloth used in field BDU's: at least, not the ones I'm familiar with.  Nonetheless, they fit as expected according to their sizing chart, and the outward design matches the field BDU's of old.

I am a ""pockets"" kind of fellow who feels lost without lots of places to store things.  This design is what I need for everyday wear.  As with GI clothing when you first get them, there are LOTS of ropes (threads) hanging.  Make sure to go over both the inside and the outside of the garment to burn them down BEFORE washing.  After the first wash, go over it again and burn any other loose ones.  Pay special attention to the stitching along the pockets inside and the buttons.  This will save you a lot of trouble later and extend the life of the garment.

As far as sizing, it is as advertised.  I'm 6'2"", 220 lbs, with a 39"" waist and a 32"" inseam.  I got the XL size, and they're perfect, the side straps take in any looseness.  The inseam on them is 33"", but with boots/shoes on, they wear just right without dragging.",B00022JPNE
These fit great and are super soft. They are very well made and feel like they will last a long time.,B00022JPNE
These are great I have no problem with these they have two adjustable straps one on each side of the hips and you can really make these fit to your hips nice and snug. I bought an X L because I have a 41 inch waste but I know I'm going to lose weight soon now that I can work out again and I like that these are adjustable and the pockets have buttons not button snaps witch I like and the material is vary good as well nice and tuff the front pockets are deep if you are looking for a great cargo pants these are the ones to get oh and the tie straps at the ankles are vary good as well.,B00022JPNE
These trousers fit just perfect they are flexible and be worn without a belt with the adjustable tabs on the sides.,B00022JPNE
All theese ultra force pants problem is SIZE.As its known they fit 31-35 inch waste but they really r 35 inch and got som craps on waste they lower size and its very uncomfortable. New black 1 of theese pants looks lika 1 year used. collor really made me cry,B00022JPNE
"I never tried this item.  It seemed to be as described; however, it was an incorrect size.  I ordered size 36 and received size 28.  I returned the item.  Refund by Amazon was nearly as fast as I could 'blink!'",B00022JPNE
"I am 5'10 female, 140 pounds and typically wear a 34"" inseam.  I can't tell you how many different types of camo pants I tried before FINALLY finding these!  Finding fatigues that were long enough that weren't an awkward fit was nearly an impossible task.  Although the waist on these is higher than I would normally wear or like, they look great.  The material is a little rough, but again, I'm so happy with the fit that that isn't an issue.  Very happy with this purchase :-)",B00022JPNE
"thinner material than the original pants I bought, zipper won't stay up, can't see them lasting very long, not as long either",B00022JPNE
"Not made as well as the first pair I bought, the stone washed, material is not as thick and the zipper won't stay up, shorted in length also",B00022JPNE
"I purchased these pants after an accident and they are super ! Since I have limited mobility and can only carry so much; the numerous pockets provide me with all the storage space I need. For things like my wallet, cell phone,mp3 payer, smokes, snacks, reading material and anything a person would need for commute and travel.

I only have two complaints. The the pockets above the knees have a large storage space but their too loose and items can fall out. The second complaint is a pro/con. The thick material is good for everyday activity and protective against the cold but any day above 65* is a different story. Feels like your in a sauna.",B00022JPNE
"Initially I ordered the wrong size (the run big), it was easy to return the wrong size, I just reordered, returned the incorrect ones and they refunded the original price and waived the normal restocking fee, which was great - thank you.

Now that I have the correct size, they are perfect, just what I was looking for@",B00022JPNE
"I just received my trouser's yesterday, and I'm located in an austere location and the vintage 8 trousers are a very comfortable fit. I would recommend these trouser's to others.",B00022JPNE
I bought these to go with my woodland camo blouse (jacket) and they match very well. Lots of pockets. I will definitely buy these again.,B00022JPNE
They are pretty good a little smaller than I thought but the material is good. They are perfect for Halloween,B00022JPNE
"Great pants, great style for working as a contractor (need all those pockets) I just ordered the wrong size so I am exchanging them.",B00022JPNE
"I though the size would be fine or maybe a little big, but I could have fit two of me in there.  The pants are nice and have great pockets.",B00022JPNE
"Better than 3 stars but not a full 4. The size fit me perfectly. I'm a size 36 and I got the 35-39 size so I just tightened it on the waist straps and it was fine.

The straps were difficult to adjust because it seemed stuck and the bottom part of the pants were bigger than I wanted. The bottoms are like bootcut jeans and I would have liked it a little more fitted for the purpose I bought them for.",B00022JPNE
"this is my second pair of these vintage paratrooper pants. The last pair was dark brown. I like the versatility and comfort. The extra two pouches at the bottom come in handy and give the pants a rugged look. They are well made and can take a beating. They do run a little baggy, but they are cargo pants and are meant to give room for movement. I will definitely buy a third pair sooner or later.",B00022JPNE
"Sizing is an issue with this product.  I read previous reviews and that assisted me with selecting the correct size.  My waist is about 36 inches and the large pants fit me well.  Problem is the inseam which is made for someone about 6'6"" and I am 5'11"".  Good news is they have drawstrings in the ankles and you can tie these and keep them from hanging under the bottom of your boots.  The pants fit loosely and are very comfortable.  The leg pockets are made as such to secure any items you put into them will not fall out if you are performing tactical operations.  These pants are high quality and you will not be displeased with this product once you select the proper size.  If they are slightly large in the waist or you loose weight, they have drawstrings on the side of the pants which can reduce the waist size about two inches if needed.  Buy these pants, get the correct size and you will not be disappointed.  >>>",B00022JPNE
"Size was a little big but they have draw string that make a snug fit. Excellent camo pants, very durable.",B00022JPNE
I bought these a while ago from amazon and just went back on to order more. I love them. Great for the winter months.,B00022JPNE
"The pants arrived in 2 days

I wear a 44 waist wrangler loose fit jean and these fit dead on. Love the extra pockets and the light weight material. Very comfortable.",B00022JPNE
"I am 5'1"" and 125 pounds.  I ordered small.  The waist was too tight, the butt, hips, and thighs were too baggy, and the length was too long.  The seat of the pants has a round patch of fabric.  It looks a bit weird.  I will be returning them.",B00022JPNE
"Overall I would say not bad for working in but not that great to look at, very good price over all",B00022JPNE
"After reading some of the reviews, I was at first worried about ordering. Then I realized everyone has different ways of judging fit. I am about a 40 - 42 and I ordered an XL. They fit great. They are long but that's the style. I will be ordering again.",B00022JPNE
This is AWESOME! If you hike this is very comfortable! This is one of my favorites now! I like so much am going to buy one in kaki and other in coyote!,B00022JPNE
i've got several pair of 5.11 tac lite pro but at $50 / per pair I was looking for an alternative. the fit is nice but big maybe try a size down from what you think you are.  very tough and easy to clean. pockets are deep but i still like my 5.11 better.,B00022JPNE
"These pants feel like they will last for a quite a while. Love the double stitch for the knee and the 8 pockets! Only thing i disliked was that it came just a tiny bit too long. If you are 5'7 and weigh around 120-140, I recommend the size small. These will come a little too big or a little too big. All in all, I am satisfied with these pants :)",B00022JPNE
"I bought these pants and instantly wanted to be a paratrooper. No lie. The amount of pockets (8), make these the most luxurious pants you can own. Have a blast putting things in pockets, it won't get old.",B00022JPNE
Pants are very poor quality for the price. They should be half the cost. $15 would be reasonable. Would not order again.,B00022JPNE
"Paratrooper pants are well constructed, and have that we'll worn look without appearing old and discarded. I am a consistent 34 waist and these were a little snug but fit okay.",B00022JPNE
Use these for yard work mostly!  Very comfortable and functional but drawback is they were very warm in the crotch area and in humidity created moisture in that region.,B00022JPNE
"This is my second pair I ordered. I love the first pair in olive drab so I ordered these. I ordered a large and they fit just right. I'm 5'10"" 205 pounds.",B00022JPNE
"These camo pants are fantastic! I have been looking for some authentic-styled camo pants for camping/hiking, or just working on projects around the house. Note: the product sizes offered (S, M, L, etc.) make it difficult to know what size to get, but the sizing chart is Amazon's generic sizing chart (so don't count on that too closely). Here's a little help. I ordered the Medium and the actual tag on the pants is for waist size ranges 31"" - 35"". There are 2 adjustment straps on the waist to make them smaller if needed. No actual length is listed, however ordered 3 pairs in different colors and all were consistently sized with length of 34"". I typically wear a 34"" (waist) x""30 (length) and these fit perfectly with the waist tabs expanded all the way, so if you're a 35 waist, or tight 34 keep that in mind. Also, I took care of length with a trip to my seamstress (and kept the ties), but with the ties on the bottom length isn't as much of an issue if you don't mind a little extra bulkiness. Thighs and seat are looser/roomy and overall these are so comfortable I frequently just wear them every day or for lounging around the house.  I'll be back for more!",B00022JPNE
"I bought this for hiking.  It's durable and comfortable.  The fit is a bit awkward and I had to adjust it, but for the price, it was right.",B00022JPNE
"These are sized wrong. I remember trying a size medium and ended up giving them away as they were way too big (That was an exchange for size large). So I decided to try again with a size small. I couldn't even get them on. Plus the waist in these are very high (almost up to your chest, definitely completely over the stomach). I'm on the thin side and can't wear that style.",B00022JPNE
"I used these for a camping trip that featured a lot of rain. Some don't like cotton clothing for this situation - they think it doesn't dry out. I didn't observe this myself. Comparing these with rip-stop nylon that I also wore, I preferred these.",B00022JPNE
"I love these. pockets a plenty, soft and very comfortable. This is great for long drives or hike. light material but still  durable",B00022JPNE
Great pants I've had mine for 18 months only problem I encountered was the bottom became frayed beyond repair. I ended up cutting them into shorts. They are pretty baggy and they feel more like pajamas then your normal cargo pants. I wore them in the dead of winter to the hot humid summer and they are great.,B00022JPNE
"Pants were cute, sturdy and true to size.  True to size, I wear a 4 in jeans and ordered a small.  Bought for workout, but they are a little heavy for this.  They are much like true military pants.",B00022JPNE
These are very nice pants.  Over the past three or four years I have probably purchased about 10 pairs.  My son loves them!,B00022JPNE
I had been looking for a nice set of Camo Fatigues for a trip to Wisconsin. I was looking for a nice fitting pair with pockets on the side. It was suprisingly difficult to find a good pair. These worked perfectly. Great quality.,B00022JPNE
I can't say too much because I can't wear them. Just buy the size that is standard. If you typicaly by large pants. Don't buy mediums because the size chart says so. Just buy large.,B00022JPNE
"Better than I would have thought. They looked good in the image, and they are even better on me. I was surprised I got such a nice pair for the money. They could charge more money, but I hope they don't. I over pay for crap so often its nice to get something good for a low price.

Sizes run a little small. Order one size bigger if you are close to the next size up on the chart. Odds of getting the right fit are better this way.",B00022JPNE
these are comfortable and have plenty of pockets.  they are rugged and yet lightweight.  they run a little big but then again they are cargo pants. I am going to buy a second pair.,B00022JPNE
"Size is a major issue with these trousers.
These are heavy cottons & not the ripstop pattern.
Scale down a notch while picking your size.
But you can't beat a Propper or Tru Spec when it come to camo clothing.
My advice: Stick to Propper, 5.11 or Tru Specs.",B00022JPNE
Excellent fitting and incredibly comfortable pants. Plenty of packets and look great to boot. Great for general wear or for a weekend in the woods. All around just good pants.,B00022JPNE
"They feel very comforable and fit very well.  The material isn't the best but more of a low quality cotton.  Not bad for the price though, beats paying over $100 at a sporting goods store.",B00022JPNE
"These are probably my favorite pair of pants. I usually wear Kuhl pants, but now that I have these, I find myself wishing I had more! These pants are my goto pants, I wear them hiking, geocaching, day trips around Europe, etc... They are as comfortable as a pair of pants could be. I was nervous after reading some reviews that these pants would be cheap, raggedy and falling apart. My pair fit me perfectly, buttons are on nice and strong, nothing frayed, overall, I am very happy with these pants. I will be ordering more in different colors very soon.",B00022JPNE
"had to return, won't trust to reorder. size should be fairly simple to get right...more words? ordered large and got small.",B00022JPNE
"I have been looking for cargo pants for work, and most of what I kept finding were the ""fashion"" cargos (so disappointing). But I found this pair after many days of scouring the interwebs - and I couldn't be happier! They are sturdy, but still pretty comfortable. the color is great, the amount of pockets are great. My only issue is the waist - they have side cinchers to help with that ""fitted"" feel, and yes, it helps with the gapping in the back, but it makes the front uncomfortably tight. Other than that, these have become a favorite of mine!",B00022JPNE
Cut too low in the middle.  If they were a hotel they would be a nice one... given the ample ball room.  Disappointed as I liked the look.,B00022JPNE
Great pants. Bought them for paintball. Got a small but a little to long. Great color. I will see how they hold up with paintball this Sat,B00022JPNE
Comfy pants. The one issue is they run small in the waist. I'm a barely a 34w and the mediums are tight. I'm getting a large next time.,B00022JPNE
"IT TOOK A COUPLE OF TRYS TO GET THE RIGHT SIZE BUT IT WAS WORTH IT
WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING SOME RETRO PANTS",B00022JPNE
"Originally ordered a large since it said covered 34-38 waist. Wear 36-38 normally and these were almost snug. The length was about a 32"" and I wear a 34 since I like them to drop to almost floor in back. These were at floor in my bare feet so wouldve been too short w/ shoes. Returned hassle free and ordered XL, which are a little too big at waist even w/ the ties pulled all the way but length was good so kept them. Washed them and no shrinkage so possibly could have used the large ones after all but happy w these anyway. Nice medium wt fabric but color not true brown, more olive brown.",B00022JPNE
"I'm 6' 0"" about 175 lbs with no body fat and the Mediums are a perfect fit. I knew the L would be too big, and these seem just right. The Khaki color is really solid and the Paratrooper pockets are a must. I love these better than my BDU's Cargo Pants.",B00022JPNE
"Price was very fair, sizing was perfect, product was good quality.  Hard to find the old school bdus anymore even at a army/navy store anymore without spending an arm and a leg.",B00022JPNE
iT DID NOT FALL APART RECIEVED IN GOOD CONDITON THANKS wHY SO MANY WORDS IT'S  IT'S GOOD SO WHAT ELSE CAN i SAY,B00022JPNE
"Great quality BDU knockoff (Rothco)  These pant sizes run BIG large is 34 - 39. Im 6""00 170 lbs and there a lil big for my preference. Usually size 34 pants i wear without a belt, so I got large since I bought Volcom loose fit 34 jeans and i couldn't even get in them. My boy who is 220 lbs could probably wear these.  Maybe 10 years ago in HS i would dig the baggy look.  They shrink a little when washed.  If i got them for paintball or airsoft I would go with large because of mobility,  When i get another pair in brown probably gonna go with medium. Even tho the measurments are fqd up they still get 5 stars",B00022JPNE
"Seem to be well-made, but the sizing is all off. The inseam was supposed to be 29 1/2 to 31; it was 34. The waist measure was equally off. These pants seem to be worth the money, but you may have to exchange them several times to find the proper fit.",B00022JPNE
"other than the fact that they got a little discolored, i am in love with these, will be buying more!",B00022JPNE
"Ive had numerous pair of fatigues over the years and theyve always had a short length. Ive FINALLY find a pair that has a 32-33"" length! They fit great. Im 6'1"" / 220lbs and ordered the XL and they fit like a glove.",B00022JPNE
"I wear these often and they are very comfortable and durable.  The waist has more belt loops than most pants (jeans) and that is a handy feature.  The pockets work well as expected and...the waist is able to adjust quite a bit in case you lose or gain a few pounds after purchasing them.  Good pants, good price.",B00022JPNE
Camo is fashionable this season and they are Great vintage yet stylish pants. I had to pull them high on my waist because of the cut however.,B00022JPNE
"These are very comfortable and yet durably made.  lot o pockets, waist adjustment tabs, drawstrings at bottom cuff.  Feels like a quality product and sizing seems correct.",B00022JPNE
"This is made of good quality material and fits great, true to size.  You won't be disappointed with this Purchase.",B00022JPNE
. Sent  not only the wrong color but the wrong pants and they are not even hemmed. What the hell,B00022JPNE
"Material felt a little bit thin to me for the money, but other than that pretty good. Get a size bigger than you think, they have adjustments on the back to tighten them up a little bit.",B00022JPNE
"I'm a 40 or so depending on where I wear my trou, so I figured XL should do me. I have a pair of 'Nam Tiger Stripe look-a-likes by the same maker in XL and they're perfect... a little tension on the side pulls a they're as comfy as can me... These bears on the other hand, I have to cinch the side pulls tight or I'm looking like some gang banger with my drawers at mid knee. Go figure. I'd return them for the Large, but my luck stinks so why bother. If you're toting a 40"" waistline, get to the gym or take your chances with these in XL",B00022JPNE
"Very easy to move when I'm wearing it, I can put more little work kits in the pocket which exactly what I need for work. And affordable price.",B00022JPNE
"buenas tardes , gracias por enviar el producto esta en buen estado y execelente articulo Woodland Camo Vintage Paratrooper Fatigues, Medium",B00022JPNE
"It's a very rough material, should stand up to heavy wear. It's ufortunate that there isn't exact sizing like jeans.",B00022JPNE
My only complaint is that the waistband doesn't really keep it's shape and rolls up unless you're using a belt.,B00022JPNE
I bought these for caving and they worked good enough. I think next time time will go with normal BTUs though. Looks and fits good if you do not plan on taking these through some rough environments.,B00022JPNE
"And I'm still wearing them five years later. They're just starting to get a couple of frayed spots from wear, but for the money you cannot beat these camo pants. I just ordered a second pair that I'll work into my rotation. I'm female, 5'3"" and weigh 120 lbs and I ordered a small. They fit perfectly. I don't use the ties at the ankles, so I just removed them and they look like normal hemmed pants. Great durable pants. Cool look. Great for kicking around in.",B00022JPNE
"I ordered these pants as a light weight, easy wear, yoga type pants.  They are light weight cotton, run a little large but that is totally fine.  I ordered 2 pair and am relatively happy, HOWEVER they need better quality control.  The cohocolate brown pair had some incomplete stitching, and consequently a hole, in the inner seam.  Very annoying and disappointing to find there is basically a hole/split in the pants before you get to wear them. Nice pants BUT check the quality and look for incomplete stitching before first wear.",B00022JPNE
"I ordered a couple pair of these tried them on and ended up ordering a pair of every color.
I wear a size 34 in the waist and Medium fit me perfect. I ordered large at first and gave them to my brother because they were really loose.
I'm satisfied. I'm thinking about buying more before they sell out or stop making them.",B00022JPNE
"Well, I got a couple pairs of these pants to use for PT.  I really like them.  They're very comfortable and have held up really well so far.  Sizing runs pretty standard.  I wear a 32-34 and the medium fit me very well.  Adjustable waist tabs work really well.  They don't slip or anything, so the waist is easy to adjust.",B00022JPNE
"Couple things you lads need to consider... leg ties are fabric style versus cord style found on other Rothco product. These are twill, not rip-stop nylon, so they're not going to breathe when it's steamy but is a plus in the chill... These have a zipper fly which this reviewer prefers over those pesky button types.

Lastly, beware the waist size. Where they mention the minimum, that's with the side tabs cinched as tight as can be. Means major pucker-age on the waist band which I find uncomfortable. Curiously, rip-stop style fit better ... I'm a 39-40 depending on how I wear them. I opted for the XL on these and will pray they shrink, yet same size on Rothco rip-stop fits real comfy. Vendor was quick, pricing competitive and yep, arrives in a poly-bag our letter carrier crammed into the mailbox...",B00022JPNE
I have a few pairs and they have lasted many years. There are pockets for all of my gadgets. Very good quality.,B00022JPNE
"Comfortable. NOT HEAVY DUTY but seem tough enough for use if you don't need reinforced knees and hems. Useless drawstrings at bottom. Run a little long. Perfect for Dexter costume, many complements with immediate recognition. Buy these. Worn on Saturday mornings too for comfort. Extra free advice. Buy American Apparel Olive thermal Henley if you are going for the Dexter bit as well as black Diamondplate? latex gloves (available on amazon too- I use these all the time working on my car and house)",B00022JPNE
"Very well made. Comfortable materiel.
I usually wear a 34x34. Ordered the large.

"Stylish, versatile, comfortable pants. Very useful. Made in China but I am noticing that country is begining to proviode better quality and style than many US based companies. Not garrish or cheap at all.",B00022JPNE
These are extremely comfortable and well made. The fit is dead on to size. 5 stars IF the pockets used velco or buttons as opposed to a small snap.,B00022JPNE

"So far, I have a pair of ""Brown"" which is more like brownish dark olive drab... and a pair of ""Khaki"".  I love these pants!!!  I will be getting a couple more colors, probably ""Russet Brown"" and ""Black"".  They fit great once you hem the excess length.  I bought this line of pants for the extra pockets below the knees.  Those pockets work great phone smart phones when sitting down (if you otherwise keep it in a back pocket).  In general, I think these are the most comfortable pants I own.",B00022JPNE
"As a soldier, I spend the better portion of my time in uniform, and over the years, I've come to appreciate the durability, convenience, and comfort of my combat pants.  I have wanted a pair of civilian pants that would be nearly identical to what I am issued, and the Rothco Camouflage Vintage Paratrooper Cargo Pants are exactly what I was looking for.  They are great for camping, fishing, hiking, and most other outdoor activities, and seem to be warmer than most jeans.  I would also highly recommend these pants to any contractors/ manual laborers, as they have plenty of pocket space, and the option to blouse your boots with the drawstrings, so you don't snag yourself on equipment/ scaffolding.  So far they have proved themselves to be very durable.  These pants are well worth the price.",B00022JPNE

"Overall these are the worst pair of pants I have ever bought I have always had trouble finding the right pair of pants for me, because I have a small waist and fairly longer legs. I bought the medium pair of pants and it said size 30 - 32 the pants I buy usually are 30""32"" these were far from what was advertised. The pant legs were 32 - 35 inches long, (they were 35 with no way of making them shorter). The enseam was 29 1/2 to 32 1/2 and was definetly 32 1/2 also with no way of shrinking them. With a belt and much maintence on the pant legs they were finally the right size, I chose not to return to them because as mentioned in previous reviews they charge you for the return and I wasn't going to give them more money for their poor advertising. Also I got the brown pants and they were A LOT darker then advertised in the picture overall I was very unsatisified with this product. I chose to give them a 2 star because the pants are fairly comfortable, also I would like to mention that the picture shown for the brown pants looks nothing like the actual pants you get I doubt that the pants shown in the picture are actually sold by this company because those pants actually look like good pants unlike the pants I got.",B00022JPNE
"this  is really good product. got 2 of this olive drab and brown. just great pants, loose, comfortable, got 4 good pocket and etc. really worth 40 $",B00022JPNE
"As others have said, the sizing of these is remarkably inconsistent.  I bought two pairs (in different colors) and each fit differently and ran small.  The waist wasn't tight at all, but the legs/thighs were and thoroughly diminished the possibility of actually using any of the pockets and cargo pockets.

In addition to small and inconsistent sizing, the pants just do not seem well made at all.  I've seen similar generic/no-name cargo pants sitting on the racks of places like Ross, Marshall's, etc., for far less that were made far better than these.  The fabric is thin and the ""vintage"" aspect is simply another way of telling you that these have been washed with pumice stone (I found a couple in the pockets of the ones I received), which only add to the general feeling of how low-quality the fabric is.  If it was low-quality to begin with, in this case, washing it with pumice stones does nothing to help it and only showcases how low-quality and non-durable the pant is.

Returned mine.",B00022JPNE
"it is very to put in 20 words the rothco paratrooper were not big enough i selected an xlarge size they sent me xlarge, it said xlarge on the pants bu

the pant i ordered and the pants tha i received were not the same they sent me xlarge but it fit like a size 32 waist so i gave them away.

"I purchased four of these pants, in various colors, back in 2009.  I am currently still wearing these pants on a day to day basis.  They are soft and light.  I wouldn't recommend wearing them in a snow storm, but they are great pants for working, hiking, and general outdoors activities.  Three years and still kicking, these pants are great.",B00022JPNE

"Should have known better.

Fabric is really soft like its been washed 100 times. The black/white is crisp and sharp but the shades of grey are all faded, not crisp at all.... again like they've been washed 100 times.
Overall just feel cheap.
I should have searched longer and further than amazon. Quickly found some actual Propper BDUs for 80% the cost of these imitations. Lesson learned.",B00022JPNE
"I bought these to do yard work, so I wanted something sturdy and comfortable. I actually purchased two different styles - these vintage paratrooper fatigues and also the vintage style vietnam fatigues, both made by Rothco and both in the same size.  I got the size that I usually wear, small.  According to the tags in both pairs of pants, size small regular fits waist sizes 27"" to 31"" with a length from 29 1/2 to 32 1/2.

These paratrooper pants run small.  They fit a lot snugger than the vietnam style fatigues in the same size.  The legs are narrower and fit a lot ""closer to the body"" than the vietnam style.  The waist size also is smaller and fits tighter, even though the size listed on the tags of both styles is identical.  There are adjustment tabs on the side to adjust waist size.  By way of comparison - the waist on the Vietnam style fatigues fit most comfortably for me with the adjustment tabs cinched about 1/4 of the way on both sides.  These paratrooper fatigues fit best without cinching the tabs at all - and even then they fit slightly tighter than I would like.

According to the tag, these pants are a cotton blend, but they feel like cotton to me.  The fabric is mid-weight and slightly stiff feeling.  They come out of the dryer pretty much wrinkle free. They are reinforced in the knees and seat and have double stitched seams.  They do seem very sturdy. The pockets are roomy and they button closed to prevent things from falling out.  There are ties at the bottom of the legs which you can pull tight to adjust the length and prevent you from stepping on the hem.  (the length on both styles of pants seems to be the same).

Overall, these are nice sturdy pants (keep in mind that they run a little small). For overall comfort, however, I like the Vietnam style better because the fabric is less stiff and the legs are wider and not as snug to the body. The paratrooper style comes in many more colors, however, and they come out of the dryer wrinkle free while the Vietnam style comes out looking a little rumpled.  In the end, I decided to keep both styles, but ended up buying an extra pair of the Vietnam style.",B00022JPNE
"I own four pairs of these pants at this point, and have designs on purchasing more.  These pants are comfortable, and extremely durable.  There are enough pockets to carry what you need to get you through the day, or to gear up for a a trip down range.  Can't say enough about this product.",B00022JPNE
"I got my pants today and they fit great. I was a bit worried because the sizing chart is a little confusing but based on another review I choose ""large"" and it worked out. I have a 37"" waist and I love the fit, not to tight or to loose. A large would fit anyone between 36""-38"". I do have one concern, - the belt loops seem a little small and some what inadequate for a pants like these. I'm gonna keep my review at five stars and edit it if the belt loops break.",B00022JPNE
"Nice comfy pants. Lost a star, because I thought they would be a little thicker material. Good for sport wear and hanging out, don't think they will go to carbine classes with me.",B00022JPNE
"The most comfortable pants I own. Old stock yes, but that makes them even better in my opinion. I will definitely buy more.",B00022JPNE
These are a nice pair of pants. They are a little then in places but are reenforced were it counts. For the price they are tough to beat.,B00022JPNE
"The Stone Vintage Paratrooper fatigues are great in photos but if you are not
a first responder or use these pants for utility purposes this will not be a
functional pair of pants. I have owned the columbia brand and the fit is
totally different. I rarely even think about returning any clothes but I had
to actually return these pants. The XL is actually a 42. You would require a
large in this style and color to fit a 38-40 and not look like a clown.

I just realize that the only items I can't purchase online are clothes.

6' 185lbs. Can shop off the rack without alterations. 38-40 in pants.
And I don't wear tight fitting clothes or baggy clothes falling off my
backside. Hope this assists in your search for a comfortable pair of
pants that you can wear and not have to be a first responder of reliving
being in the military.",B00022JPNE
"First of all, sizing is way off. I usually wear medium everything, so I got a medium of this, but it's HUGE.

Second, and this is the most important part: The description on the page says ""cotton,"" but the actual item, on the label, is made of 55% cotton and 45% polyester. I could have gotten basic poly twill blend stuff for $20 or less at a surplus store. Don't bother with these.",B00022JPNE
"Nice pair of pants, but the sizing is on the very big size.  I usually wear XL, here size L was the right size.",B00022JPNE
"Love these pants, sizing really isn't that big of an issue as long as you know your true waist size. Waist is at the belly button, not the hips. These pants button and zipper up to right around your belly button. If you are concerned about size as far as being too tight around that area, get one size up they can be adjusted, kind of like a built in belt. If you are concerned about length and the pants being too long, the strings at the bottom can be tied so that they don't drag on the floor. These pants are made for physical labor and not style.",B00022JPNE
"The zipper broke the first day I wore them.  Come on. I expect some durability out of any garment, especially something called ""paratrooper pants"". No return business. Less than one star.",B00022JPNE
"easy review here. I am a 34-36"" waist with a 32"" inseam. I ordered a large and they fit good in the waist, they have ""tightening clips"" in the back to get exact... and about a 34"" inseam, which to me is okay because they go over boots anyway. So perfect fit for me.",B00022JPNE
I am love'n these paratrooper pants. I have been wearing then a lot now and they are way comfortable. Great wash and wear.,B00022JPNE
"These are very nice fatigue pants.  Reinforced in the knees and seat, which is crucial if you're in the outdoors. Very soft, but appear durable.  Better check on the sizing before you buy them. They run a little big in the waist. I normally wear a 38/34,  but I chose the XL, which is 40 waist.  The Large would have only given me a 32 length, which is a little short for me.  The XL goes to around 33 in length.  Good thing they had pull straps on each side, you can reduce the waist size drastically. Once you pull the tabs, they fit fine.

All in all, a good product. I've ordered more.",B00022JPNE
"These are decent pant but if you're in the market for 100% cotton ripstop BDUs, these are not what you're looking for. If you're looking for Cotton/Poly blend you can generally get a better deal elsewhere.
Description states: cotton which is misleading. Should read cotton/poly. I don't believe these are milspec. The other milspec BDUs I have all had button fly - these are zippered.

These are made in China and the stitching is sloppy. Of course, that's not directly related to being made in China. Comparing to Propper brand BDUs these just don't compare.
I suggest these instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Olive-Cotton-Ripstop-BDU-Pants/dp/B001EIYY8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Olive Cotton Ripstop BDU Pants</a>
Propper also makes a poly/cotton blend which is more durable but less comfy than the all cotton and cheaper than these.

I am returning mine.",B00022JPNE
"the product is nice! although i was running in them for a few, and had my touch screen phone in the pocket, somehow it made black marks on the outside of the pants in the shape of my phone, you can see where the camera was, and everything.. hope this helps. ohhh and not pure cotton at all!!!!!!!",B00022JPNE
"I have a 38 inch waist and I got a XL size which was too big for me but the adjustable straps at the back made it fit just right. would recommend to get one size smaller for a more better fit. Quality is pretty top notch however these aren't authentic(I think it's mentioned on the description some where) but still pretty nice looking pants with lots of pockets. My one complain is that when i kneel on a hard surface, one of the seams would press against my leg and it hurts. However that is a small issue as I seldom kneel anyway.",B00022JPNE
"This is my third pair of these pants, one in stone, one in brown and one in khaki. They are very comfortable. My only gripe is the durability of these as the stone pants zipper broke (after 1 yr) and the brown pants are tearing at the bottom but that may be due to excessive wear so i am willing to overlook it and buy another pair. I did have one initial grip that when the stone pair came the rear pocket was sewn closed with inconsistent quality, but the other two pairs of pants were good from the start.",B00022JPNE
"Good pants for the price. Seem to be well-crafted and durable, though I've only washed them twice. I plan to purchase additional pants now that I've seen what they're like.",B00022JPNE
"Waist size, length, durability, color, design... this is perfect for this price range !!  There are two pockets on the thigh, and also two pockets just below/around the knees.  Super cool design.  I think I will get the black one also.  The ones I bought at Gap or Oldnavy looks like I bought it there.  This one looks very authentic, unlike the commercial ones.  Has a nice string to tie the bottom of the pants.  Stitching at the butt is unique and makes it look very durable and real.  All in all, this is definitely worth the price and I strongly recommend it !!!",B00022JPNE
"these pants are soft, comfy and don't smell like a chemical factory like many other camo pants do even after repeated washings.
very happy with them",B00022JPNE
"dont know what else to say. absolutely perfect. well made, the most comfortable pants i own.  i don't know what everyone is complaining about with the sizes - the chart is pretty accurate.  the reason there is such a gap with waist sizes is because there is a (for lack of a better word) drawstring on each size to snung them up..  i normally buy 38"" waist jeans, cause i wear them loose. im probably a 37"" or 36"" waist, but i want room for comfort and long underwear during the winter..  if you are the largest number on the waist, you may wanna think about going one size up for room - just a thought. i bought the x-large pants and they fit perfect.  snugged up the sides, and can be worn without a belt. open them up, and i can fit 2 layers underneath and still be comfortable. the length is perfect for me. usually i get 34 lenght, cause i like room.  these are probably about that. you gotta keep 2 thing in mind - first, these are meant to fit different sized people, and they do a very good job of that. second - these are not suit pants - so stop your whinning..  how you cant give these 5 stars is beyond me - stop your complaining people..  they are pants for christ sake..  i cant see how you could expect something better than these and im pretty picky. they are also a thin material.. and thats good in my eyes. lightweight, COMFORTABLE, easy to move around in..  perfect for the outdoors. don't expect them to be thermal pants - they are not meant to be.  they are EXACTLY what they are suppose to be. i will be buying more.",B00022JPNE
"My MIL-SPEC sizing is S/R for my stats: male, 5' 7"", 170 lbs (I wear jeans/pants sized 31 X 30, I'm very active and am the gym 5 or 6 days a week). According to the size chart I'm right on the cusp of the small and medium - I went with the small. After trying them on I've found that the waist is snug, not overly tight or loose, and the length is a bit long (nothing hemming can't fix). I'm not sure if they will shrink as they age due to repeated washing/drying. Overall, the pants are well made and very comfortable.",B00022JPNE
"All good and very pleased. The pants are in good quality and they are cheap as well. I'm a old school skater, and skate shops a so expensive, so this is a very nice buy.
A big thanks from Norway.

Cheers!",B00022JPNE
"after reading many of the reviews on these pants, i was hoping for the best when i ordered the mediums.  i am 32x32 and these fit great.  the tag lists these as medium regular - waist 31"" to 35"", inseam 29 1/2"" to 32 1/2,"" 55% cotton/45% polyester.  for me neither the side cinches nor the drawstrings at the bottom of the pants legs are necessary because the size is adequate enough for me.  i may end up cutting both off if they get in the way.  the front pockets are not as deep as i am used to, but are more than sufficient to hold my keys and money clip.  the rear and thigh pockets both are fastened with two buttons, one at each side of the flap.  the lower pockets each have one button in the middle.  the knees and seat are reinforced.  my first impression was that the material was lighter than expected, but after wearing them, they are nearly a perfect weight.  i ordered the black and will order a few more pair in the other colors offered.",B00022JPNE
These are awesome. Exactly what I wanted. And I received the item three business days after ordering. Overall an excellent purchase.,B00022JPNE
"I had no problem with the ""ODD SIZES"" maybe im the ""RIGHT"" person... or maybe i just know what size i am because my mother doesn't dress me anymore. good pair of pants. i do a lot of crawling climbing walking threw water and the terrain i generally find myself in is unlike terrain many of you will ever see. these pants have held up and one of the best things about them is they actually stay bloused in your boots if you so choose which ive had issues with other pants coming undone. i personally gave it 4 stars because i feel there are far too many pockets! some would like that as for me, i don't see the need for 4 cargo pockets when 2 will do just fine.",B00022JPNE
"Love the multiple pockets; very functional pair of pants.

NOT a fan of the width of the pants.  It feels like I am wearing a pants that is waaaaay to big even though the fit at the waist is comfortable (bought size 32 by 32).  If you have a normal size butt, this is going to be way too big for you.",B00022JPNE
"This pants are really comfy, the only problem with them is they are sized abit large. According to the size chart if you have a 33"" waist you should get a medium size pant, it was too big for me. Something like this is really a hit or miss, thing.",B00022JPNE
"I couldn't ask for a better pair of pants for what I needed!  These are roomy, and VERY comfortable.  I have found no issues at all with the pants, and I would purchase these again.  Being camo, I know they probably aren't real stylish, but I wear one of the 2 pairs I bought whenever possible.",B00022JPNE
"I am typically a size 4 in everything.  I ordered a small in these pants based on reviews indicating the pants run very large.  This was not the case for me.  A small was entirely too tight.  Based on the pants I got, I would need a large to fit.  I am pretty sure a medium would still be too tight.  It's unfortunate as I was very excited about these pants.",B00022JPNE
I purchased these pants hoping they would fit like the Battle Dress Uniform trousers I wore when I was an Airman in the United States Air Force.  I was impressed with the comfort & maneuverability of these pants.  I would definitely recommend them to other customers.,B00022JPNE

i ordered xl 40-43, my xl was tagged xl 28-31.",B00022JPNE
"I read a lot of the reviews here before deciding to buy these pants.  I was a little worried about complaints concerning the zipper, but I decided to give them a try.  I'm very happy with the pants.  They fit great, are easily adjustable, and feel soft and comfortable.  But others were right about the zippers!  They sometimes get stuck halfway up, and it can be a little difficult to get them free again.  Not a huge deal, more of an inconvenience really, but still... I mean, how long has the zipper been around?  100 years or more?  You'd think it would be perfected by now.  At least the problem seems to be getting better as the pants wear in.

I'm very satisfied with them overall.  I'd be even more satisfied with a better zipper.",B00022JPNE
"I purchased three pair of these pants.  I like the fit and feel.  No problem there.  However I have some concerns about possible quality issues.  Time will time.  The zipper in particular does not move up and down its track easily.  This issue seems to appear to varying degrees on all three pair.  The fact that these are made in China is also annoying - though THAT issue is hard to get away from these days.  And I could put up with the China issue better if the zipper flowed smoothly up and down its track.  I just hope that they hold up for a reasonable amount of time.  Oh, I wear these in an office setting or about town so if they don't hold up it isn't because of hard wear on my part.  (We can't make things in America anymore???)  I like the style and fit - again, time will tell...",B00022JPNE
"Bought these in olive small. (Male, 148 lbs,, 5'8"", short inseam.)

Plusses:
* Look good. If you have a slender waist, they will accentuate it.
* Comfortable.
* Pockets placed well, so that items in them don't tend to chafe while walking or moving.
* Sturdy so far (a couple of weeks, lots of wear).
* Very flexible--I can stretch, run, or whatever in them.
* Adjustable waist cinches mean that I don't need a belt--unusual for me.
* Ties at ankles mean that the pants fit fine with my short legs.
* Ties at ankles mean that the pants don't drag while running or walking barefoot or in short-soled Vibram toe shoes.

Minuses:
* These are not formal attire, so I can't wear them wherever I want.
* If you don't have a slender waist, they will not hide it.
* Don't know yet how they will stand up to extended use.",B00022JPNE

"I was looking for a pair of pants with lots of pockets to carry gardening tools or to use when traveling.  The color brown doesn't look too military, and I was really pleased with the workmanship.

HOWEVER, my boyfriend put them on and they fit him perfectly! He looks totally hot in them and I'm very glad I bought them. He is about 6'5"" and has super long legs and these pants are definitly long enough for him.  They are great.",B00022JPNE
"These pants are excellent for civilian issue cargo pants.  The material is thick but not too heavy and the pockets are perfect.  Some reviewers have mentioned that the zipper seems weak but I haven't had any issues with them so far.  As far as sizing goes, I am usually a 32-34 and the medium works fine for me.  If your pushing a 34-36 I might get a large just in case.
Are these pants standard military issue? no, but the manufacturer never claims them to be.  If you want a decent pair of cargo pants, these are for you.  If you want USMC/Army issued BDUs, then no, you don't want these as they are very much a civilian style/cut.
I definitely will be getting more of these pants in the future!",B00022JPNE

"I ordered these in my waist size, in Russet Brown, to make up part of my steampunk outfit, but then actually tried to cancel the order because I worried they would not fit (being men's pants and I'm a woman).  I was worried they would not fit over my hips properly.  Well, no worries, they fit fine (although the zipper is cheap and took a few tries to get zipped).  They also look awesome for the outfit.  They looked a sort of caramel color online but in person they're a sort of greeny-browny color.  Nicely slouchy and Sky-Captain!  Ah yes, they are very long, but since I will be tucking them into boots I don't care.",B00022JPNE
"I do love these pants, though the problem that I'm having is that I am unproportioned in different areas. I bought the XL size, but throughout the hips, they are too big, the thighs are a little tight, and the length will need to be hemmed. Overall though, I love the pants and had to unfortunately contact the seller to see how I can order a new pair. They really are not made for short people like myself (5'4""). But considering these really small downsides, I still would recommend these pants to anyone who wants a comfortable pant.",B00022JPNE
"I was lucky to find these very well made, extremely comfortable, and also useful (all those pockets, when the price was so low.  They actually look flattering, not bulky.  With a Tee Shirt or even blouse, you can wear then for practical work jobs, or an informal night out with friends.",B00022JPNE
"I now have two pairs of these pants. They are a great buy if you like cargo. They have plenty of pockets and are probably the most durable pants you'll ever get.

It seems some people have trouble with the sizing. Here is something to keep in mind:
I am 6'2"", and my actual waist size is between 30-32"" (I almost always go with 32"" pants). A ""Medium"" size of these fit me fine as long as I adjust the ties on the sides to make the waist as small as it goes. They are also a bit longer than your average pants (which is something I personally like), but the legs of the pants (even without being tied) are slim enough to never get caught under my shoes.",B00022JPNE
"Excellent quality at an unbelievable price! Most cargo pants I found were at least $50. Very comfortable and lots of pockets. These were too big, but fit my husband perfectly! Would highly recommend!",B00022JPNE
Its a tough but soft texture. The fit is some what baggie style but not loose. This is genuine militairy fatigues.,B00022JPNE
"These cargoes fit well.  I had to have the ankle ties replaced with elastic, as they were always coming loose.  The zipper is cheap and sticks.  I had to have that replaced as well.",B00022JPNE
"While they bring up some valid CONCERNS, the concerns are left without any ground to stand on. The pants come with adjustable waist tabs, so they'll fit you if you get within the right range. I usually go for a size 36 waist on pants, and these fit me perfectly without ANY adjustments whatsoever. They're comfortable and functional, and they look good too.

Only complaint is that the thigh-high pockets are sewn shut on the sides. Oh well, The others all work fine.

Highly recommend these.",B00022JPNE
"Its a good pair of pants, but I accidentally got the wrong size. So motive to lose weight.",B00022JPNE
"I bought these from my boyfriend's wish list, and they are great!  So soft, but the material isn't thin (seems very durable).  I am poking around too see if they carry women's sizes.",B00022JPNE
"These pants are great, they wash nicely and fit to size. Not too much to iron as well. A nice compliment to the wardrobe.",B00022JPNE
"Way too big. Couldn't find a smaller size and thought these would be okay but they are not. I will not send them back because it's too much effort but i will need to have them taken in quite a bit. :( disappointed.

If you are small you might want to try the junior boys section if they have one.",B00022JPNE
the pants is new but it is old stock as you can see it been kept for a few years,B00022JPNE
"What can I say, fit perfect to me, the textile feels good and has a nice cut . I got three pairs, different colours and I wear them every day . Nevertheless the price is a bargain !
Thank you guys !",B00022JPNE
i really love this pair of pants that i purchase the only problem i had was the length of these pants was a little too long so i had them shorten,B00022JPNE
These pants are awesome. I use them day to day and they hold up very well.,B00022JPNE
"Brilliant, durable, functional and yet fashionable! Great for workwear or just casual trousers. I bought these for my holiday to Hungary and they were great if a bit too warm.
Recommended.",B00022JPNE
"I ordered a size smaller than usual since everyone was saying they're too loose, but these are too tight on me!  Guess I over-compensated.  Oh well.  Nice looking pants though.",B00022JPNE
"I bought them to wear when playing Airsoft. They're comfortable, fairly lightweight, and are well made.",B00022JPNE
"These pants are comfortable, well made, and extremely tough.  I bought one pair to start, olive drab XL.  I have a 37"" waist (like most dudes, I wasn't  totally sure, so I actually measured), and though these pants are more like a 40"" or 42"" in that size, the side-straps adjust the waistband perfectly.  They fit great, look good with any belt (if you wear a belt, which I do), and having eight pockets (side, butt, lower-thigh, and mid-calf) is a great feature.

A lot of folks complain that the legs are too long.  Well, that's kind of the point - see those ties on the bottom of the legs?  I have size 13 Wide feet, and I often buy shoes a tad large to accommodate these 'boats' I walk around on.  Just follow along here . . .  Walking in shoes that are a little too big will pull your socks right down your legs until they're bunched at your heel.  Now, you might not have this particular problem, but seriously, isn't it annoying when your socks fall down your legs and end up bunched at your ankles?  Well guess what?  You pull those cords tight (don't worry, they're stretchy, and you won't cut off circulation or restrict movement), tie them off (double-slip works best) about an inch above your ""ankle bone"" (whatever that little knob is called), and not only will the legs of the pants NOT fall down around the heel of your shoes (to get stepped on and torn up), but your socks are held in place like magic!  Also, if you're camping, landscaping, or just generally hanging out in the wilderness, this prevents bugs and other crawlers from getting up the legs of your pants (a big deal here in NY, the deer-tick problem is always a menace).

This is called ""blousing"" the pants, and before you guys feel all girly for saying the word 'blouse', relax - they do that in the Army and Marine Corps.  Actually, in the Army Survival Manual (FM-21, can be found here on Amazon), one of the instructions for wilderness survival and hygiene is to ""blouse"" your BDU pants tightly to prevent muck and creatures from getting all over your lower half when you're out in the bush.  Remember, BDU stands for Battle Dress, Uniform - these pants are inspired and based on military field-grade wear (hence the camouflage themes).

Anyway, these pants are great for camping, fishing, hiking, mowing the lawn, ATVing, general off-roading, any kind of outdoor work (landscaping, lumberworking), and of course, paintball and other sports.  The pockets are extremely useful, and tend to slide around so when you bend your legs to lie down or crouch, you're unlikely to be lying on top of the stuff you're carrying.  The zip-fly does feel a little bit small for such tough pants, but I currently have three pairs of these BDU pants (olive, khaki, dark brown - more on the way soon) and have never had the zipper get jammed or stuck on me.  The buttons are sewn on securely, and the belt loops are wide to allow for belts of all sizes.

In short, if you like comfortable pants that are both durable and good-looking, if you like having lots of pockets for your stuff, or if you do a lot of work or play out in the yard or out in the sticks, these pants are definitely worth buying.  The price is good, the quality is good, and even though I have no experience with returning these pants (since I never would - I like them a lot, if you haven't noticed), most of the other people that left comments either had a very positive or only slightly negative experience with returns/exchanges, I would say they're worth the risk even if you've never thought of buying clothes online.  Just remember, the legs are supposed to be a little long, and the waist can be adjusted down about 6"" or 7"" with the side-straps, so you probably shouldn't worry if they're only a little big.",B00022JPNE
"hi,
i am just writing to say that this product is really awesome.thanks for the awesome srvice!!!",B00022JPNE
"I have now bought two pairs of pants like these.  The ACU looks great.  It's slightly faded for that used look.  New ACU looks horrible anyway.  If you want pants that look light real ""army pants"" or ""paratrooper pants""  but don't cost 100 dollars, this is your chance.

I have had my first pair of ultra force pants for over a year now and they still look great, work great, and have been through hell.  The only difference between these and real ACU pants is that they lack the rip-stop technology of the real pants.  However, I have never been in a combat situation where I needed the rip stop technology (Ha!).

My favorite features of the pants are the sturdy zipper (super important), the pleated pockets are sewn down to be fully functional but still look great, and the adjustable waist band.  You just give the adjusters on the left and right a tug and your pants fit perfect.

Five stars all the way.",B00022JPNE
"I love those pants, they are very soft and have a great line they look great",B00022JPNE
"I am normally a size 40-42 waist and the X-Large fit perfectly!  The legs were a little long but have ties to keep them from dragging.  These pants kept me protected and cool on my hike in the Tennessee mountains in the middle of August! (Yeah, I know I'm crazy!)",B00022JPNE
everything i ever wanted oh thank you oh lord for these bitchin pants,B00022JPNE
"Very nice they definitely run large im 5'8"" 150 lbs the smalls are still a little big.. I like them though.",B00022JPNE
Was snug for my size ... couldn't wear,B00022JPNE
"Too big!!!
But beautiful pants.
And the material is good also.
I will buy a smaller one.
I have this to my friend.",B00022JPNE
"perfect. sturdy. nice rich color. perfect fit for my 5' 10"" 220 frame. bought green also. Love them both. I also love the adjustable waist. Perfect for women",B00022JPNE
"Great pants, I would buy more if there were more colors",B00022JPNE
"really good product.  comfort, leg room and pockets are never ending.",B00022JPNE
Awesome pink camo colour.  Great for a different take on military themed fancy dress.,B00022JN04
Great price works better than I thought great quality,B00022JN04
Solid had. I engraved the front with the name of my fish & game club.,B00022JN04
Great fit and profile.  Will be buying another :-),B00022JN04
"Great cap, not problems with fit.",B00022JN04
Good quality hat for the price. fits well and has a nice shape to the brim.,B00022JN04
"This was a taller cap than I was expecting. Low Profile must mean that the bill can sets lower, because more of the head can be covered. Still a nice hat.",B00022JN04
bunches up in back when u adjust strap to fit your head,B00022JN04
"Good quality, exactly as described, ordered a second one.",B00022JN04
Fit is okay.  Heavier material not to my liking.,B00022JN04
The metal slide adjuster has been replaced by velcro adjustment straps. Well-made cap.,B00022JN04
"best classic style cap , go for this if you hate FLEX cap",B00022JN04
Definitely a quality hat velcro make a easy you're fit on my melon LOL and materials quality is well it's a heavy hat thank you Chris G PS it would nice to have some Velcro on it add some patches but still a nice hat,B00022JN04
"the size of things vary by maker, velcro is almost always a safe bet for fit, as was the case with this hat.",B00022JN04
good fit and keeps the sun out of my eyes,B00022JN04
"Love the hat,fots great, and looks good",B00022JN04
unless you have a very large head!  Fit me very nice it depend on your hat size,B00022JN04
Fit as expected. The cap was a good value for the price except the cap is unstructured which makes it rather floppy.,B00022JN04
Wife loved it and it matched her Rothco BDU Pants Pink Camo perfectly,B00022JN04
Great quality hat and does not collapse like the unstructured type.,B00022JN04
Well made but fit is a little on the small side on my adult head. good for kid/ teen size,B00022JN04
"The cheap, metal tensioning slide on the back of the hat broke within a week. I fixed it with zip ties, no joke. Other than that, it's a comfortable, great hat. I keep mine as a dedicated range hat.",B00022JN04
Great hat be looking for one like this for a while,B00022JN04
Very comfortable good looking hat.,B00022JN04
adjustable fit. nice digital design. made of quality materials. would buy again.,B00022JN04
"Love it. Would be better fitted/stretch fit, but I'm not complaining. It's hard to find a hat that I want in a low profile format.",B00022JN04
Great quality hat! I deep fit and quality made!,B00022JN04
Nice hat. Good Camo. Feels durable.,B00022JN04
Nice hat for the price but the color fades quickly if you're in the sun all summer.,B00022JN04
"l don't really like the adjustable strap /l'd prefer velcro or ""fitted'",B00022JN04
"Great hat. Fits well. Has no decow a must for me, and hard to find.",B00022JN04
The cap looks great and is adjustable to most sized.,B00022JN04
Great little Camo hat. . . and priced right.,B00022JN04
I bought this hat for myself I thought it would be a fun hat to wear i don't hunt I just like the way it looks and I like the color,B00022JN04
"Noce colors and material is soft and comfy, our son loved it! Sadly it didn't hold up well.. It tore after about a month of use. Fixed it up, noticed a tear on the other side.",B00022JN04
This is not a low profile hat - high front more like a trucker hat.  Looks silly if your head isn't the right size... returned mine.,B00022JN04
"Purchased for my husbands coworkers to be embroidered, but when they arrived we noticed that weren't deep enough from the bill to the top of the hat....So just not our style.  The print is awesome/attractive, but because of the shallow fit, we had to return the hat.",B00022JN04
"all very well, I received in Colombia in July 05",B00022JN04
"Not a low profile cap.  Decent quality, but does not fit properly.  I was looking for a cotton cap that fits the head tightly.  I will probably use this one for rainy days.",B00022JN04
Why are plain olive drab ball caps so difficult to find? This was just what we were looking for. Well-made. Well-priced.,B00022JN04
"Really good quality, have no idea what was received by other reviewers. This is well made, fits well and appears extremely durable.",B00022JN04
"Same pattern with acu, but different color",B00022JN04
"fit as perfectly ,I love it ,thanks",B00022JN04
"The Camo is slightly different than the military issue. So, if your looking to try and match it up with an outfit be warn with caution.",B00022JN04
The bottom/underside of the bill is freaking white....,B00022JN04
Great hat. I have a large head (7 3/4) with a lot of hair. This has enough space to accommodate.,B00022JN04
Nice hat with good quality materials.,B00022JN04
"Fit as expected, but not true MARPAT and faded within a month.",B00022JN04
"So far so good!  I have not had to wash it so I don't know anything about the ""turning pink"" that some have mentioned.  I like the size/shape and the camo.  I'm happy with the purchase.",B00022JN04
A LOT OF VARIANCE WITH THIS HAT- ROTHCO IS [NOT] MY CHOICE IN ANY ACU LOW PROFILE CAP!,B00022JN04
Good quality cap that is not low profile but that is to my liking. Seems to be well made for the price.,B00022JN04
It was just okay for me but I'm picky when it comes to hats.,B00022JN04
still holding up after years of wear,B00022JN04
Pretty high topped. Kind of an Elmer Fudd look. Well made though.,B00022JN04
"Simple, unobtrusive, utilitarian - a good hat for anyone who wants to keep the sun out of their eyes and not make a statement, other than ""I like practical stuff."" Best everyday head-cover I could get!",B00022JN04
"Very nice camo hat, used to make one for my college football team since we're a bunch of hippies and don't make one for ourselves.",B00022JN04
just what i wanted for my sister,B00022JN04
"My husband is a hunter and he boughht all new hunting stuff, includeing this hat he loved it and so did my son. He usually buys from Cabela's. He said the fit of this hat is so much better.",B00022JN04
Good quality hat would/will buy again,B00022JN04
It's a great hat fits good but in the sun light its pink,B00022JN04
supposed to be low profile! it is not! don't like it!,B00022JN04
"Perfect lightweight cover.  I wear a 7-1/2 MLB baseball cap, and this fits perfectly.",B00022JN04
It's a fall hat for sure. Doesn't breath,B00022JN04
It's a hat and does what it's suppose to.  I didn't go broke buying it.  I'd call that a win.,B00022JN04
"Cool hat, great price. I don't really understand the ""How does this product fit"" question - the thing is adjustable. Whatever.",B00022JN04
"Hat is well-made and the color is true to spec and as such, I gave it 3 starts. However, this is NOT a low-profile cap and is actually quite tall on one's head. They could EASILY cut off about 1-2"" of the sides and then, maybe it would be a true ""low-profile"" cap.",B00022JN04
This hat went great with my wife's costume...great fit as well!,B00022JN04
Quality is good and price reasonable. Came in fast and I will definitely get more...,B00022JN04
"I don't hunt.  My husband hunts.  But when I hit the casino and I'm dressed in black and pink, this hat gets lots of positive comments and also covers up my messy casino hair.",B00022JN04
I like the first hat I bought so I bought this one.,B00022JN04
My favorite hat right now and i'm not even smoking extremist Iranians,B00022JN04
Grandson just loves the digital military design. Well made and great product!,B00022JN04
Quality and color are nice on this cap but it is not low profile as described.  Now that I look at the product photo it is accurate and doesn't look low profile.  It will get worn but never will it be a favorite for this reason.  The adjusting strap works well and tucks away excess inside the cap headband.,B00022JN04
"i love the color and the material , this was a great deal",B00022JN04
My husband has ordered this cap before and loves it.,B00022JN04
This is a ok hat but it was poorly made. You get what you pay for.,B00022JN04
"Great, am satisfied with the deal",B00022JN04
"Love it. It matches the pants, shorts and shirt I also ordered.",B00022JN04
Decent cap for the price.  Fits normally and as expected.  Color is as it should be.,B00022JN04
"Cap was thicker than I expected, but that was a good thing.",B00022JN04
Great cap. Love the low profile and sliding buckle closure. Belonged to my husband but is mine now.,B00022JN04
Excellent turnaround. I gave 4 star on the hat because it is somewhat on the small side.,B00022JN04
Amazing hat.  My sister absolutely loves it!,B00022JN04
"Fits just fine, looks good, seems well-made.",B00022JN04
Excellent cap. Rothco makes the best baseball caps!,B00022JN04
Love this hat. Very comfortable and looks great.,B00022JN04
I wasn't sure if a hat this cheap would be any good but this is a nice cap. I bought it for my niece's son and he promised not to lose it and so far he hasn't so I guess he must like it.,B00022JN04
"If you want a pink camouflage hat, this is the one for you.",B00022JN04
"Perfect. Love the low profile look, it's a good quality durable hat.",B00022JN04
The bill is slightly longer than I expected but love it nonetheless,B00022JN04
Very attractive digital camo pattern. Light weight. I've used it a lot,B00022JN04
It fit great just wasn't the right color,B00022JN04
"nice hat , could have used a thicker material , but will do for now.",B00022JN04
"Cool hat and cool design. I really like the digital camo look. Hat fit a little too small on me, but overall a cool hat to wear shooting",B00022JN04
"It's not 100% comfortable but i understand it's hard to make a cap for every specific head without use other model with author's right. So, it fit as expected and it have a nice printed color",B00022JN04
This hat is a really nice 4 season hat.,B00022JN04
"My husband wears size 7 3/4 and it is a snug fit for now until he stretches it out a bit with normal wear. The cap seems to be made of quality material and is very durable, not to mention we love the design and color. Not low profile as described.",B00022JN04
"Great camo cap, good quality! Doesn't look cheap! Perfect for hunting season",B00022JN04
Exactly as shown. Looks terrific!,B00022JN04
I ordered this hat since i was a Marine at one point and always liked the way are Marpat looked. What attracted me initially to this hat was because it states right in the name its a low profile cap. This hat is about as low profile as a hard hat. The hat will actually hit my ears before the top of my head thats how low profile this thing is. So if you are expecting low profile like the description..... don't buy.,B00022JN04
"Not much to say. It's a hat. It's good material, camo is good quality as well. I prefer flexfit hats but they don't make a multi cam that I've found so this is the next best thing. Works and fits like a hat should.",B00022JN04
"Great hat to add to my collection. Fits and feels great, pattern/color matches my ecwcs level6 GoreTex suit like it should.  Better quality than expected, but you can never rule out a Rothco product. Every rothco item I have purchased has met or exceeded my expectations.",B00022JN04
It's just as I expected . The fit is perfect . Looking to get another in a different pattern .,B00022JN04
Low profile not that low but nice,B00022JN04
Didn't fit... Looks nice though.,B00022JN04
this hat is super comfortable to wear. I would recommend this hat to anyone.,B00022JN04
This cap is adjustable so it fits well. The main part of the hat is shallow so it fits close to the head and keeps the cold out.,B00022JN04
Perfect cap for me. I was looking for a good basic comfortable cap and this one was exactly what I wanted.,B00022JN04
"Great hat. I wear it every day. Fits nice, very comfortable. Highly recommended.",B00022JN04
"Great quality! But the discription says ""low profile""... it is not low profile. Its like a billboard on top of my head. I'll wear it hunting, but that's all. I just hope the wind doesnt blow me over hile wearing it... The four stars are all for quality. I should probably rate it a 2 or 3 because of the discription being wrong.",B00022JN04
Really a nice cap seems well made.,B00022JN04
"Looks great, fits great and is surprisingly soft.",B00022JN04
"This has a higher profile than indicated,  not a low one at all. I almost returned it, but it seems to have good quality material and I like the color.",B00022JN04
fitttt like you want adjust. i hope they can made one with WaterProof,B00022JN04
"This was a gift for my father and he loves it, and the material looks really good.",B00022JN04
"Well built hat, fits nicely.  I wore it a lot for a while at work and got it all sweaty.  I hand washed it in hot soapy water and let it dry and it still retained it's shape without any problems.  The bill is kind of long but, not really an issue.  Goes well with the digi-camo pants.",B00022JN04
Great hat. I recommend this product.,B00022JN04
These are adjustable so a perfect fit no matter what.  The quality seems very good too.,B00022JN04
It's a cap for Pete's sake..... Need a cap?  Then buy one.,B00022JN04
"Sorry....I gotta be honest here....I'll never wear this POS!
The brim appears to be about a foot long, lol...........VERY flimsy, VERY thin,
VERY poorly constructed by 8 year old Chinese girls in a sweat shop!
Don't waste your money on this........oh.......
I'm only basing my opinion from years in the U.S. ARMY!",B00022JN04
It's a hat not much more to say,B00022JN04
"It's a good hat, but it fits just a bit small.",B00022JN04
nice cap....I sweetheart loves what his money bought.,B00022JN04
I would definitely purchase this item again.,B00022JN04
"First of all, it's kind of small. Not tiny, but definitely not generously sized to mil specs. Second, well, the quality is garbage. This hat is fading with too much pink color just after one wash. That's using a cold water cycle wash, too. If you think the digital camo look with slight pink tone is cool, think again... Another low quality knock off from Rothco. What a waste of money!",B00022JN04
Looks like a great hat. Camo is good. It was the size of the bill on the hat. It was huge!!!!!,B00022JN04
"I am a fan of digital camo patterns, and I am a fan of ball caps.  This brings two of my favorite things together.  I need a hat for those cool mornings and when the snow starts to fall later in the season to keep my head warm and dry.  As well as shield my glasses from rain or snow.  Hat is stoutly constructed and adjustable to fit. I like it for the warmth if provides on cooler mornings works great for that purpose.  It is a ball cap so your ears are exposed.  The top of my head is protected. It can be a little too warm on my head in sunny weather, but I just take it off.  Hat survived heavey rain on it and did not loose it's appeal/structure or appearance to my eyes. Great hat.",B00022JN04
Great camo hat that I got for all of the girls in my house.,B00022JN04
Great hat! Loved my other one and lost it.  Thank you amazon for carrying it at a fair price!!! Fit is just perfect for me.,B00022JN04
This hat is well made and the price isn't bad either.  This material has a very soft quality to it and it feels so good to the touch. The fit is great it is adjustable and it has a good shape all ready.,B00022JN04
"Nice hat, good price. Light weight and very comfort able and made with quality materials. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an everyday hat.",B00022JN04
I wore it a lot but it sun faded after a while and doesn't blend in anymore. I mean I suppose that was my fault but the other hats I wear more than that one are perfectly fine,B00022JN04
Good hat it matched all my gear its what I expected and keeps the sun out of my eyes during early season,B00022JN04
"I love how this hat fits. There are no pressure points and the way the bill sits is perfect for playing softball/baseball. The only thing I'd like to comment on is that this cap holds heat. When it's hot/warm and humid, be prepared to have a sweaty head. But on cool nights it's nice to have.

Overall, a great hat.",B00022JN04
I bought this hat to match my rothco woodland digital pants and it matched perfect. Fits great!,B00022JN04
I ordered a bit big and he has time to grow into it.  He loves it and can barely wait for Halloween to wear it (made him promise he wouldn't wear it before then) and he will also be wearing to career day at school.,B00022JN04
Nice warm hat.  Adjustable strap.  The snap even stays snapped when you need it to.,B00022JN04
"I love this hat!  It fits great and is easy to adjust.  I've had this hat for 9 months and put it through some rough places, and it's still looking good.",B00022JN04
"The good is that I really liked the color.

I am not sure what it is about hats/caps but I have a challenging time finding one that fits.  I am not s small person as I am 6' 4"" tall 216 pounds, sometimes more pounds but different story.  There is no way this cap could even be close to low profile.  If you are Hoss from the old Bonanza show or want a ten gallon cap then this is the one for you!  If you want an actually low profile cap then might want to keep shopping.

I returned the cap with no fuss.",B00022JN04
It's very comfortable. Adjusts easy and stays adjusted.,B00022JN04
"Nice enough for the money, fits and i like the camo pattern. However, I wouldn't call it low profile and the material is like flannel, kind of fuzzy. Also, like the pants and shirt from rothco, the pattern and/or the colors don't quite match. Close, but not the same!",B00022JN04
"Very cool, looks sharp, fits well.  I cover up all the time, and think this one will hold up well!  Very happy with this since the dude left the box on the porch, just two days after I clicked on it. Not a single gripe or ounce of let-down.",B00022JN04
"First Impressions: Clean, Nice looking, Good Price

The Good: The Bill is a bit longer than I would have liked, but bearable

The Bad: It wasn't free

Would I purchase this item again: Yes",B00022JN04
"I very much like this hat. The material is nice and of quality, the bill feels solid and not made of cardboard so hopefully it'll hold well when wet. The adjustable strap is my only minor gripe. When you adjust the size the excess is supposed to slip inside the hat but sometimes its quite difficult to get it in there. Minor gripe I agree. Overall however, I would certainly purchase again.",B00022JN04
"Love the hat, a bit larger then I expected for a womens hat but its very cool",B00022JN04
"This is my 3rd ACU camo cap. I wear them to work, & they get dirty. After several washes (20+), I get a new replacement. Excellent product.",B00022JN04
"This ""baseball"" hat, with the ""digital"" desert design will go beautifully with my tee shirt, of the same pattern and will provide a nice alternative to my ""patrol"" cap I recently bought in the same digital design.  Rothco makes quality products, and I've always had good luck with them, and have several different types of clothing from them.  I'd also recommend any clothing from Propper, Tru-Spec,, Mil-Spec. Basically any of the providers supplying clothing to our armed forces.  Though I have never served (due to physical limitations) I respect those who have and wear this out of respect to them.  You'll like them.",B00022JN04
"Exactly as advertised. Looks great, light weight, and at this price I ordered a second one the next day. Been receiving compliments
on the cap everyday. Good quality and arrived at my door quickly as promised.",B00022JN04
"Even though this hat is somewhat large I still love it. It covers my ears and wasn't sure it was made for a girls head. I have the adjustable band in the back as tight as it can go and it still feels a little big. No matter, I rock it and am happy that I finally bought it.",B00022JN04
"This was my 2nd order for this type of cap. the original had a velcro adjustment band in the back. They now have a metal buckle which really sucks. and the inside of the new style is snow white, which defeats the camo effect completely.  What happened?",B00022JN04
"Terrific hat. Favorite of all. Wear daily. Very comfortable with the perfect ""not too big not to nothing crown"" look. Great for working or playing in the sun to protect face as I had been diagnosed with skin cancer in my nose. Bummer, but now protect myself with this great hat from Rothco. Highly recommended! Thx",B00022JN04
"I really like my new Camo hat. It's handsome,very light weight and comfortable.",B00022JN04
I have a large head and it is difficult to find a cap that fits. This cap fits beautifully. The adjustment strap doesn't have a problem with moving around like other caps do. I hate having to comb my hair so i wear this in public instead.,B00022JN04
The hat ran too small for me or my son.  Had to return it.,B00022JN04
"I like wearing ballcaps outdoors camping, cycling, often on backwards while
jogging or hanging out.  I like the masculine camo look.  This cap arrived
ontime and in great condition - I did have to adjust the strap a lot, and I'm
pretty certain it's more on the small size compared with my other baseball caps.",B00022JN04
"This hat fits well, looks good, and is a soft comfortable material. I like the hat and have gotten compliments while wearing it. If you are looking for a Digital Camo hat, this is the one you want.",B00022JN04
"Hubby really likes this cap. It doesn't have the hard piece in front,so its soft. Healso likes that it does not size with the metal sizer.",B00022JN04
"I love the color, but the top part is so huge and tall. It looks silly. The color is nice though.",B00022JN04
"Like the hat, goes w/ all my digital camo clothes I got. Of course u never wear them all at the same time lol. But good product, nice price. Bought two of them. Worth it :)",B00022JN04
"why can't I just click the stars?  It's a hat, it's a little too small, what else is there to say?  Seriously, if you want a review, let me just click the stars and move on.",B00022JN04
this hat has very good quality and it arrived with out being smashed and it looks good too. I would order one again.,B00022JN04
I bought the same hat a year ago and loved it. It was the nicest hat I have ever worn. The original was a quality hat and I actually got compliments on it. They have changed the design and it is a cheap piece of crap now. It use to have a nice velcro strap on the back but it has been replaced with a bulky and ugly metal buckle. I am going to get a hair cut tommorow so I won't need to wear this piece of junk.,B00022JN04
"I was looking for a ball cap in camo for hunting, and this one stood out to me because it looked like it would be comfortable.  I've worn it out several times, and it is indeed comfy.  The size adjustment is easy to do, but at the same time it holds the size you set it at.  I'm not sure how the hat would react to hot weather wear; I didn't buy it for that and the weather hasn't been warm enough to test.  The pattern is clear and the colors true.  I gave this four stars because it wasn't a fitted cap.  Otherwise, it's a great choice.",B00022JN04
I was surprised its high quality. I can say this cap is the best value for money. I love it. Thanks a lot.,B00022JN04
"The color is great, the fit is good. I don't like structured hats & bought these to embroider for my company. The guys that like structured hats love them. High quality hat.",B00022JN04
I love this hat. Low profile with no structure built in. I have bought many of these and will buy more. They are great for embroidery of your company logo.,B00022JN04
Good quality hat. Pretty much what I've come to expect from rothco. Especially good for the price. Would buy again,B00022JN04
As stated in my above comment. This is also a good quality product. My son was very happy with his purchase. Would order from them again.,B00022JN04
This low-profile baseball cap is a great piece of kit for a low price.  I purchased the Coyote Brown color and am very pleased with it.  The hat is adjustable and uses a metal d-ring to adjust the diameter of the hat (rather than noisy velcro).  And it was less than $10.,B00022JN04
"cap is kinda small, but nice.  like color and design. too much hair to fit well.  will recommend to others",B00022JN04
"I know its just a hat, but what is even better is that it matches all my other digital woodland camo gear. Would keep buying them if i needed to. Well constructed and can take a beating.",B00022JN04
"Wow for this price, if I held it in my hand I would have paid $20 easily. Very legit and feels like the professional military, it's thick and I'm really happy.",B00022JN04
if you like camo and you like hats....there ya go. aint gotta worry bout if it matches what your wearing cause camo goes with everything.,B00022JN04
"This is a good hat, Well made & looks good/ proportionate, The front panel has an inner support to keep the front standing up good, the material is good but I don't think this is a low profile hat. I kept it anyway becouse it is well made & good material, It has a metal adjuster in the back for size, The hat will pull down to my ears with room to spare.

I would also buy this in Black if I seen this exact one for sale.

The inner tag says Rothco, One size fits all (Adjustable) 100% Cotton, Made in China.

I would recommend this unless you are hell bent on a ""Low Profile"" .",B00022JN04
Couldn't ask for more...Now I can consider a member of the Duck Dynasty Clan and fit in with my Red Neck Neighbor...Smile!!!,B00022JN04
If your like me  and like a short bill cap so you don't look like a duck then don't buy. Waste of money. Save your money and buy from a rack.,B00022JN04
"Just what I wanted , good quality and looks great on. Fits a little big in size so would look a bit weird if you have a small head",B00022JN04
"This hat is very good quality.  I like the way it adjusts, it is not just a plastic tab.  The color is awesome.",B00022JN04
Very nice hat.  Arrived quickly.  I am very satisfied with my puchase.  Using it for a Mardi Gras ball and dance since all my hair is gone from cancer treatment.,B00022JN04
If you're going to make a LOW PROFILE cap then don't reenforce the front of the cap and the wearer won't look like Elmer Fudd,B00022JN04
AWSOME camo. Perfectly matches their digital camo combat shirt. Heavy duty stitching. Really thick fabric and the bill is really sturdy too,B00022JN04
"This hat is made very well, a great buy for under $10, better than I expected. I highly recommend it!",B00022JN04
"The cap is good quality, made by Rothco. It seems a little larger than a low profile cap, that's my honest opinion, but it fits well and looks good. The peak is stiff and holds its shape well. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase",B00022JN04
"I purchased it for a halloween costume, but will definitely wear it again come camping season!  Can't wait till Spring!",B00022JN04
"Again, great price (had considered purchasing for a while, but included as add on)
Had a buckle closure (don't remember if this was included in prod. description), which I normally shy away from, but it really goes unnoticed and is fairly comfortable.
I haven't really worn it much yet, but when I first tried it on it felt great.",B00022JN04
Its a hat...... its camo..... I seem to be able to wear it on my head...... this seems to be consistent with what was advertised,B00022JN04
"So Far I Love This Cap and how it is make. I got this just befor the holidays and so I haven't wore it to much ,but sofar its great.",B00022JN04
"No logos, fits on my head, and doesn't make me look like a geek like most other hats. Oh and yes, I'm from the South in case you were assuming...you got that right",B00022JN04
The quality of material and workmanship in this hat are far superior to the eight bucks I paid for it. Get you one!,B00022JN04
just perfect i like so much it soft very smooth and it takes me i like it the peck is the best part though,B00022JN04
"Goes on my head, so much better than the paper bag that i have been using. Highly recommended. get one today !",B00022JN04
"Great deal for the price. Perfect fit, digital camo design. Bought three of these caps for myself, son-in-law and grandson.",B00022JN04
"This is a very nice hat and it is very high quality, especially for the price. However please be aware if you are trying to match this with MARPAT it is not quite the same. Worn by its self it's pretty close, and gets the idea across, but when it's worn together with real MARPAT it looks noticeably different. Overall I still really like it though and wear it all the time.",B00022JN04
I love the quality of this unit.  The camo pattern was so intense that I almost disappeared while looking in the mirror!,B00022JN04
"Great cap, sits tight and low on your head so you don't look like Justin Bieber... Wore it for Halloween with a grey camo outfit (also from Amazon) and knee high boots, and it was a super cute outfit (and sexy without showing ANY skin...). My new favorite hat!",B00022JN04
This hat is exactly the pattern I have wanted and it fits well.  I love it and wear it all the time!,B00022JN04
"I got it for her birthday. It look very nice, and she liked it despite not being a ball cap person.",B00022JN04
I was looking for the color and shape of this hat. It is good quality and great on price. I will be buying 3 more.,B00022JN04
Found this digital camo hat cause I want to honor my brother in law who's currently serving in the Army. I also pin his rank to the hat and I wear it everyday now in his honor. It's comfortable and now my favorite hat in my collection.,B00022JN04
He totally loves this hat. He wears it all the time it matches all his other camo stuff. He looks really cute in it to and it fits him nicely.,B00022JN04
I wear a smaller hat size and this fits me fine. It seems to be fairly well constructed and it is very comfortable to wear.  As far as the camouflage goes it looks good.  How well it works compared to other types well that is up to your personal opinion. I think it probably works better because if you look into the woods it is detail that stands out and some cammo actually looks like leaves and trees without the 3d aspect to it.  My opinion is blobs of pastel colors is better and not showing a profile rather than wearing a walking picture of the woods.  This hat is not too heavy so wearing it when it is warm is not a problem. I would not hesitate to suggest that someone else should buy it.,B00022JN04
"NIce, simple hat that has an adjustable strap in the back.  I've messed mine up a few times, but it holds up well in the wash.  (Air dry it.)",B00022JN04
"Bought the hat for a Halloween costume (dressed as an army soldier, in full camo).  The hat is comfortable and good quality.  I would recommend.",B00022JN04
great hat just don't wash in hot water. they shrink. i bought 5 and wear them at work. they fit great and hold up very well.,B00022JN04
"This had is very well made and stitched wonderfully , I can tell that its going to last for sometime. It comes with a adjustable cloth strap in the back , so one size fits all ....",B00022JN04
"Great cap for hunting camo. The pattern is neat and blends in well. The hat is cotton and breathes well, just a little thick and warm for my liking, will be better used in the fall.",B00022JN04
Very comfortable hat at a great price. Nice digital pattern. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice cammo hat.,B00022JN04
"This is a very comfortable cap. The fabric is light, allowing good airflow. There's no stiff backing on the inside so it gives the cap a lower profile, which I like. The camo design and colors are very nice. I highly recommend it.",B00022JN04
"It fits exactly the way I like a hat.  For the money, you can't beat it.  If only others used the same manufacturing",B00022JN04
The quality is good and it arrived on time but the hat is much darker than pictured. I wanted something lighter but the hat is almost neon pink.,B00022JN04
I love this cap.  It's one of the few that look good on me.  It arrived in pretty good time.  It fits well and I really like it!,B00022JN04
The cover feels to be good quality and fits well however the way the cover was designed to be adjustable was not the best,B00022JN04
"Great hat, very light weight. Was exactly what I was wanting. Digital pattern looks great, very cool. Would buy one again when this one wears out.",B00022JN04
The tan color in this hat is a bit darker than expected but it looks great.  Solid feel for being all cotton and keeps its shape.,B00022JN04
"Fits great on my husband's head, it's durable and sturdy without being cumbersome, camo print is not to overbearing. Thanks",B00022JN04
"Dog ate last one, HAD to replace it. Try them, the ""low profile"" you'll love them. More of a winter hat but. It's o.k., it won't rust or anything!",B00022JN04
This is very nice hat. Soft material and nice buckle on the back. I have a large head and it fits me well.,B00022JN04
"Great hat. It fits my head well, the material is nice, and the color is good with no fading yet.",B00022JN04
"I gave this a 5 because there is nothing wrong with the hat, but it is very SMALL for a child or petite woman!
Too too small for an adult male.",B00022JN04
"I bought this for a friend and they just love it. Talked about how they cant wait to use it at the lake and such. I thought it was a little cheesy, but I'm not much of a camo person. Apparently if you like camo and pink, this is the bees knees.",B00022JN04
the hat came smashed . Not cool hats are made to be perfect shaped. I wished it would be perfect,B00022JN04
"its a hat, size youth extra large, it fits my head.

cheap hat that fits my head and is camo as ordered. great, thanks 5 stars.",B00022JN04
Fit great...great price! It also matched perfectly with a pair of pink camo pants I bought a few weeks ago!,B00022JN04
Good. Wish the bill was a little stiffer. It is easy to adjust and looks great. Comfortable to wear even with my glasses,B00022JN04
I like these hats. The bill seems to be made of plastic so it won't seperate like paper fiber bills. The bill is pre-formed too!,B00022JN04
"I love this hat. It looks and fits great, plus it matches my olive drab work uniform perfectly. Would buy it again.",B00022JN04
good quality and well made item. I would prefer a fitted cap but it is not available in this Camo style.,B00022JN04
"Bought it for my Dad. He is a retired Army officer.
He loved it.
Its exactly how it looks in here.",B00022JN04
fits very well. sits very well. the material is of good quality and has held up so far in rain and snow.,B00022JN04
Great fit and very comfortable.  Print matches everything else Rothco puts out in Woodland Digi Marpat.  Only wish it had velcro patch placement on front and back.  Otherwise great hat!,B00022JN04
Fits well and looks ok. Not the best hat I have but a good one at any rate. Worth the price.,B00022JN04
"Loved the hat, it was adorable and fit like a glove! Wore it to the breast cancer race and got lots of compliments!",B00022JN04
"This hat is a great value for a digital camo hat in the ACU pattern.  Unlike some others cheaper hats I have seen, the colors are correct and do not have that ""pinkish tinge.""  It does not have the inner structure in the front though, but it rigid enough not to fit like a ""slouch hat"".  I have had it for 2 months now and wear it frequently.",B00022JN04
"As ordered,quality product,reasonable price. Great idea for the hunter in the family, or just to wear working in the yard. Great gift idea,but I bought it for hunting.",B00022JN04
"I received the cap quickly and it was exactly as advertised. Loved the colors, went well with my pink camo pants.",B00022JN04
"Color matches my other Army digital stuff.  Seems to be decent construction so far.  It doesn't have the stiff front found in your standard baseball hat, so it forms to the head nicely.",B00022JN04
The army baseball cap looks special especially the color and texture of the resemblance of the US armed forces. Adjustable on the size so that different head sizes can wear. It will suit best men with clean cut hair style like in the army.,B00022JN04
"This hat fit perfect. The the digital woodland camo colors are deep and colorful.
The hat is also thick, warm and very well made. For the price you cant beat it. Im a big
fan of Rothco products, and have bought quite a few of them, they have not let me down yet.",B00022JN04
"It feels good, and fits my big nogger very well. I'd recommend just about any rothco product to anyone. The lopro cap has more green than i care for, but i'm in FL to being green it's great, otherwise when i move you to IL my opinion may change.",B00022JN04
I was looking for a cap with an adjustable back. Material is nice. Looks just like photos. Incredible value. A nice way to get a cam cap without paying extra to advertise for someone.,B00022JN04
"I bought this to match the digital woodland shirt I bought and they match exact! That is usually a hard one to come by, usually one is lighter than the other or the pattern is off a little. I love the material it is made of and rides just right on my head like I want. Didn't go wrong there.",B00022JN04
"This hat is a complete Cop Out when it comes to quality and craftsmanship. Did I say Craftsmanship? Yeah right.. Not complaining, just being real.. Buy a CHEAP hat, get a CHEAP hat....................",B00022JN04
Got this for 13 year old daughter for Christmas... she LOVES it!  Can't go wrong with Pink Camo. Fits nice and good quality.,B00022JN04
"Well made hat for the price, decent quality.  Good product so far.  Will see how it holds up, seems like it will last a good while.",B00022JN04
"I like this hat, and the price was right. It is sturdy. It seems well made and is comfortable. The pattern is correct and matches my other Mar-pat stuff perfectly.",B00022JN04
"I remember wearing this hat for a few days, but I lost it. I can recall that it was good quality, and I enjoyed wearing it with my ACUs for good camoflauge. This cap would go great for paintball/airsoft. Just throw that hat in reverse and put down your mask for extra support.",B00022JN04
"Its an ok hat, but while most hats have a firm front to it (usually where a label goes like a normal baseball hat) this hat doesnt have it, so its pretty flimsy.",B00022JN04
"The color is closer salmon or to put it differently - PINK!  Yeah, the color is a bit off.  Thankfully, my wife loves it and she took it!",B00022JN04
"This hat is good quality and represented well by the photo.  The thing I don't understand is why they call it a ""supreme low profile cap"" because it is a full sized baseball cap.  There is nothing low profile about its construction, but maybe you could keep a low profile by blending into the trees.  ;]",B00022JN04
Purchased this hat and it arrived ahead of schedule.  The cap is a good quality product that fits well and looks good.,B00022JN04
"its sturty, easy to adjust, good camo. seems like a hat to me , a good one but not much to say about it...",B00022JN04
"this was awesome
arrived pretty quick and was really sturdy and built good
the bak is out thoug so its not solid",B00022JN04
good hat for a good price. Alto of digital camo is off color from the army's combat uniform. This hat matches my uniform and is very comfortable. I'm very happy with it.,B00022JN04
Very nice quality cap.  Heavy weight construction.  Takes a bit of breaking in. Color is perfect shade of OD.,B00022JN04
The best ball caps around. Can't beat the quality and fitment. I've tried.,B00022JN04
"Thick material, structured crown, as pictured.",B00022JN04
This cap was better than what I thought it would be. Great material. And I loved the firmness of the cap.,B00022JN04
Just order another for a friend...,B00022JN04
It same to me...and very good...,B0002321Y8
"too tight in the bust, too loose in the bottom",B0002321Y8
Works great for my wedding dress! It's nice and structured without being too tight where you can't breath. The only problem was that it showed lines through the dress and I had to use something over that to smooth it over. It arrived right on time!,B0002321Y8
"This product is not only very comfortable and made from great material, but it tucks you in and perks you up in all of the right spots. I would recommend this for Christmas parties, weddings, and proms. I just used it for my bridal portraits and it didn't bother me or get in my way one bit. Also, very easy to clean.",B0002321Y8
Knee ripped within the first week. Comfortable but not durable.,B000234VKA
"Fits great. Looks good. I've been putting them to heavy use since purchasing, and they are holding up well.",B000234VKA
"I've bought several pairs of Rothco's ""paratrooper"" style cargo pants, and absolutely love them. I wanted a navy blue pair, so I ordered these thinking they would be similar.

The material seems durable enough, but stiff, even compared to ABU's. I also didn't notice from the description that these have a button fly. One or the other would've been okay, but I chose to return them and just order another pair of the paratroopers.",B000234VKA
still don't like the buttons on the fly,B000234VKA
My husband is a police officer and wears these BDU pants everyday for work.  These pants are made extremely well.  They wash very well and last a VERY long time.  Definitely worth the money.  I will be buying these again in the future.,B000234VKA
"I am very hard on clothes due to my job, and these pants are nearly indestructible! They are very comfy as well. The weatherprood coating works nicely and will keep you dry as long as your boots and top are also weatherproof. I did break off a button for the fly by getting caught as I was squeezing into a tight area, but the fabric is so tough it allowed me to pull the thread and just sew on a new one without any problems.",B000234VKA
"Great quality nice pants, fit well. Just remember when purchasing these these are the ones with the button fly not the zipper.",B000234VKA
This pants were okay but I did not know the zipper were buttons If the zippers would have been in the zipper it would have been a lot better,B000234VKA
was as described fit was also good.,B000234VKA
This is my sixths pair i like them they last long I wish they came in nomex fiber buttons fall off frequently but they are easy to put back on.,B000234VKA
Good quality fabric but I was hoping that I was able to pick a length. All in all I am satisfied.,B000234VKA
Excellent quality. good fit using chart.,B000234VKA
I am a former Marine and this does not seem like the quality that I am used to. The seem at the bottom is starting to come undone just after one wash.,B000237CD8
The quality is very good. It had a cottony stretchy feel. My husband wore it for his boxing match and it looked awesome!,B000237CD8
The sizing was accurate. The quality excellent. Washes and wears well. We have ordered other tshirts from Rothco. It's a great value.,B000237CD8
"Order one size larger than you think you need. But you get what you pay for. For what you pay, its not a bad deal.",B000237CCE
"I don't see how this got USMC approved. I have tees that are over 10 years old, washed many times and still have better fabric thickness than this. I can see my hand through it!  Not worth the postage to return.  Semper Fi",B000237CCE
the shoulders are a really weird fit and it runs small...basically the only thing i liked about it is that it said marines on it lol oorah,B000237CCE
"Our son  loved it - wore it while opening other gifts.  Nice & firm material, very nicely made.  He'a a big Marine fan",B000237CCE
I bought this shirt for my fianc he fell in love with it he says he love the way the shirt looks feels n looks on him couldn't of been more happier with this purchase :),B000237CCE
i was not happy with this purchase.  the item has an odd cut/shape to it..wouldn't buy again. ended up giving it to my girlfriend,B000237CCE
"I wear an XL when it comes to T-Shirts.  I never had a problem with one being too small until this shirt.  It was a little tight around the pits.  If it concerns you, you may want to jump up a size.",B000237CCE

My go to inside work out shirt for using the Nordic Trak and the Step.,B000237CCE

"Too big so I ordered a small also. Use one for workouts and the other to show off the ""guns"".",B000237CCE
It's a tank top.  It goes under other clothes or by itself for summer or gym. I ordered a xxl because that's the size I wear in a normal t-shirt.  Xxl is just a little too small.  It's still a nice tank top so I gave it to my wife.,B000237CCE
The quality is very good. It had a cottony stretchy feel. My husband wore it for his boxing match and it looked awesome!,B000237CCE
Hoooo-raaah !!!  Once a marine always a marine......... I enjoy the sleeveless shirts anyway. Especially  within  the  warmer climates I travel to.,B000237CCE

The sizing was accurate. The quality excellent. Washes and wears well. We have ordered other tshirts from Rothco. It's a great value.,B000237CCE
love this tank. very soft n comfortable. fits great and looks great seems to be great quality and I got it fast with no problems.only wish they had others and different colors,B000237CCE
Great quality. It was a father's day gift that my marine Corp father absolutely loves. Than k you for it help.,B000237CCE
"It's a good fitting tank top, it's very light when wearing it.
My friends were asking why would u get a marines tank top, my answer is why not :)
I've got one size bigger than i normally would wear and its great.",B000237CCE
"The shirt itself is fine,but the sizing is not what I expected.  I ordered an XL because of reviews that said the shirt runs small, and to order one size up.  Also, 77% of people said the fit is as to be expected.  So I ordered the XL, and it's a good bit too big.  Now it will cost about half the price of the shirt to return it.  Maybe it will shrink a little when I wear it.  Oh well.",B000237CCE
I am a former Marine and this does not seem like the quality that I am used to. The seem at the bottom is starting to come undone just after one wash.,B000237CCE
comfortable tank top-fits as expected!,B000237CCE
"Arrived just as expected. Fits a little smaller, so buy a size bigger then normal",B000237CCE
Just what I wanted! Anyone in or joining marine corps needs this! Great for lounge wear or athletic activities.... Love it and would recommend. I got a large and it fits perfectly,B000237CCE
Ordered it for my husband as he was in the army for the Army birthday.  He is very happy with it.  Fits perfect.,B000237CIS
"This was a great tank for anything you want, such as exercise or just a casual tank. great quality and fits perfectly.",B000237CIS
"Brings back those painful memories of basic training! At least now I jog in the park and log like I once could go faster!!
Nice quality product as expected, it has been in the was a few times and still looks new. I ordered a small and it fitted fine.",B000237CIS
shirt said 2X but no even close more like a XL  3XL probably  won't fit Need to send it back,B000237CIS
Nice vest but I ordered a large and it was too small will have to order another one in XL as this is a really nice tank top,B000237CIS
I was in the Army for 12 years and I have to represent when I work out.  I love the fit of this top and it really does what it needs to do in the gym.,B000237CIS
"Some may expect this to be a medium to semi heavy material,  but it was made & designed for P-T...IE: Physical Training.
The material is light weight, which helps to wick the sweat from your body as you work out.  I use it for every day wear, which is fine for me as I get over heated in the summer months...and IT DOES wick away the sweat.

The ""ARMY"" logo built into the shirt when it's made, so the chances of the logo rubbing off, or washing out or disappearing in any other way...it's just NOT going to happen.

For me, this was a great buy at $8.50.",B000237CIS
Good quality fabric and logo make this a product I would highly recommend  that you add to your workout essentials,B000237CIS
"This top was just like the Army APFT uniform top, but sleeveless! It made it seem more reasonable to work out in in Afghanistan!",B000237CIS
Love it...and for a cheap price,B000237CIS
I am a repeat customer and am very satisfied with this vendor and will buy from again.,B000237CIS
The shirt washed and dried well so it fits him good.,B000237CIS
"Great shirt, really soft, good fit and good price.  What more do you need.",B000237CIS
"Great material, fits as expected. Fantastic price for the quality! Will buy more.",B000237CIS
Fits perfectly. Love that it is tagless. So soft and comfortable!,B000237CIS
Its the right size. The stitching on the bottom is coming out and the word ARMY is starting to fade but I like it,B000237CIS
I love this tank top. I want another one!,B000237CIS
Great tank top for hot days.  Matches my old Army PT shirt!,B000237CIS
My husband loved his army tank top but it was looking a little...old. So I finally found this one and it is almost identical to his old one. He loved it thank you!,B000237CIS
Looks great. Boyfriend loved it.,B000237CIS
Great tank- soft and fits perfect!,B000237CIS
"Very nice, comfortable, breathable.  just what I wanted",B000237CIS
Too small ! Wich is weird cause the same size shorts fit fine ?!? Waste of money for me. Gave them away.,B000237FEY
Excellent fit and finish so far. Seem tough and long lasting to me.,B000237FEY
Made a hit it was liked very well,B000237FEY
"These pants are tough.  Plenty of pockets, and drawstrings at the bottom of the pant legs.  Everything is closed by buttons.  No zippers.  You won't be disappointed.",B000237FEY
Fits great and seems to be well made and I love the pattern too.,B000237FEY
"Absolutely the best camo pants for the price.. i own 7 different loadouts.. these are durable. Wear size 33 pants..6'2"" 175.. medium fit perfect..",B000237FEY
This is a very nice desert camo pants. It's as if it was tailored personally for me. I can say no more!,B000237FEY
"I have both pants and shirt for desert outings, did some custom fitting, looks good",B000237FEY
"As my fellow shoppers metioned: This is the real deal! Size M (33) fits perfectly! Good quality of the fabric, awesome camo pattern! Back to the 90s",B000237FEY
outstanding quality and good price,B000237FEY
"These are just exactly like the 1980s desert BDU's developed for BRIGHT STAR, a US Army exercise in Egypt. This is the real deal. These were used in the Gulf War, but replaced with the DCU that better matched the Saudi desert. Anyway, these are perfect. Just exactly like the issued ones. Beware of knock offs. These are authentic. Some other ones you might find are not like the real government issued pants, but these are. Go with these.",B000237FEY
"Great fit, great quality, good price!",B000237FEY
The pants are a bit short but otherwise they seem to be a good product.,B000237FEY
added as part of my emergency prep gear........nice pants.,B000237FEY
"These are exactly like I wore in Egypt years ago.  I know they will wear forever, even though I won't being wearing them 7 days a week.",B000237FEY
"For something so expensive, these sure were crappy.  They were scratchy and made a horrible sound when I walked.  The fit was also terrible.  Too big in the waist/crotch, and too small in the leg.  WTF?  The color was also too light.

Don't bother with these!",B00023T290
"So many compliments on my legs when i wear them.  Very comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time.  I thought they'd be very ""fragile"", but that's not the case.  I'm not afraid to put them on and take them off.",B00023T290
Perfect. Product meet expectations.,B00023T290
While they looked beautiful and fit comfortable they tore up immediately after less than 2 hours of wearing them. I do not have long nails and I did not accidentally bumped into anything that coudl have tore this. Unfortunately it was a waste of money.,B00023T290
These hose were bunching down around my ankles by mid-morning of the first wearing.  I had to take them off by lunch.  Do not buy these!  They feel cheap for such an exorbitant price!  A cheap pair of Hanes or L'eggs would be much better.,B00023T290
"Way too big & made of a weird, cheap material that sagged at knees & ankles. Wore once, then put in trash. Complete waste of money.",B00023T290
Fantastic sheer hose. Matches perfectly my skin tone. Very satisfied!,B00023T290
My problem was less of the quality and more of the depiction in the photo. They're normal tights with a extremely slight shimmer if you're in the right light. Not worth the money spent,B00023T290
Wonderful fit and feel. They look really great and get a lot of compliments.,B00023T290
Not shiny at all like it looks in the picture,B00023T290
May it is better to say my husband loved them.  They look great and fit well.,B00023T290
"Not as shiny or shimmery as advertised, but still a nice pair of nude colored tights.",B00023T290
"Really disappointed. First of all, they were supposed to be black and were brownish. Also, this pair was clearly tried on by someone else and just bunched and put back in the bag. It was awful.

For the price, or really any price, this is unacceptable.

Will return and not purchase again!",B00023T290
"Really nice, love the color (coffee) and the sheer feel.",B00023T290
It tore after the first week. I expected better quality,B00023T290
"The person they were purchased for was thrilled with them, that's about all i know.",B00023T290
"it was exactly what i was looking for. it covers all the veins, conceals cellulite but  is invisible at the same time. it least it is not obvious the it's on. Very fragile though,use it with extreme care",B00023T290
"Very sheer, kind of gauzy.  Not that shiny.  Just looks like it on a white mannequin.",B00023T290
These fit great the only problem I have is they are not shiny at all like the picture. Mainly just a dull black. I gave 2 stars only cause of the fit but I was really looking forward to the shiny and missed out.,B00023T290
"These don't hold up well over time. My perception has been spoiled by my black Maidenform tights, which hold up much better for daily use.",B00023T290
they are more like pantyhose than tights.,B00023T290
Wife loves them. Sheet and sexy,B00023T290
"Beautifully sheer.  I wouldn't buy any other stockings. They do not bag, they make one's legs as lovely as they can be.  These are the ultimate stockings",B00023T290
"I loved the fit, the color match and the transparency. I was trying to find a quality bare hose that would help conceal skin grafts on my leggs. These did a wonderful job. I wanted to wear shorter dresses this summer and was very pleased with the outcome they did not provide full coverage but I was never expecting them to I was going for a smooth look.  I will only purchase 8 denier hose from now on.",B00023T290
Very sheer and undetectable. I followed the size chart and these were a little too big.,B00023T290
"I am not part of a generation accustomed to pantyhose, and had many doubts about wearing nude hose.  I went ahead and purchased a pair of these before an interview for a sr level position.  I LOVE them!  You can't even tell that you're wearing hose, and the golden color was perfect against my fair skin.  Buying another pair now!",B00023T290
If you wish for your legs to look their best then these pantyhose are excellent. If you want your legs to be noticed and admired these are wonderful.,B00023T290
"Fabulously sheer and perfect color.  They really let your legs look bare.  4-Stars because I followed sizing chart but these are just a bit too small.  If you're height / weight falls inbetween sizes, I'd say size up.",B00023T290
"Great looking and feeling on my legs but the shimmery does not come close to what these pictures dictate. My pair also had loose thread I guess , so when I put them on for the second time......I got a run from hell in them...lol I didn't even get  a half hour of wear time for my $16-$17 hose!! I would get another pair but I have like 5 other orders coming!!",B00023T290
"These is the best nude pantyhose out there. A German friend recommended telling me no one can tell you're wearing them, and she was right - they're perfect. I'm sold. Perfect for office wear in summertime.",B00023T290
"These are not even golden, I was really disappointed.",B00023T290
"These are so great. No one knew I was wearing ""pantyhose"" and they made my legs look great!",B00023T290
The pictures show a more metallic look yet they are nothing like the image.  They are black pantyhose with a minimal amount of shimmer to them.  I ordered these for my daughter to add to her costume but won't be able to use them now.  The image is extremely different from the actual product.  If you're looking for basic black with a tiny bit of sparkle then MAYBE you would appreciate this item.,B00023T290
"If zero stars was an option, that's what I would give. This is completely false advertising. they aren't shiny at all. They are basic, low grade panty hose that are overpriced.",B00023T290
"I wish there was a no star option!
These are not shiny like they appear in the picture, in fact, they are actually dull when on.
The material is so thin that I had a runner 20 minutes after putting them on.
Shame on them for such blatant false advertising!",B00023T290
This hosiery fit great thank you so much.,B00023T290
If i could give this product 0 stars i would. Walmarts pantyhose beats falke by a longshot. Complete waste of 45.98,B00023T290
"I like it, the inside Velcro pocket is just what I needed for change and my extra keys,and well made.",B000248PW4
Excellent.  AAAAAAAAA++++++++++,B000248PZ6
Tight fit. Beautiful. Excellent quality,B000249WB2
This item was way too small AND I RETURNED IT.,B000249WB2
"Don't expect too much.  This is probably a wear once item. That being said, it's perfect! The front closure works well as it is a snug fit and allows you to dress yourself. It's long enough to slim your torso but allows for ease in sitting without rolling up or bending. A perfect wardrobe addition.",B000249WB2
"It's a neat shirt, but the ""Kids L"" was more like and adult L. Otherwise it was neat.  Good color and nice fabric",B00024BM9M
My 10 year old LOVES this shirt and wears it all the time.,B00024BM9M
"Cute camouflage shirt.  Feels slightly thin material,  but nice overall.  Seams are well sewn,  so we'll see how well it stands up to my 9 year old!",B00024BM9M
"Runs EXTREMELY small. I ordered a medium, and it fits my 8 year old brother. Im 16. So if the size difference is 8 years then I don't even know what size to get. Disappointed.",B00024BM9M
"Fits perfectly, nice quality and very comfortable. My son likes it as it very nicely done and extremely comfortable for him.",B00024BM9M
super cute! runs super small tho :(,B00024BM9M
Loved this shirt for my son! You can't beat the quality for the price! Don't hesitate! Buy it! I also have the woodland camo one as well... ,B00024BM9M
"My 6 year old grandson won't wear it.  He says it's too ""itchy"".  The shirt has ""60% cotton, 40% polyester"" stamped on it (no tags) but ithe material does have a prickly feel to it even after I washed it.  I will wash it a few more times and see if I can get the ""itchies"" out.  Will update with my results.",B00024BM9M
Perfect fit for my 6 and 4 year old!,B00024BM9M
"Fit as expected, has not shrunk or faded with washings thus far. My kiddo loves it.",B00024BM9M
"Our grandson loves his ""camo"" shirt... Good quality!",B00024BM9M
Shirt arrived quickly as is exactly as described,B00024BM9M
Love the shirt just wish it was bigger,B00024BM9M
This fit a little smaller than expected.  I was hoping it would last for a while but he will outgrow it very soon.,B00024BM9M
My grandson likes this shirt very much. True to size.  Goes well with his camo pants.,B00024BM9M
Thicker tshirt material. Sturdy. My son loves it! Sized appropriately.,B00024BM9M
"Nice shirt, great fit. My son loves it",B00024BM9M
"The shirts were lightweight, but adequate.  The sizing was not as true, but it worked.  I have not washed them yet.",B00024BM9M
Very comfortable and durable.  My son is obsessed with camo so I was this about 2 times a week.  It has faded a little bit but that is because he uses it so much.,B00024BM9M
Great fit a bit small on the arms but it was really good looked good too,B00024BM9M
Looks better in person.  Great quality,B00024BM9M
The shirt seems nice good matteral but the size was way off I went off the size chart. It said a girl XL was a girls 6x that is not right my daughter is a 6 in everything else and I wanted it a little bigger but I can almost wear this shirt. Nice shirt just be wary of the sizing.,B00024BM9M
It looks like it runs a little big. I haven,B00024BM9M
"Cheap appearance, thin material, poor quality",B00024BM9M
Perfect for my five year old grandson,B00024BM9M
looked and felt great but it was to small,B00024BM9M
looks more like PJ's but my son really likes it for airsofting..,B00024BM9M
"He will love it, nice top to wear under a sweatshirt on a colder day. Bought size medium for a tall 7 1/2 y/o, after a wash will fit fine with a little room to grow into",B00024BM9M
grandson loves it he is into all military type stuff,B00024BM9M
"Had to return first shirt I ordered ,to small.
SECOND ONE FIT JUST FINE. NO trouble with returns.
Grandchild liked it.",B00024BM9M
he wears it as soon as it comes out of the laundry every week!,B00024BM9M
Nice product but size chart incorrect returned to purchase a smaller size,B00024BM9M
My grandson really likes this shirt!,B00024BM9M
This shirt is a nice quality but it does fit a little small in the arms.,B00024BM9M
"Very thin, scratchy material. I returned it.",B00024BM9M
minecraft-like camo was a big hit. Goes well with pants and hat!,B00024BM9M
sleeves are a bit shorter than expected.  Product came on time and very good quality.,B00024BM9M
Perfect fit. Got them for a gift for my grand son and he Loves them.,B00024BM9M
The shirt runs a little small but my son loved it.,B00024BM9M
The shirt was good quality cotton and the fit was great,B00024BM9M
"I tried to determine which size would fit my slim 5-year-old grandson and was afraid of getting a shirt too large (he has a great many he is waiting to grow into). While this one fit good when he opened it for Christmas, I fear that after a washing it will be too small.
I especially wanted this shirt as his favorite color is ""camo"".",B00024BM9M
Bought for daddy and sons photo!,B00024BM9M
"Seems to be good quality, fits well, child loves it.",B00024BM9M
Poor quality and scratchy material,B00024BM9M
"The shirt is decent, it's kind of thin, and the xl is about right, but note, that it's an XL for Children.",B00024BM9M
The elastic wrists were so small! My kid is very slim so he was able to stretch this out a bit but I don't see an average size kid wearing this without strangling his wrists!,B00024BM9M
Bought two for my boys that wanted to be Army men for Halloween. They fit comfortably and look good.,B00024BM9M
Item arrived promptly and I like the quality.  It is a little big but I expected that.  I am new to the digi camo but it will work with the military suit that will be worn.  It will be part of a Halloween Costume this year.,B00024BM9M
Perfect for the kids that are into camo,B00024BM9M
The material of this Kids Woodland Camouflage is really good and now I will now be ordering the pants and jacket to match.,B00024BM9M
"I ordered this t shirt so my grandson could be dressed up as a solider while playing with his military toys. I told him that I bought him the hat, t shirt and pants to match and he replied that he was going to wear it to school. He's so excited to receive this just because gift. Thanks Amazon",B00024BM9M
"Go one size larger. otherwise great.
Is what it is and pretty cool camo looking. Thanks..
military specs and picture match",B00024BM9M
"I am not a camouflage person but my son is, he wears it to play in the years and hide with the other girls and boys in the neighbborhood",B00024BM9M
Love this shirt. A little snug fitting but a great little shirt. My  son wears it often and when it is cold as an undershirt.,B00024BM9M
My grandson loves it!  fits well and so far is very durable.....good colors. great with a pair of jeans and tennies,B00024BM9M
Happy with the shirt & the price was very comparable & I really appreciated being able to send this birthday gift directly to my little guy...he was delighted to get something in the mail addressed to him!!,B00024BM9M
"When it arrived, it had a strong chemical smell.  It had to be washed immediately.  Son still loves it!  Runs small.",B00024BM9M
Bought 2 of these shirts with the matching pants for my zombie hunting grandsons and they love them. Good fit and nice fabric.,B00024BM9M
My grandson wanted this shirt as part of his Christmas present and it arrived the day before Christmas thank goodness. He really likes it.,B00024BM9M
This is a nice shirt for the price.  Doesn't look or feel cheap.  Gift for my grandson who likes camo clothing.,B00024BM9M
The boys love these shirts. It is nice and warm for fall and winter. Well made. The size small is probably a size 7 in boys. It is a little large on my skinny and average height almost 7 year old. We cuff the sleeves a little.,B00024BM9M
Shirt is a nice quality.  I must have misread the sizing chart as I bought a large youth and wanted a Child's large size 6-7.  It is way too big.  I'll have to save it a few years until he grows into it.,B00024BM9M
otherwise cute shirt was really really tight in the ribbing for the cuffs.  Hope it loosens up with time and stretching,B00024BM9M
When ordering I wasn't sure what size to get. This is more for a teen. Its a bit thin but we are in vegas so its ok.,B00024BM9M
Sizing not as accurate as I had hoped.  The restocking fee and return policy inhibits me from returning the shirts.  I had to find what I was looking for elsewhere.  Perhaps not a great idea to buy clothes here but the other items I have gotten were good.  Thanks,B00024BM9M
not a bad ashirt for the price. cheap and thin but it's camo and that was the biggest feature for our 5 yr old,B00024BM9M
Purchased for an 8 year old. He loves it.  Now to get him out of for washing.....oh well and so it goes.,B00024BM9M
"I rated this item with only 2 stars because the size was not true medium.  My grandson is very thin and I think after this shirt is washed and not dried, it will shrink and he will no longer be able to wear it.  I liked the material and color but the size was the major problem.",B00024BM9M
"Excellent quality
Looks great...It's a good product.",B00024BM9M
"Received as expected.  However, ordered it thinking it was more for a teen, and it is actually more for a child.",B00024BM9M
The size is too small even tho I ordered XL size but looks like x-small.,B00024BM9M
My son has very long arms and often the sleeves of longer shirts stop before his wrists. The sleeves on this were long enough. The material wasn't soft at all but not scratchy. He loves wearing this. He often pairs it with his nerf tactical vest.,B00024BM9M
"Fits as sized, good material, washes well.",B00024BM9M
"Super soft, color is very nice, washes up beautifully. We bought this in a large for our 11-year-old son, and it is perfect.",B00024BM6A
"So far the shirt looks fine and it has stood up through several washings. I wasn't expecting anything fancy. My son just wanted an ""army"" shirt, so this did the trick!",B00024BM6A
I gave this to a young man for his 5 year birthday. He liked it very much. It's a great gift for a young man. Lynne,B00024BM6A
This is a really cute shirt but order a size larger because it is made small.,B00024BM6A
Nice print. Nice quality of fabric.,B00024BM6A
purchased this as a gift for one of my sons best friends who really likes camo  I think he's really going to like this shirt.  thank you,B00024BM6A
My daughter really liked this shirt.  It does run a tad small but the colors are nice and bold.,B00024BM6A
It's a joke not a tshirt.  It's too wide and too short and too small in the neck.  It's not cut correctly and material is terrible.,B00024BM6A
Perfect shirt for toddler. great fit.,B00024BM6A
What you would expect. My son loved it.,B00024BM6A
Great camo shirt but runs very small. I read the reviews and thought I was ordering correctly. My grandson is a really skinny 7 year old and the small was way to tight. It fit my 5 yr old much better,B00024BM6A
This shirt goes with the digital camo pants I bought for my grandson's first hunting trip.  Fit was good and he was so excited.,B00024BM6A
Shirt came with 3 small holes in it around the abdomen.,B00024BM6A
Looks ok...but these run very big and the collars are stretched out for some reason,B00024BM6A
"Really long shirt, almost to my 5 year olds knees.",B00024BM6A
nice shirt but runs really small.,B00024BM6A
Seems like a nice shirt. Can't give a proper review because I cut it up for a project,B00024BM6A
"I bought my girlfriend this tshirt because she cannot stand pink, and all women's camo seems to have something pink on it. She is usually a women's medium and she asked for the boys XL. It fits well, nice Material and she says it is comfortable.",B00024BM6A
my  grand  son  liked the  t  shirt,B00024BM6A
Perfect for my son. Fit perfectly,B00024BM6A
This t-shirts were amazing. I got 7 of them zise xsmall for 3years old kids and they were perfect!.,B00024BM6A
"Shirt is a good quality shirt. Please review the size chart prior to purchasing. My son is 8 and I ordered a small expecting it to fit perfectly. He is average size and height but I wish I would have ordered a medium to give him a little more room. Otherwise, NO problems with the shirt and he loves it.",B00024BM6A
Was a bit smaller than expected. It was for good use.,B00024BM6A
My son absolutely loves this shirt so that's great but it arrived extremely faded. The colors are no where near as vibrant as the photo however he adores it so thanks for someone finally having RED camo! :),B00024BM6A
"Thank you for the shirts really love them, we will be using  them this Friday, love amazon always have everything i need",B00024BM6A
"Our son loves the shirt. We will probably order more. The quality seems good, fabric soft and design true to photo. Size was good. We ordered size large for average size 11 year old boy, but will order larger next for room to grow.",B00024BM6A
Super cute shirts at an affordable price. They run a little small but they still fit my son.,B00024BM6A
Love this shirt but way to big for my 9 year old,B00024BM6A
My 6 year old son loves it. He picked it out and wears it a lot. It is cotton and looks and feels great. I will update on durability after a while.,B00024BM6A
Very bad product not same az expeckted. Bad experience with Rothko,B00024BM6A
"My 7 year old is picky. He won't wear clothes with tags or seams or even shirts that contain iron on images because he states material too rough. He loves playing army, and when he tried on this shirt, he said stated it was soft. I just took a deep breath. Success! Great value too. Usually wears a size 8 in boys and medium fit.",B00024BM6A
Perfect for camo field day at school!,B00024BM6A
"The T-shirts are awesome for my children praise them.  The small sizes are better for the two, or three year olds. Four and five year olds the mediums fit better.",B00024BM6A
Nephew loves it. Great Product!,B00024BM6A
"I ordered a solid olive drab shirt, but received a shirt printed with ""Marines"". I had to make it work due to time constraints & turned it inside out for matching family Christmas pjs.  Size also runs VERY small. A one time use, a waste of money!",B00024BM6A
Very satisfied.  Good product.  Good seller.  Good price.,B00024BM6A
Great..my dancers love the shirts...,B00024BM6A
good strong shirt. Good material.,B00024BM6A
These were perfect fit! We had names in vinyl ironed on the back. Kids for a birthday party wore them to laser tag. It was perfectly adorable and they had a great time!,B00024BM6A
"I'm not sure why this has such good reviews. First, the photo didn't match the description, but I reported the problem so hopefully that will be fixed for everyone else. I wasn't sure whether to use the little or big boys sizes on the chart. I ordered a medium and would guess that it is about a size 7/8. It is definitely too big for my just-turned-6 boy (too long and too big in the neck). I agree with others that the quality isn't great. It's just a cheap t-shirt from China, but my son does like it.",B00024BM6A
"Size runs a bit small and it faded significantly after the first wash. My son loves it and the price can't be beat, but I am disappointed it faded so quickly.",B00024BM6A
"Well made shirt for the price, fit well and a good heavier material.",B00024BM6A
"My son wears a 5/6 in size. I read the reviews on  how these shirts run large.
I looked at their size chart & ordered a large. The shirt came, my son tried it on & it's down to his knees.",B00024BM6A
They fade away in the first wash a little disappointed,B00024BM6A
My five-year-old grandson loves his camo ones to wear this shirt every day.,B00024BM6A
the product was what we were looking for and it fit correctly and arrived promptly,B00024BM6A
"Material is a little thin, but it's fine",B00024BM6A
Good price/quality..  Just to big. It's very possible I ordered wrong though.,B00024BM6A
So far it appears to hold up after one wash. Nice shirt the kid likes it.,B00024BM6A
The shirts fits a little smaller than expected so you may need to order one size larger to ensure proper fit.,B00024BM6A
This shirt fits REALLY small.  It is extremely slim in fit.,B00024BM6A
Fit perfect! My son is hard on his clothes and this shirt has held up really well.,B00024BM6A
"My boys love to play army, and this was perfect! A little on the small size but still fits. A huge hit overall!",B00024BM6A
my grandson loves it fits good true to size,B00024BM6A
"My Grandson wants to ba ""an army man"". This shirt was perfect when paired with camo pants.  Fit was as expected and color was great. Good choice. Grammy is a hero for this present!",B00024BM6A
I'm a women's small and I purchase a large in boys and it fits perfect,B00024BM6A
AND MY GRANDSON LOVES IT. HE WANTS TO WEAR IT NOW  BUT HE HAS A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S FOR CHRISTMAS. I DID NOT WANT TO TELL HIM THAT I PURCHASED THE WHOLE SET.,B00024BM6A
My daughter had camo day at school and I couldn't find any camo shirts where I live.  I found this one on Amazon at the last minute and it was exactly what I needed. It fit her well and she liked it. It was a good price for the quality also.,B00024BM6A
I ordered an XL for my 7-year-old grandson who it rather husky. It's just huge and even too big for me. One review said it will shrink a lot but I hope that's an awful lot or he won't be able to wear it until he's ten.,B00024BM6A
"The T fit great.  Very cute...I bought them for a army/camo b-day party and they were perfect, my girls b-dazzled them lol.  They were not itchy at all.",B00024BM6A
Very nice shirt. My grandson loves it. Fit well and good quality.,B00024BM6A
Great t shirt Grandson loved it.,B00024BM6A
"Nice coloring, comfy material... my son loves it!",B00024BM6A
"I went by the size chart for little boys:
4 S(4) 3-4 Years
5 M(5) 4-5 Years
6 L(6) 5-6 Years
7 XL(7) 6-7 Years
I wanted a large for size 5-6, but the only size that was Prime was the XL, a size 7, (I wanted to use my Prime since this was needed for an army birthday party and didn't want to chance it not arriving in time) so I went ahead and ordered that, figuring it would be ok to be loose-it was way too large for my grandson, but fit his mom just fine!  The shirt is made of cotton fabric that is definitely not soft.",B00024BM6A
Exactly what my daughter needed! Great shirt.,B00024BM6A
"The shirt is exactly as pictured and a great price. The sizing runs a bit large and long. I ordered a youth Large and it seems more like an adult XS or S. The material is quite stiff but, I am washing it now and hope that will fade with time. As a side note...the item arrived much quicker than I thought it would....just in time for my daughter to wear for spirt week!",B00024BM6A
It fit perfectly. It was a great buy for camo day at school.,B00024BM6A
"Bought for my Granddaughter, she loved it.",B00024BM6A
"Actually, I bought it for my dog for halloween.  It fits a female golden retreiver well !",B00024BM6A
I am leaving this for any future prospective buyers.  The shirt is a nice quality and my 3 year old loves it.  Here is some sizing information for you.  My 3 year old son takes a 4T but his 4T clothes are a bit big on him.  I bought the Extra Small and it fits him nicely.  Hope that helps someone with the sizes.,B00024BM6A
Bought for my grandson.  He was very happy with it.,B00024BM6A
Decent quality. Daughter liked it.,B00024BM6A
My son is a 10 regular.  I got him a large.  Fits great.  He loves it.  I think sizing runs a little small.  Color and quality are good.,B00024BM6A
This shirt is very long.  It washes nicely and becomes very soft.  My grandsons love the shirts.,B00024BM6A
We got this for our 10 year old for his birthday.  He loves it.  Quality seems good.  The color is also quite good.  Overall very pleased with this purchase.,B00024BM6A
Cute shirts that are a little tight and shrink loads.  Order 2 sizes big if you don't want a tight shirt.  After first wash will fit better.,B00024BM6A
"Loved it, matches our baseball teams uniforms.  They look great on the sideline cheering on the boys.  Thank you very much",B00024BM6A
Bought these for a Nerf birthday. Good quality and nice print but it ran a bit small should have taken large.,B00024BM6A
"I bought this shirt in a size small for three grandsons aged 3, 4, 5 respectively. If fits them comfortably loose. The material seems thick and comfortable, as well as soft. I bought these shirts as an accessory to kid-sized Woodland Green Battle Dress Uniforms.",B00024BM6A
"I ordered this for my almost 8-year old, who is a little bigger than average.  I decided on the large based on another review stating it ran a little small because I figured a little big is better than too small.  They sent me XL!!!  I am 5'4 and weigh 110, and this shirt fits me loosely.  The shirt itself is nice quality, and the colors are great.  However, it does run big, and the seller made a mistake in sending me the wrong size.",B00024BM6A
I ordered this shirt earlier today but when it showed up in my ordered items it says it is sky blue camo. I didn't want a sky blue camo one--I am not sure why the photo doesn't match what shows up in your ordered items.,B00024BM6A
"Cute for my daughter on Camo-Day!  Fit was good, and the quality is well enough.  Kids liked it and got to wear it on camo-day.",B00024BM6A
"Cute for my daughter on Camo-Day!  Fit was good, and the quality is well enough.  Kids liked it and got to wear it on camo-day.",B00024BM6A
"After first wash it is falling apart at the seems. I ordered a total of 8 of the camo shirts....all different sizes.  All were pretty true to size except the men's large was the same if not a tad smaller than the women's large.  The boys and girls shirts fit as I wanted...big.  The extra small was for my 2 yr old, small for the 4 yr old. Youth med for the 6 yr old and 8 and youth large for my 9 yr old.  I got a large for my hubby and I.  Mine fits me (I am 9 mo. Preggo) but the large for him fits tight.  Out of all the shirts we purchased two were falling apart at the seems after the first wash.",B00024BM6A
"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter and I got a Medium.  She is small for her age but I would normally buy her a size 7.  But since the only options were small medium and large, and after reading the reviews, I went with a medium.  It is way way too big.  I should have gone with a small or XS.  So I am disappointed because she is going to wear it for pictures.  Instead of sending it back, I'll just have to cut and sew it myself.
The colors are really bright and it's a pretty nice shirt.  It could be a little thicker though in my opinion.",B00024BM6A
"Bought this for a costume for my kids school play. An all around quality product, it fit as expected and washed well. Quick shipment was a plus.",B00024BM6A
Grandson wanted camo for his b-day he was really happy with it he said he would recommend it to all kids,B00024BM6A
"I did not like this shirt. The quality was good but it did
not fit my daughter as expected. Thanks",B00024BM6A
"Got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. Very comfy, and the size fits him perfectly. Color is nice and It washed up great, too.",B00024BM6A
"My nephew was thrilled with his came shirt. The quality of the shirt was great for the price. Walmart wanted double for a basic camo shirt. I was a little disappointed that the shirt was balled up and wrapped in plastic but after ironing it out it was presentable. All in all great purchase,",B00024BM6A
"Really surprised at the quality of this shirt.  Very pleased and received quickly.  You will not be disappointed.  Sizing looks
good, but it will depend on how quickly the boys have grown.",B00024BM6A
Everything was fine. Just wish you had one section with kids camouflage clothing including the pants to go with the shirts.,B00024BM6A
"I bought 2 shirts in different sizes for my nieces to have matching outfits.  After reading reviews I bought medium & large so they wouldn't be too small, but when they came they were much larger than I thought.  At least they can grow into them being a little big, but they are good quality and I am happy with the purchase.",B00024BM6A
i Bought A Large And It Fits My Daughter And She Wears A 7/8  In Kids Shirts  It isA Little Big But Not Much.,B00024BM6A
"Bought this shirt for my son to wear at our wedding reception, we had King of the Ring and his name put on it. Its not really authentic pattern but it gets the point across. Also the fabric is a little thin so I suggest putting another shirt underneath if its going to be chilly.",B00024BM6A
"I bought 2 items same size same brand, same size on label but one is smaller than other so I can't give good rate for it",B00024BM6A
"We are commercial screen printers, & we purchased these shirts (all sizes) for a school event. The shirts printed nicely; our customer was well-pleased. The only problem was the availability of all sizes in a timely fashion.",B00024BM6A
Fit well. I need crickets bright pink color. Nice thick cotton. A little stiff at first but washed nicely and I'm sure will be softer with further washes.,B00024BM6A
this is a very nice quality t-shirt. It will look great for our family pictures that we will have taken next month,B00024BM6A
"The quality of the shirt is just fine.  it is, however, extremely LONG.  We got a 4T for a 3-1/2 year old, and it fit as expected in the body, but we could tuck it into his boot!  We actually hemmed this last weekend, and now its all good.  I have the adult version as well, and there were no length issues.",B00024BM6A
Work out well. Could have been softer but overall very good quality. Brought for my daughter who absolutely loves it !,B00024BM6A
"the fabric does not have much stretch or give to it, but i washed one and it didn't shrink.  so worked out.  i got these for a 5yo party.  they fit all the boys nicely.",B00024BM6A
Great shirt. matches camaflouge pants.,B00024BM6A
Shirt isn't a color match for the BDU pants but my little soldier doesn't mind. His imagination is still going strong.,B00024BM6A
shirt was not of good quality and is thin.,B00024BM6A
"Got this shirt from the warehouse. Son loves it, I love the price, Its a win.",B00024BM6A
"after wash, the material has tiny fur-like on this shirt, and color looks not so dark as new.",B00024BM6A
"This bra could be sexy if the opening was bigger. I ordered a 36D and the whole fit was nowhere close to a D cup, when I tried to arrange things all I got was Very Pointed Rocket Boobs. The opening needs to be bigger if the cup size is larger. Returned item",B00024EK0K
"The bra is not alailable in cup sizes, thus falls short of being properly sized, as I need an ""A-Cup"" Size 38............",B00024EK0K
Bought this for my wife on Christmas kind of as a joke. We both love it and will be buying more like it.,B00024EK0K
Tried this one and ended up leaving it on and it was more comfortible then the normal bra.. ;),B00024EK0K
This bra is fun and actually provides more support and separation then expected but it does not come in cup sizes.  If you are larger than a large C cup you are probably better off with a different bra.,B00024EK0K
I bought this for my wife and absolutely love how it looks on her.  I wish she would wear it more often.,B00024EK0K
nice product and excellent seller,B00024EK0K
I like how it fit and I felt free and sexy. I would rebuy.,B00024EK0K
The bra comes in very large rib sizes which does not match the cup size.  The cup size does not go up enough to match rib cage size.  No support for natural breasts.  This bra is made for tiny tiny breasts or for implants only.,B00024EK0K
Bought this for my wife. She likes it and wears it out on weekends... I love it at the end of night... Fits her large breast and love the open nipples. Recommend to everyone.. it's is sexy and fun.,B00024EK0K
"Fits great and I feel sexy, sexy, sexy when I wear it - it is definitely at the TOP of my boyfriend's favorites list now : )",B00024EK0K
"Ordered a 34M, doesn't work for C cups. Makes the shakers look funny. Perhaps if the holes were larger....doesn't suit the audience.",B00024EK0K
Super sexy and shows just enough.,B00024EK0K
openings were larger than I expected ...just wanted small opening so there is still ample support for the breasts in the size D.  But overall a 4 rating.,B00024EK0K
"Doesn't fit a large breasted woman. I'm 38DD, I ordered a 38 but the cup is small. Would work for a b or c cup woman. My boyfriend still loved it.",B00024EK0K
"i returned it. can't wear it, it was too small. don't buy !",B00024EK0K
Fit is great...heats up the bedroom quickly!,B00024EK0K
"Unfortunately, there is only one cup size, so if you are B cup or smaller, this should work OK.  Any larger, and you may not like the appearance because the opening will deform your breasts.  Bra is very comfortable, and certainly will get a man's attention!  Quality is good, but not outstanding.  This product could be much better if manufacturer did more R&D and upgraded the materials quality.",B00024EK0K
"The band, which was supposed to be 36 inches, fit fine. The adjustable shoulder straps also were fine. The materials are comfortable and pretty, and the construction seems sturdy. The cup is supposed to be one size fits all, and... well, I expect it is one size fits many, but...  Let's just say when I put it on I started laughing. There was overflow on all sides and unattractive flooding out the open tip. If you have a large cup size, this is comic and clownish, not sexy. If you have a more reasonable cup size (maybe up to a D or DD if I had to guess, but it is just a guess) I think you'd be pleased with this product.",B00024EK0K
"I saw this and just had to get it for my grandson who loves anything camo.  The quality was excellent and will give him MANY opportunities to wear it.

"I was the perfect fit, quick receipt of product and the coat was true to size.  My nephew loves it.",B00024EZ2I
"Ok.. so I'm going on my thrid coat from them.  The first one I got was way to big for my 8 year old.  I ordered a small.  You would think when it says kids that when my son normally wears a medium a small would be to small.  I read the reviews and they said it runs large... and boy does it.  Had to return it for and xs.  Which, is still a little to big but wearable.  Well, it would be wearable if the zipper worked!!! so I'm waiting on the third one... my some loves this jacket or i would just return it and be done.  If this one doesn't work I am done!",B00024EZ2I
"This jacket is almost like the adult version with the exception of the liner.  The liner in the kids jacket is not removable.  Choosing the right size was a concern as finding a size chart was near impossible.  Along with the other reviews, this linked helped http://www.rothco.com/sizechart.html.  We purchased the medium for our 12 year old daughter (tall and skinny) and it is a perfect it.",B00024EZ2I
This was bought for a Christmas gift for a young boy.,B00024EZ2I
Very high quality. Just like the real thing only smaller.,B00024EZ2I
My son is 10 and loves it. I bought a size bigger so he can grow into it and have it a long time. Still fits wonderfully.,B00024EZ2I
"Very Nice. Made well and would have been perfect for my 7 yr old; however, it was too Big. We ordered a small...thinking that would be a good fit. He is a slender average size 7 year old. This was too big. We need an XSmall. The arms were too long and the body and width. So, we are returning it to get the XSmall. But VERY nice coat.",B00024EZ2I
"These M-65 field jackets are a thick, durable winter coat; however, it is impossible to accurately shop for the right size. The size chart said a Small (S) should fit 3-4 years, and there is no explanation of Extra Small (XS). I bought 2 XS and 2 S for my four grandsons between 4 and 7. The coats and sleeves hang to the floor. ""Boys Woodland Camo M-65 Field Jacket"" should be sold as ""Teenage Boys Woodland Camo M-65 Field Jacket."" I'm disappointed. For kids under ten years, I suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rothco-Kid-s-Reversible-Camo-Raincoat/dp/B007SWFDA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rothco - Kid's Reversible Camo Raincoat</a>, because it shows little kids sizes like 5/6.",B00024EZ2I
"bought this for my 7 year old grandson, but it was much too big so I had to return it",B00024EZ2I
Loved the jacket.  Worth the money.  Theres a nice lining on the inside,B00024EZ2I
"Excellent coat, this is a gift for my step-son. So I am so please its even better than I believed. Fits as expected.",B00024EZ2I
Good copy of a m-65. Though while not military grade it is good enough for a child.,B00024EZ2I
Runs very very BIG!! My son wears a Med. I ordered a small and its still to big. Mostly arm and body lengths.  It fits the torso fine so he wears it. Oh and its pretty thick and warm.,B00024EZ2I
It's a little to big for my daughter but I love it.,B00024EZ2I
"My son loves his field jacket. He feels like his daddy now. The medium was really long on him, but we couldn't send it back because as soon as it arrived he was wearing it.",B00024EZ2I
"Purchased size XL for my son.  The good news is that they are proportioned to fit kids.  For reference, my son is 12 years old, 5'3"", 93 lbs, with a 26/27 inch waist (tall and thin).  He is in the Civil Air Patrol and wears this with his BDUs.  The XL jacket is roomy enough to be worn over his BDU top/blouse (as it should be).  However, this jacket is in no way comparable to a genuine military issued field jacket.  These are not the same quality, type of fabric, make, or warmth.  The fabric is not weather / wind / water resistant when compared side by side with my older child's genuine field jacket. (ie: This jacket absorbed every drop of water whereas the other repelled the water.  Translated: one child was soaked and the other was mostly dry.). This jacket does not have a removable liner.  This jacket is made to resemble a field jacket, but is not the same. As long as you know that, it's all good. For what it is, it seems to be decent quality construction.  I also personally don't care for the bright shiny brass zipper, compared to the matching green zipper on the genuine issue field jacket.  Overall, I'm disappointed and not impressed with it as a field jacket.",B00024EZ2I
"I bought a large and I would say it fit well as my son wears a 14-16. After reading the reviews I wasn't sure but it seems to be true to size. Here is a nice lining inside, like with a flannel jacket that most people wear in the winter.",B00024EZ2I
"Got this for one of my grandsons who says he wants to be a Marine one day like his grandfather and his step grandfather.. Sadly, when I sent him some WW2 films, he asked, Do the Marines always die?
I told him no since both his grandfather and his step grandfather survived their wars..",B00024EZ2I
The product arrived faster that I expected it to arrive and the quality exceeded my expectations. Now a days tube socks of this quality are hard to find.,B000257M0Y
"The socks were great. Exactly what I needed for my girls softball team, and they work for all different shoe sizes on the team(ordered all small)",B000257M0Y
"Pretty sure that i'm going to buy about 5 more pairs of these babies. I got one for my wife, my step mom, and myself. Everyone loves them. Thank you.",B000257M0Y
I got what I ordered the socks looked just exactly like the picture and I was please because it matched my daughters uniform well,B000257M0Y
"I got what I expected.  The sock size wasn't the correct one, but it worked out because they aren't as long as some socks.",B000257M0Y
"My 11 year old son plays basketball, and he likes to wear ""high socks"" so when he lands on the ground, he can slide, and not get floor burns.  These worked great!  And the color matched his uniform perfectly!  We even gave a pair to a friend of his on the team, now the two of them are sporting a ""new style"" during games! We had to exchange the first pairs for a larger size, but once we got the ""adult"" size, they worked great!",B000257M0Y
I was thrilled to find these soccer socks online.  My son plays for a preschool team and was given a uniform and upon leaving one game with grandparents managed to take off and lose just one neon green sock.  No local retailer carried soccer socks for kids in such a color.  I was told to keep searching.  I found these and no one even knew he was without his uniform because I ordered on Tues. or Wed. and they were in by Friday!  We made it the Sat. game in full neon green uniform!,B000257M0Y
"Just the color I was looking for. I didn't read the discription well enough when I ordered them, as I was expecting dress socks, but I wore then nonetheless and am quite pleased.",B000257L7I
Socks were thick which I admit! I have size 13 foot. Barely had the sock go up past my ankle. Gave away to friend who has size 9 foot. Disappointed! Stay away if shoe size is 11-14.,B000257L7I
"Right size, right quality, and made in the USA.  Both son's are travel soccer players and we have a hard time finding socks that have the right amount of stretch.  They like these.",B000257L7I
"The socks fit the description, but they don't look like the picture. I went by the picture instead of the description. I was expecting high quality purple dress socks, but these were florescent purple, really thick, knee-high athletic socks. Oh well.",B000257L7I
Nice colors and if you have very skinny legs these socks will be the thing.  I mean no one who has a leg wider then a broom handle will be wearing these socks.  I threw mine out.,B000257L7I
I actually took these and filled them with dry rice and sewed the end. They can then be heated in the microwave and put around your neck for aches and pains. Much cheaper than the ones you see at the mall. The bright colors made them pretty. Nice heavy socks.,B000257L7I
"Great socks!  Very snug, but in a good way.  I was surprised at how long they were.  They went great with my Incredible Hulk costume.",B000257L7I
I bought a pair of these tube socks to use for my Jack Nicholson Joker Halloween costume.  They stay up all day and night and won't fall down.  They are very long socks that go all the way up to my kneecaps.  They are tube socks if there ever were tube socks.  They are made of 80% hi-bulk acrylic and 20% stretch nylon.  The adult size range is 9-15.  I highly recommend them.,B000257L7I
"I am very tall with a narrow foot and have been buying this sock for years to wear with dress shoes. It is much thicker than a normal dress sock which is great for when your shoes are a touch too wide. The sock is also much taller than the average dress sock which helps close the gap between your shoe and pant leg when you sit down. It is a tube sock so I was concerned that it wouldn't look right as compared to a traditional wool dress sock. I was surprised to find that it looks fine and have come back to purchase this sock again. This may be an unorthodox use, but it sure solved a problem for me.",B000257L7I
"We needed green socks. They are green. What else can you say, they are socks too.",B000257L7I
I like how tall these socks are as I wear shorts during the winter. They just take me a few minutes to get on. They are a little tight.,B000257L7I
"This is not quite the sock I was looking for.
So when I tried to return then for an exchange the seller's website won't let me return them.
The electronic ""form"" you fill out keeps resetting itself allowing you to get nowhere.
Quite frustrating.",B000257L7I
"Durable. The foot portion is cushioned with extra fabric. They are super warm, but breathable so your feet don't get sweaty!",B000257L7I
They matched my jeans perfectly.,B000257L7I
"The socks are huge. I guess I was expecting a size that was more on the normal sized end. My husband who is 6'1 says these are big. But overall, they are thick and they work well.",B000257L7I
"Love super thick acrylic socks.  I am always looking for the acrylic or orlon socks of days gone by.  I was hoping these would be as thick as stated in the description, but alas, they are not. The fit is fine. But of you're looking for the heavyweight cushion pillow like thickness, these are not those socks.",B000257L7I
"Very comfy. Bought them for my sister, and she likes them.",B000257L7I
make feet sweat a lot not breathe-able very loose fit very uncomfortable,B000257L7I
"Luscious colors, fits, over the calf but not the knee",B000257L7I
These socks are great!  I was so surprised at the quality of the material.  These are very thick and incredibly warm.  I've paid $20 for winter socks that didn't feel as comfortable as these.  They also have nice foot padding.,B000257L7I
"Very comfortable, fit well, are long enough, great colors great price.",B000257L7I
I have always found it extremely difficult to find winter weight over the calf socks. These work OK if you pull them up really hard but like all the manufacturers they cheat on the length. They fit perfectly the first time but less and less so as you wash them.,B000257L7I
I was hoping for something with more stretch. It's fine for people with skinny legs but these are just long tube socks. Have to give them to charity.,B000257L7I
"For the price, there are better deals out there",B000257L7I
"These are very nice and stay up, but I am a bigger girl, so they're tight on the calves. Otherwise, they're perfect!",B000257L7I
I just got this for a Halloween costume. I was an injured Dolphins player. The color was exactly the Dolphins color.,B000257L7I
"Excellent tube socks overall. These fit well, and reach over the calf as desired.  The socks hold on the calf reasonably well without being uncomfortable and they feel good while wearing them.

Color and color fastness is good.  I wear black usually, but have purchased a  few other colors for some specialty wear.  The other colors are bright and look good.

The socks wear well except for the heel.  After a relatively short time, the heels wear thin, but don't break through for a while longer.  Some reinforcement in the heel would move these socks to a five star rating.

I am a repeat buyer due to all the good qualities, but I do wish the heel wear was better.",B000257L7I
Bought these for my son. He loves them! Very comfortable and wash well.,B000257L7I
Perfect. Just what I wanted. Thanks.,B000257L7I
The socks fit well and look good too.,B000257L7I
My daughter's soccer socks. A little long for her but she says they are comfortable.,B000257L7I
"Great sock, and it stays up and doesn't fall down.  Great for tall boots or even rain boots.",B000257L7I
Great socks but they wear out very quickly. I have holes on the heels of both feet after only a few uses during soccer,B000257L7I
They are very tight around the calves. If you even have somwhat big calves they will fit tight. Color was great for St. Patty's Day.,B000257L7I
"Seemed tight, hard to get on smoothly. We did not need them for sports, so maybe this snug fit
 is a good thing for sports.",B000257L7I
"Love these socks! I am a little short, so these socks come up to my knees but they feel great, As thick as these are my feet will be warm in the winter(hmmm toasty).",B000257L7I
"These are not ""heavy weight"" socks.",B000257L7I
"For a low cost soccer (sports sock) they are suitable. I have worn them over 10 games, washed them at least 10 times, and they appear to hold up, but I am not sure they will hold up for more than two or three seasons. Overall, they are comfortable.",B000257L7I
"Good fit, good cushioning, warm but not too thick.",B000257L7I
These are just great for my grandson's  tackle gear.,B000257L7I
Quality is good and fit for my size 12 foot is very comfortable.  Only con is after washing twice note they are more loose and do not stay up on my leg as I am wearing them.,B000257L7I
"When you are female and have 13AAA feet and correspondingly long legs, getting actual knee socks that rise to the knee can be a challenge. These sports socks are probably intended to have the tops cuffed, but for long-legged individuals, it comes right to the bottom of the knee and is comfortable.",B000257L7I
"I love how well these socks stay up at my knee. They also fit comfortably to my knee.  With a 34"" inseam, getting socks long enough is a big problem.  They are soft and fuzzy, and are wearing well.  I love them, and the bright colors that are available.",B000257L7I
"These socks are barely tall enough (some would say too short), and the elastic has gotten weak after only a few wearings.",B000257L7I
Calf is tighter than expected. Softer than expected,B000257L7I
Wore these to the Steelers game! Kept my feet warm and showed off my team spirit.,B000257L7I
"The socks have a snug fit and are not very stretchy. The color is much brighter and lighter than pictured- closer to a deep sky blue or azure (more blue than green). They are soft and seem well constructed, so I'll keep them.",B000257L7I
Perfect for what I needed them for!,B000257L7I
BRIGHT!!! These socks are extremely bright as the picture indicates. They are durable and have lasted a couple of seasons already without any signs of visible wear. They fit as expected.,B000257L7I
I have a little wider leg but I was still able to get these on. Feels very light and comfy. No slippage,B000257L7I
"very thin material, way way to long, won't fit if you have even medium size legs, would not buy if I were you",B000257L7I
These socks fuzzed up immediately. Won't purchase again.,B000257L7I
I like them! They fit nicely and comfortably. color is nicely neon!,B000257L7I

"Sock pair of socks, stay up during my softball games.  They are a little big for me, but I'm short so everything is pretty much big on me.",B000257L7I
"Very Comfy, right up to the knee. Quite warm as well. A good pair of socks for the winter months in a cheery color!",B000257L7I
These socks are good quality in material and color. They fit nice and high on the thigh if desired or mid calf. They stay in place after wearing and washing several times. So far so good. I would recommend.,B000257L7I
"Ouch .. they fit great and stayed up all day ..  The down side is that when I washed them .. they totally fell apart  .. Un wearable at this point .. Cant afford  to buy socks that you wear once and throw away ..  Sorry ..

I  kept them for display",B000257L7I
"I would of liked the socks to be a little taller, I am really tall and the didn't come all the way up.  These should fit fine for most people though.",B000257L7I
i love these socks i will always go to seller to order them. They fit great and stand up to washing over and over the colors I have order are great and don't fade.,B000257L7I
"I bought the socks as advertised ""Bermuda socks"", but they are not long enough for turning them below the knee.",B000257L7I
"I wanted to put a little color into my work clothes so I picked pink, neon green, electric blue, and have I ever gotten a response!!- literally jaw dropping. Of course, I work in a factory where white is the color of choice!- I love them!",B000257L7I
"I was hoping they wouldn't be quite such heavy socks, but they pleased their new owners, so that's all that really mattered.",B000257L7I
A little brighter than the pics - but hubby loved them.  He always wanted yellow socks & I found them.....a happy day.,B000257L7I
"Using them for Granny Basketball--keep me warm too. They are bright, but that is what I was looking for. Thanks!",B000257L7I
"I found these socks to be thicker than I expected, which helps when you stand on your feet all day. They fit me
well, and I have not had any issues with them at all. I recommend highly.",B000257L7I
comfy & black light & great price why do I need to give 13 more valueless words when that says it all?,B000257L7I
"I use these for indoor soccer, they're cheap but they do the job well. The turf doesn't stick to them either.",B000257L7I
He has to wear steel toed boots for work and these socks don't slide down into his boot. It's becoming more difficult to find over the calf socks for men that aren't white. It's a good durable sock and washes well.,B000257L7I
"I like the long, OTC, style, the thick, textured fabric, so comfortable to wear.  Received on time, excellent quality.  Would buy again.",B000257L7I
I bought these for my teenager for softball and they are great!  They came faster than they were suppose to (4 days).  They are super long and thick and great great great!,B000257L7I
These socks are a repeat buy!  Have yet to see any real wear from them but had to have more! Buy 'em!!,B000257L7I
These went waaaaaaaaay up my father's leg. The whole leg. What a laugh. Please revise your description. Buy shorter socks.,B000257L7I
"I was very pleased with these socks.  As everyone else says, they are definitely high quality and well worth the extra few bucks.  We actually used them to make ""tentacles"" (glued purple circles on them) for our arms -- we were the cheering squad for a roller derby team with a neon green & purple octopus as the mascot.  Good times!  And holy cow... they are not kidding about these being NEON GREEN!",B000257L7I
"11/10, would definitely buy again. Very nice and warm, works well with snow boots.
It's funny, as I initially bought these as part of a Halloween costume.",B000257L7I
Every year I buy some of this socks. They are the best! Comfortable and long lasting.,B000257L7I
"I've bought these twice over the past 5 years, and they're super comfortable and not too constricting like other socks, yet they stay up on your calf. I wear these both for sport & to go with combat boots!

The colors are true and as bright and neon as advertised (I've bought yellow red and blue).

Note that after 3-4 months of wear (say after ~60 wears), the sock starts to fray on the heel and toe area and pieces of colored fluff will be on your home carpets.. a nice parting gift to whomever's home you visit!",B000257L7I
"My boyfriend loves purple, great quality",B000257L7I
Nice and heavy. fit as expected.,B000257L7I
I really liked these. Would buy another pair.,B00025FS64
"These arrived promptly but I was a little disappointed. I wanted crew socks; couldn't find any and settled for these. They're VERY long, and tight at the top.",B00025FS64
"Great quality, long lasting sock. My husband loves the bright colors and gets lots of compliments in the office",B00025FS64
"Reasonably durable but awkward fit; only comes up 2"" above ankle, not above calf as shown in picture;

There is also no heel area sewn in by design, so foot is squashed and in with bunching in front.",B00025FS7I
I made sure to double check the size chart before ordering and according to that chart I ordered the correct size but when I received it I was unable to zip it up. The arms and shoulders are just fine but the body was smaller than advertised.,B00026LHGS
"At first look, this jacket is well put together.  At closer inspection, even though the construction is solid, a few things stand out:  First is that the zipper is mounted on the left side, as one might expect to see on a woman's jacket.  Second is that the ""security"" title is on the right side breast area, where normally this would be located on the left side breast area.  So, where the jacket is solidly constructed, those two details appear to be backwards.  Otherwise a well made jacket.",B00026LHGS
After a while the letters in back fade,B00026LHGS
Button ripped right off jacket. Needto send back,B00026LHGS
Fits great just not great in the winter.,B00026LHGS
EXCELLENT jacket~ very warm but not to bulky-great price too,B00026LHGS
Its a very good jacket but little to small..is there any way i can return this for 2x ..,B00026LHGS
"Heeding the warnings about the Rothco jackets, I ordered the medium and it fit great.  I wear a large normally, with the occasional XL, so I was pleased that the jacket fit me perfect.  Deeper green then the product image but I knew that going in having seen this jacket in real life.  This included the liner which is normally sold separately so that was awesome too.",B00026LI4O
"I received the product in a timely manner. I normally wear an XL and this came about a size to big. But it is made to go over various gear and other clothes to keep you warm. When I was in the military they were also a bit large for there size. For the same reason. Kit you are buying this as your only piece of outer wear go a size smaller other wise go your normal size knowing it is designed to go over gear and other items.
Alone it is very warm but is even warmer for those really mornings and is a great outer layer for those wrap and peel days.",B00026LI4O
"Well for some strange reason I listened to the other reviews and went with a smaller size, normaly I wear a large,x-large but since it is intended to be worn over a uniform at the last minute I went with m-reg and it fits like a glove with just enough room for a sherpa lined zip up hoody undernieth. The stitching is great, the zipper is heavy duty, the lining is easy to put on and take off and the overall quality is something I would expect for a $75 to $100 dollar jacket and at $65 it is a bargain but the most important thing of all is that I would buy another.

The reason I gave it four stars, no side pockets to stick my hands into to give myself that cool, bored look.",B00026LI4O
"I purchased this jacket for a six and a half month training program for my job, and it held up very well.  Despite being out in inclement weather almost every day, I remained warm when I wore this jacket.  It also held up well in the rain.  Really the only complaint that i have about the jacket is the liner.  It comes out too easy.  I fixed that by adding a little thread to the button slots... problem solved.  After the training program, the jacket is still in good shape, and I have a feeling I am going to have it a long time.",B00026LI4O
"Just got this jacket, looks like a classic M65.  I got the XL based on numerous reviews about the sizing; I'm 6'4"" and 270 so XXL is the norm for me.  I will say that it's a tad tight in the shoulders, and a little on the short side (unfortunately they don't make a ""tall""), but workable.  I look forward to wearing it all fall in sunny Cleveland!",B00026LI4O
"Received this after much deliberation on what to purchase. Decided on this brand based on price vs features. It's well put together, with good attention to detail.

The Velcro at the wrist does not allow the sleeve to be cinched tightly to keep out wind. It's a minor thing to move it or add another piece of Velcro. The brass zipper is much more smooth than plastic zippers on other coats I have. The included button-in liner makes it great for colder weather, and the fabric itself is heavy enough to keep you comfortable without the liner for chilly spring mornings. Without extra layers, I wouldn't recommend this for frigid weather at all. If I had to make one complaint, it would be that the one upper bellows pocket isn't as large as preferred. Not a deal breaker, but it would be nice to have the ability to put more in.

Regarding the sizing, it does run large. I normally purchase size large in coats. Based on other reviews I almost purchased this in a small, but at the last minute I decided to try a medium and hope for the best. I'm glad I did - a small would have been snug with the liner, and would have been uncomfortable with an added layer. The medium fits me exactly as a Columbia parka sized large. The sleeves are long enough to cover part of my hands when standing normally, and part of the cuff folds out to cover even more if needed. This would make it great when it's cold enough for gloves.

Overall, if you're looking for this style of jacket without spending the money for an authentic military surplus, I highly recommend this one.",B00026LI4O
I purchased this as a jacket to go with my scouting uniform. I love it!,B00026LI4O
It is a great as the one I can no longer fit into that I wore in Vietnam!,B00026LI4O
"Quality has slipped some. My last Rothco M-65 was made much better. I bought that one maybe 10 years ago. It is actually still in good shape, I've just outgrown it to the point that it was just too small to continue wearing. The hood is joined to the lacket with some stretchy guaze-like material. I'm sure it will tear at some point. The storm flap at the bottom of the hood that flips down over the zippered opening for the hood is too short and will let water in between the lining and the shell. I was never worried about any of this with my old jacket. The hood is also made of what seems to be the same material as the jacket, only its softer and absorbs water quickly rather than shedding it.  I don't think it's treated with water repellent. My old jacket's hood was treated nylon or polyester and shed water pretty well. The strap that closes the collar at the neck is too short. I can use it, but it would be much easier to use if it were just an inch longer. The sleeve points that turn under and inside of the sleeve and have the velcro to secure them are shorter and just don't look or feel quite right. The velcro on the sleeve cuffs that is used to adjust the tightness of the cuffs is smaller and doesn't allow as much adjustment as on my previous jacket. I can't tighten the cuffs around my wrist as much. The lining is also inferior to the old one, though it does keep me warm, it just feels cheaper and noisier and generates more static electricity than my old one did. The button tabs at the liner sleeves are also little elastic loops instead of nylon strips with the button hole, making them harder to button in, and the sleeves of the liner are shorter and don't come as far down on the wrist as the old one. There is about a 3 inch section at my wrist that is not covered by the liner sleeves. Despite all this, I've worn the new M-65 all winter since I got it and through some much colder than normal temps and it has kept me warm. I'm just not sure it will past me 10 years like my last one.",B00026LI4O
"I just received my small regular jacket (I'm 5'10""/155lbs) and love it! It's the same quality and feel of the field jacket I was issued in the Army back in the 80's. The new coat was very crisp feeling and I prefer more of a relaxed fit so I washed both the liner and coat before wearing and immediately felt a difference in softness. The puffed up nicely, which seems to enhance it's warmth and comfort. In the Army I personally never used the fold under sleeve extenders to cover the wrists and wish they would just get rid of that feature because the sleeve openings look somewhat sloppy. This is a great coat that can easily work for three seasons, possibly for Summer in temperate climates.  When in doubt, order a size smaller. This coat is a keeper!",B00026LI4O
"Really nice jacket, but could not give it 5 stars due to the differences from an genuine military issue M65. The size seems to be spot on, ordered a size large and seems to match up perfect to my military large regular M65. Furthermore, the material, zippers, and buttons all seem to be good quality and are located in the correct spots.

The differences are the material of the jacket does not appear to be at the same level as a military issue M65, feels a bit lighter to me. The built in hood is a little different and think a military issue M65 hood is a better design, but I don't really care because I have never used the hood on one of these anyways. Lastly, the inner layer of material is sewn together at the bottom with the outer layer, whereas on a military issue M65 it is not sewn, but I don't see this as really mattering too much.

So, while the jacket does vary from a military issue M65, I think over all it is a good quality jacket for the price.",B00026LI4O
"Quality is a little skeevie. Just feels cheap. Surplus ones are a lot nicer, but impossible to find in OD. A lot of single stitching where I feel there should be double stitching. Looks great, fit was accurate. I usually wear a large coat. Ordered medium, and the sleeves are just a bit long, but I can live with it.

 Great jacket for a colder environment. The sleeves are long and work AMAZING with gloves. The removable liner rocks. With liner installed, you could easily stand a northern winter with a t shirt underneath. Without, youll be perfect wearing a flannel or hoodie.

FINAL THOUGHTS: Worth the money they're charging. Quality is ok, fit is as expected, looks GREAT. Wish they used double stitching and better Velcro, but cant complain for $72. Might have my unit patch and US flag sewn on for extra cool guy points, but as is, its a cool piece of gear.",B00026LI4O
Nice and warm. Exactly what I was looking for,B00026LI4O
"I read all the reviews that said this runs large, so I bought a size XS (I would normally wear a medium). It fit okay everywhere, except that when the made it a size down, the only made the sleeves *shorter* not more narrow. So the sleeves are the right length, but insanely baggy.

Unless you are some kind of military wizard, don't buy this jacket if you are a size medium (I am 5'10"" and 155 lbs) or smaller.",B00026LI4O
the quality is very good. But the real size is bigger than the size chat I checked on Amanzon,B00026LI4O
"A bit too big but that was my own fault, though it wasn't my size im still happy with it.",B00026LI4O
A really good coat. Comes with liner and all. It could use more pockets. What you see is what you get for pockets. Besides that im impressed. I bought and use as a tribute to the vets of Vietnam and all those that wore olive drabe green. Heroes all.,B00026LI4O
"First, I'll say I like the jacket, it is what I wanted, style and feature-wise.  However, I'm returning it, due to reviews that said ""order a size smaller for a better fit"". That didn't work out too well for me.  Usually, I get a 'Large', this time I ordered a 'Medium'. (BTW, I'm 6'1"", 180, a 42"" chest, and arms are 37"")  Should have (will) ordered the Large size.  With the liner in place, it's pretty snug, more so than I find comfortable for me.  I like having a somewhat looser fit for better freedom of motion when active.  It does seem to be well made, no quibble there.  I am somewhat disappointed with the pockets.  I think they could be larger, especially the lower front pockets.  Those I would prefer in a 'bellows' style.  Color looks good, and I'd hope that, over time, it would develop that duller 'faded' look.
Hood is in place in such a way that it does not make the collar bulky, i.e., like a thick roll.  That's something I find objectionable on jackets with the hood stuffed right inside the collar.",B00026LI4O
Very nice jacket and comfortable to wear. I bought this to wear for the desert. It gets cold early in the morning but this jacket really helps me stay warm. I'm very satisfied with the jacket.,B00026LI4O
"Jacket arrived at an acceptable time frame, it fits perfectly.",B00026LI4O
Rothco now sells Chinese made - US Military jackets. Don't buy it.,B00026LI4O
"A stray stitch in the left sleeve made it difficult to put on the jacket the first time. On closer inspection, the stray stitch was not connected to any seam and once this stitch was cut, the jacket fit as advertised.",B00026LI4O
"Really nice jacket, but sleeves too long. I wear the large size and it fit great except for the sleeves. Had to have them altered.",B00026LI4O
Good jacket with liner.  Similar to the surplus jacket I wore in the 80s.,B00026LI4O
Looks good and fits well. Thanks for a great product,B00026LI4O
"This jacket goes with everything! Throw it over a tee and jeans for a quick errand run, or date night at a swank bar. I even wore it with a Boba Fett helmet during Halloweeen. It's well made too, probably going to be in my wardrobe for decades. Especially with the removable liner, it's the the most versatile jacket for the calendar year.

Once you get that sizing figured out, you'll wonder why you didn't have a jacket like this sooner. I'm 5'9"" and weigh 175 lbs (athletic build) and took a chance on an X-Small. I usually wear Medium in everything else with a 32-inch waist, and this jacket in X-Small still has plenty of room for layering, even with the liner in it.",B00026LI4O
"Although the stitching could be better, the jacket is great for the price. Make sure to size down as it does run big.",B00026LI4O
"Excellent jacket. All time, all weather.",B00026LI4O
"I'm 26/Male/6'/190lbs with broad shoulders, and the small was just a little too restrictive around the shoulders with the liner in. It fits well with the liner removed, but the liner itself is pretty thin (probably wouldn't wear this coat at all if it were anywhere below freezing out), so I don't really see myself wearing the coat much without it. Opted for the medium because I feel like I'll get so annoyed with the restricted arm movement that I would just never wear the small. Hood is a single, thin piece of canvas. No side pockets for your hands. Other than that the coat looks really nice and seems well made.",B00026LI4O
Sizes are misleading. I ordered an xs and it was more like a medium compared to carhartt or Walls.,B00026LI4O
I LOVE this jacket. Sleeves are actually long enough. Would have liked a tall size though.,B00026LI4O
GREAT MATERIAL I AM SURE IT WILL LAST,B00026LI4O
"Great jacket! I normally wear between a large or an extra large. So I ordered large. Way too big! I returned it, without a problem, and ordered the medium. Fit fine. Definitely not too big. I'm 6'0 and 175-180.",B00026LI4O
This jacket is great! Very tough and looks really good!,B00026LI4O
"Military wear for more than half a century has velcro now.  Dylan, De Niro and Marley all wore them.",B00026LI4O
I love this jacket. Very comfortable and unique.,B00026LI4O
This jacket reminded me of my active duty military days.  I love it!,B00026LI4O
"Doesn't get better then this, except to join the Army and get it free <):-)",B00026LI4O
"Overall this is a very good jacket. It's fairly warm even without the liner attached, and seems to repel wind fairly well. The hood is concealed in a zippered pocket underneath the back of the collar. The only notable downside I have encountered is that the hood can sometimes bunch up weirdly when it is concealed in the pocket, making it slightly uncomfortable on the upper back. However the hood can actually be detached and removed just like the liner, so this issue is easy to fix. The amount of storage space is very good, much more than you would get with most jackets. Construction quality also seems very good, but I have not had it for very long so only time will tell how well it holds up. Also looks very cool, would definitely recommend.

One final note, take the sizing recommendations seriously, these jackets do run quite large. I am 6' tall, 170 pounds, normally wear a large for shirts/jackets, but for this jacket an extra small (yes, EXTRA small) fits well with room to layer even with the liner attached.",B00026LI4O
Lots of mistakes in sewing. Inside underlay bottons in wrong spots resulting in a crooked look. Both sleves and neck velcros in wrong spots. Poor quality control on finished product. Material seems to be OK.,B00026LI4O
M-65. What can I say? Other than pay attention to the sizing! They run large!!!,B00026LI4O
"The jacket fits a little larger than expected, but does what it was meant to do.",B00026LI4O
Great jacket different material than the soft shell...go this one for my son..it is a larger size than normal so go down a size...sleeves on this one are good,B00026LI4O
"Unfortunately, the snaps on the coat wore through the material in a month's time, at which point it was too late to return the product. Since it didn't last though the first winter, we will not recommend anyone else buy this product.",B00026LI4O
Little to big for me had to. Get it for my son need to get a new one !!,B00026LI4O
"After reading quite a few reviews I went smaller than I thought I would need and I'm glad I did.  I'm not a big guy, 5'7"" but fit.  The X-SMALL fits great.  The liner is awesome.  I have enough room to fit a hooded, zip up sweatshirt underneath on the really cold days and I still have plenty of mobility.  Even without the sweatshirt this jacket is plenty warm and very comfortable.  The Velcro at the end of the sleeves is not the best.  It doesn't hold it's shape all that well but it's certainly not a deal breaker.  The material out of the box was pretty stiff so I separated the jacket and the liner and threw them in the wash on delicate. I also through them in the dryer on delicate as well.  (I do not own a fancy washer and dryer).  Came out great.  Some may argue with my decision to do that but I wasn't all that concerned about damaging the fabric or its finish.  Zipper is not YKK but is sturdy and dependable.  Pockets are good.  All in all for the price this is a great jacket and I have no regrets.",B00026LI4O
"This is a very well made, GREAT piece of gear.  HOWEVER...all the reviews are right: this thing is ENORMOUS for its size.  I am tall and slender (6'1"", 175 lbs, about a 40"" chest).  I usually think ""large"" because of the length of my torso and arms and the breadth of my shoulders.  Because of the previous buyers' reviews, I ordered a ""medium.""  Now that I've received it and tried it on, I almost think I could've gone with ""small,"" which is strange for a dude my size.

I have been in the Army for 25+ years.  When I was 18, I was issued the woodland camouflage pattern (BDU) cotton field jacket.  They gave me a medium.  It is WAYYYYYYYYY smaller than this Rothco jacket. I think what people have to realize is that this thing is basically a parka, which means it is designed to go over a complete uniform (t-shirt, fatigue coat, and possibly wool sweater and scarf), it is designed to hang much lower on your body, and it has a waist cinch cord (vastly different from the BDU field jacket).

Listen to the reviews: this is a great jacket at a great price, but it's HUGE for the sizing.  This is exactly the opposite of Rothco's modern ACU fleece jacket, which is TINY for its sizing (I own one of those, too).  Rothco is a great, time-tested and honored manufacturer.  I like their gear and their prices.",B00026LI4O
The zipper was a large bright shiny brass ugly thing.,B00026LI4O
"I am revising my previous review of this item, because, since actually wearing it for a lengthy period it appears to be much better than I originally thought.  I would recommend this item for purchase to former Viet Nam Era Vets who remember the quality of their issue!  Thanks Amazon for making this available to many who loved their original GI garments!",B00026LI4O
"I am very fond of this field jacket, it's well made and is very warm when the liner is attached. I use it everyday when it's cold. It's a great deal for the price. The authentic ones are more expensive and this one looks nice and does what I want in a jacket which is to keep me warm.",B00026LI4O
Jacket appears to be as advertised and fits well.,B00026LI4O
"Great jacket, well made, warm. I find the jacket runs a size bigger. Good looking.",B00026LI4O
Runs a little small but still nice,B00026LI4O
"6'1"" 170lbs. I got the large at first because a large is usually my size, but for this I had to size down. Medium fits comfortably and the only thing I'd complain about is the lack of pockets, but I don't really know if that's justified anyway.",B00026LI4O
sizing is a tad bigger than what it says but it's perfect nonetheless :-),B00026LI4O
"Great jacket, would buy again and recommend to a friend.
Size right on",B00026LI4O
"I'm so glad I heeded the warnings about size.  I usually wear a medium in clothing. I'm 5'9-1/2"" tall 150 lbs Not skinny, but lean, and the X-small fit perfectly.  Love the durability of the jacket, and the feeling that you really have something on in the cold.  I've always wanted a jacket in this military style, and this one really worked out.  It's got a really warm liner, and what I did this past winter when it was like -20 out most of the time, I just put on a long sleeve T and then a thin but good fleece on underneath. _ Even when it was like -40 out with the wind chill here in Chicago, I was totally fine.  Really great jacket.  I'm sure this will last a long time too.",B00026LI4O
"This jacket is great , just like the one I use to wear in the military. It is really warm especially with the liner in (yes it comes with the liner). I will only get to wear it on the coldest days , which will be a while (I live in fla.) I am glad I took thee advice of others about the jackets being large , I usually wear 2x in a jacket I am 6'3"" and weigh 245 and not fat . I bought the 1x and it is plenty big. VERY NICE JACKET FOR THE PRICE ! Very heavy and well made with sturdy zipper.",B00026LI4O
"I'm old enough to remember when the ""pickle suit"" was standard  issue. Fits nice.",B00026LI4O
Great jacket and a perfect fit...,B00026LI4O
"As its summer time, I haven't really worn it.  However it fits fine, and looks good.",B00026LI4O
My husband LOVED this coat!  Looks nice & is very warm & fits great!,B00026LI4O
"First, follow the sizing advice given here. I'm 6'2"" and 190 lbs and I ordered a small-regular. It fits me perfectly after a wash.

This jacket comes with a liner. The liner is quilted and together the jacket is very warm. I used it as a winter  coat in Wisconsin and I was good to -25 f this winter.

Without the liner it becomes a spring weight jacket.

I love this jacket, I think it is stylish. I love the pockets and the built in hood has made unexpected spring rain bearable.",B00026LI4O
"After reading comments that this jacket is big, I took the advise of many and bought a size smaller than I normally would.  That was a mistake.  Not so tight that I cannot wear it but too tight to wear a sweater under.  I simply wish that it was larger.",B00026LI4O
"I don't believe I have ever said that ""I love this jacket!"" before, but I really do!  The price is excellent, and the quality is high.  (When I first received the jacket, I scrutinized it thoroughly, looking at the zipper, every snap, button, and seam - there were absolutely no flaws.)  With the liner in, it is very warm.  I have yet to feel cold or chilled in 10 degree weather while wearing just a T-shirt underneath.

Note on sizing:  I agree with several of the comment/reviews that this jacket RUNS BIG.  I am 5'10"", 230 pounds, 38"" waist, 46"" chest.  With jackets, I'm between Large and XL.  According to the Rothco Size Chart, the chest measurement range for XL is 45""-49"".  I originally ordered the XL because I like to wear a heavy wool shirt and have ""room to move"".  The XL was fine in the arms/shoulders, but too big in the waist.  I returned it and ordered the Large - the fit is perfect!  With the liner in, I can wear a T-shirt and flannel shirt, and shovel snow without the jacket feeling like it is going to pull apart.

When my 23-year old son saw my jacket, he wanted one (in black)!  The Medium fits him perfect (he's around 170 pounds, 40"" chest).  I'd say he really likes his jacket as much as I like mine because whenever I see him, he's wearing it!",B00026LI4O
"When I bought this jacket two months ago I was lead to believe on the Amazon page that it was made in Holland so that, and the picture of a man wearing it, lead me to believe that it would be of solid quality.  This however was not the case.  What I received was made in China and the look and feel of the item made me feel like I paid $70 for a $45 product.  The fabric is not thick but feels flimsy, especially the decorative flaps of cloth on the top of each shoulder which detach from their buttons when removing a back pack.  The zipper on the front does not move smoothly and feels like it will wear out in less than three years time.  The OD green color of the fabric also doesn't look to be the color I was used to when I was in the Army in the mid '70s (it is too dark and, in my opinion, ugly).  It is possible, since I ordered a 2Xs extra-large size that only these larger jackets are made in China, but based on my experience I would not recommend this product to a friend.",B00026LI4O
"This has served me well so far this winter, and we've had some cold days. It's a sturdy winter jacket, especially for the price. Not the most stylish thing in the world, but who cares -- it keeps me warm!",B00026LI4O
"I know that this item have mixed reviews and other things, but for me was great and in the cold climate can keep you warm, i had to remove the inside part, still you can put it back with the integrated buttons that have inside. Lovely Purchase",B00026LI4O
"Once it gets washed to get the stiffness out of it, it will be like a second skin.  It is the same thing that Uncle Sam gave.",B00026LI4O
Great jacket for the price. Get a size smaller then you wear normally. It really keeps you warm and blocks the wind.,B00026LI4O
"Terrible jacket design, sloppy and not well made.
Feels like wearing a cement bag ...
Do not recommend this product!",B00026LI4O
"I ordered size XL (5'9"", 210 lbs). The coat fit me as expected. There is a quilted detachable liner inside and, so as to add some shape, there is a waist tie so you can draw it in a little at the waist. I tied these off at their respective holes so the coat consistently has shape whether open or closed. Inside the collar is a hood which I haven't used yet. The coat feels well made and looks good open or closed. Buying the size XL, leaves me enough room under the coat for multiple casual layers or multiple ""keep warm"" layers.

Overall: I'm very happy with my purchase and I would buy this again.",B00026LI4O
"Yeah, I'm gonna tell you right off....I did heed the warnings on size and ordered a size down from what I should ideally get.
Its still too big, really!  But that's ok, because I got this for use as my prinitive hike in/camp jacket, so I wanted the option
of adding a lot of layers without feeling like a star fish.

Its very warm.....unless you are in extremely cold temps....you probably won't need a lot of layering underneath this.

If its too warm, you can pull out the liner.

Very rugged to!

I don't think you can go wrong here, for the price.",B00026LI4O
"It's a decent reproduction for the money. Doesn't seem quite as heavy as the M1965 I was issued back in the mid seventies but not bad at all. I'm 6' 1"" 150 lbs with long arms and usually wear a large but ordered a medium per other reviews about these running on the large side, it fits me perfectly. Needs an extra piece of velcro on the cuff. . The quilted liner isn't the same or as heavy as the one I had for my original which was made from some sort of heavy cream colored terrycloth like material covered with green nylon material on the outside. No big deal as I prefer layering anyway but I'm looking around for one of those old heavy liners. All and all I'm quite satisfied with the jacket.",B00026LI4O
"Listen to the reviews sizing advice! I am 5' 9"", 170lbs and am a prototype Medium build - I ended up with an X-Small (and still roomy).  Great jacket. Exactly what I was looking for. Seems well made and very much authentic looking.",B00026LI4O
"I spent a lot of time in these field jackets in the 24 years I was in the military, I always found them to be a comfortable jacket that would keep you warm in cold weather and would take the abuse that was part of getting the job done. This jacket seems to be just as good as the ones I was issued in the Army. I'm sure it will keep me warm when I'm out trying to photograph wild birds this winter.",B00026LI4O
Bought it for my brother who works outdoors in winter. Jacket is very warm and very nice looking. Would recommend.,B00026LI4O
"This a heavy duty jacket for foul weather, with or without a full equally heavy duty liner! Will be very good to have on to walk the dog  or do chores out side on those stormy days.",B00026LI4O
"Seems a bit light ,, material is ok liner is ok . Try 9it out next winter if it gets cold enough for it.  Only thing i did not like that it was made in China. That cant be helped.not your fault..",B00026LI4O
"I have worn this jacket for a while now, and I can say I love it. I am 6' tall, weigh 210-lbs, slender build with upper pecs. I ordered a large size, KL on the tag. Made in Holland.
The jacket fits like a glove, form fitted a little bit. I have adorned it with my 82nd Airbore patches, Sergeant Stripes and all. It is not the regular American style though. But that is alright by me. I feel cool as cucumber in this number. I would definitely promote this Jacket.
My ""hard core"" battle buddies like it too.",B00026LI4O
the size is off so i returned it like three weeks ago still no word about refund . but jacket seems to be a decent product.be prepared for long return wait,B00026LI4O
So there is a sizing issue as may others have stated. I read the reviews and ordered a x-small. I was apprehensive to say the least but... I am 5'8'' 175 with a muscular build and it fits perfectly!,B00026LI4O
"Best flippin jacket I have bought. Keeps me warm & dry. I just wish I had inside pockets, but who cares... I am warm!!",B00026LI4O
I brought this coat for my husband and so far I have worn it the most..( When he is away) I will be buying one for myself next Winter In the right size... It has saved me with the cold this winter.,B00026LI4O
"except for the wierd cuff thing on the sleeves my husband loves it. he just did some alterations and fixed it since we didn't know
what the wierd stuff was for.",B00026LI4O
I love this coat.  It is warm and I love the fit and feel of it.  It comes with a liner so you will not be cold in this.,B00026LI4O
"Nice jacket, very bad sizing.
I'm 6' 225 pounds, I ordered a Medium and it fits BIG.
Be careful when you order.",B00026LI4O
"The real deal. Wore one when riding my motorcycle in Europe during the winter. Field jacket, liner, and undersweater.  28 degrees and still comfortable. Great investment.",B00026LI4O
It was a gift for my son.  He put it on and it was a true fit.  It was sent exactly when it was promised.  I would say it was a success.,B00026LI4O
I am a Marine veteran and Vietnam vet.  I cannot tell the difference between this Jacket and of the military issue I wore back in 1967-1971. It arrived actually several days ahead of time and I love it.  I did as advised and ordered a size smaller than my normal size and it fits perfectly.,B00026LI4O
"This is a great coat for a great price! I am 6' 1"" and weight 175 lbs. I ordered the X-Small and it fit perfectly.",B00026LI4O
"Just what I was looking for a tough, well made field jacket. 2x exlarge is right for most guys after you have it shrunk. I'm going to get the sleeves altered as they are a little long for me.

Good product",B00026LI4O
"My son was interested in my 20 year old Military jacket, so I gave it to him.  I soon missed wearing my old jacket, this one is even better.  The inner removable lining is a nice plus.  During this past winter, I was kept very warm as I was loading wood into my outside wood burning stove.",B00026LI4O
"I love this thing. I only wish I had ordered a size smaller. Other than that its great. The zipper is heavy duty, it feels like it will last forever. The liner is removable, which is good in the spring. Overall great product.",B00026LI4O
"Great price and well built coat.  Get many compliments that this is a fashion jacket, not an M65.  Read notes on sizing carefully - you will be happy if you stick to the advice in the tables and reviews as this is nonstandard siaing.",B00026LI4O
"Nice almost like my original issued, the only problem with it is the Velcro on the left sleeve is no good keeps letting cuff open other then that nice coat. For those that think the openings at the wrist are to big that's the way they are suppose to be. This is a combat jacket not a fashion jacket.",B00026LI4O
Its a decent replica of the real thing. My last M65 was a size large bought in 1990 thats still going strong except I had grown beyond the ability to button it closed. Others are making this GI design but I think Rothco offers the best value in replicas. New GI jackets are a rare species today.,B00026LI4O
"My first fatigue jacket was Korean War issue, and it lasted over twenty years.  My last one camouflage, and it last 30 years of trekking and surveying in the brush.  I am a connoisseur of sorts.

This jacket is ideal.  I got a large/regular which fit perfectly (I am 6'2'' and 203 pounds).  It is comfortable with plenty of freedom for arm and shoulder movement with the lining in place.  I live and play in the high deserts and mountains of Nevada and Utah.  I normally wear mine without the supplied lining, which leaves room for a vest, etc. -- as well as the looseness I desire when carrying a pistol.",B00026LI4O
"I have had this for a few months now in the dead of winter Ohio. Very durable, very warm. It is a great coat.",B00026LI4O
Very happy with my purchase fit just like it should. The coat liner doesn't seam to be as warm as the original ones but it does the job.,B00026LI4O
It well differently keep me warm while camping.,B00026LI4O
This M-65 is really nicer than others that I have worn. Highly recommend it!,B00026LI4O
"Excellent quality, just like the one The Air Force issued me. They do run large though.",B00026LIA8
"I bought it to use when working as an EMT.  I have a camo one since 1993 that is in great shape and this was my first choice.  Functional and perfect to when I'm ""on duty"".",B00026LIA8
"Sizes are HUGE....I got an XS and I'm 6'0"", 150 lbs...the zipper doesn't zip full length, the cuffs are strange, too bad it's not exactly like the original army field jackets, wish it had slash front pockets, snaps are pretty stiff, liner could use a bit of tailoring for a better look/fit ...but it is warm, durable, excellent for an all around go to jacket, and if you shop around you can probably get a good deal. Overall a decent value.",B00026LIA8
"I love this field jacket, it has good looks, wears well, has good weight and is very well made. It should last a long time.",B00026LIA8
I purchase this for my deployment with the medical team.  It shields me well in this year cold chilly winds.  It even has a hood that is hidden in the collar. Recommended.,B00026LIA8
"I have a 44 chest. 33"" sleeve and am 5'6"". A large is listed as my size, and that's what size I ordered but knuckle-dragging Sumo Wrestler could fit in it. The chest is about a 50"", the sleeves are about 45"". What in the heck am I going to do with this?",B00026LI6W
I bought this jacket for the PA state police academy.  It fits well and is well made.  The liner is easy to remove and install.  Very warm also.  Highly recommend.,B00026LI6W
I have had a similar jacket for close to thirty years.  This new jacket seems to be of the same quality as the old one.  I hope I last another years.,B00026LI6W
jacket was great. just as described. very heavy duty. its usually hard for me to to find jackets that have sleeves long enough for my arms as my size is xxl tall but these were perfect. the colors aren't as faded as the jacket in the picture either. i can see wearing this jacket for years and years to come without having any problems with it.,B00026LI6W
qualtity of the jacket is great.  sizing is as stated on the measurement chart.,B00026LI6W
Lost a lot of weight lately. The new one fits perfectly.,B00026LI6W
"This is a very nice Jacket/coat. It is a little larger than I expected. I read to order the next smaller size than you normally wear, and I usually wear everything in XL because I am wide across the shoulders. I am 5' 10"" and 207 lbs. I ordered a large. The jacket fit well with the exception of the arm lengths, which were about 6"" to long, and while it has Velcro clasps to tighten at the wrist, even with them pulled all the way in they were still loose and I most likely will have to roll them up a little to get a more comfortable fit. I like the fact that its a complete jacket, meaning it has the liner included, and heavy duty hardware throughout.",B00026LI6W
Great hunting coat and perfect for wearing layers. Got it fast and the fit was great.,B00026LI6W
bought this for my husband and he LOVED it!!!!,B00026LI6W
Just what my Sea Cadet needed.  thanks,B00026LI6W
It was the perfect fit. A nice jacket for the price.,B00026LI6W
"CAMOUFLAGE M-65 FIELD JACKET, fits great and is perfect in every way! Found one at a garage sale from a retired vet, was a tad small but rugged. This one is looks exactly like those used out in the feild.",B00026LI6W
"Awesome jacket just like I had back in the day.
Heavy duty jacket.",B00026LI6W
"I admit that I tried to save a few bucks and get a ""knock off"" M-65 jacket to replace my original jacket that was 30+ years old.  As soon as I put it on, I knew it wasn't the same.  The pockets are not as deep as the original and the jacket is not very water repellent.  The real kicker is that if you use the hood in the rain, you will quickly get soaked.  The rain flap is poorly designed and is about 25% shorter than my original jacket.  So instead of allowing the water to run over your neck and off the jacket, it funnels the water down your back.  That just sucks.  From this point on, I'll avoid any product made my Rothco.  The Chinese make it cheap, but in the long run, it wasn't worth the price...",B00026LI6W
"This ""jacket"" is an insult to the M65.  All I did was pull on the jacket ends unsnap the buttons, and wound up ripping the button right out of the jacket.  It seems its made out of the crappiest of Chinese polymers.

I wore the M65 in the USMC, for 4 years.  This is a complete POS not only in comparison, but on an absolute scale",B00026LI6W
"Awesome, very good quality, not as faded as pictured (great for me because I don't like ""vintage"" style). Very loose jacket so if you prefer the ""fashion"" way order one or two size down.",B00026LI6W
This is a very nice jacket and the selling features were the removable lining and the detachable hood which can be hidden.,B00026LI6W
Love everything about field jacket except arm cuffs.  Cant seem to keep the cuffs at correct lengths. Good coat.,B00026LI6W
Just what I needed; okay size fit is not dead on go one size up and the cuff need more velcro strip to shorten them up..,B00026LI6W
Really like this jacket. It is well made and arrived on time. Really happy with it. Couldn't ask for more.,B00026LHNQ
"Bought this for my 80 year old dad and he loves it. Nice heavy, well made jacket. Very eye catching.",B00026LHNQ
"Amazing product sturdy and very warm.  Love the bright logo on the back, my hub loves to wear it when it gets cold.",B00026LHNQ
"This jacket will keep you warm, it is not a flimsy wind breaker. Very surprised in the quality for the price I paid. And it looks just right to me.
Perfect.",B00026LHNQ
The coat is warm.  prefer to purchase items made in America.,B00026LHNQ
"Great Jacket, beautiful and fits perfectly. Would recommend to any and all Marines.",B00026LHNQ
"I bought this for my husband, and it fit him perfectly! He loves it! :)",B00026LHNQ
Great looking jacket. Very proud to wear it and get many complements on it. People want to know where I got it.,B00026LHNQ
Nice Jacket. Bought it for my dad. Fits well . Looks good.,B00026LHNQ
We brought this for my father in law since he is a Marine. It is a great flight jacket & has a lot of great features!,B00026LHNQ
"These shorts are very cute, but quite short.  Maybe that's what the ""scuba"" part means!  They are good quality.  My daughte is quite tall, so I know they won't fit her next year, but were suitable for one summer.",B00027CAQS
"I ordered Med waist because that's what I wear in most other brand BDUs, but these were a little snug. I then ordered the large which were a little big but acceptable.",B00027FWM2
material doesn't last but comfortable for the six months to a year,B00027FWM2
"I ordered a medium, it was wayyy too large. Big waist and length wise, can't wear it all. Will be returning.",B00027FWM2
bought these for halloween so its all good but they're baggy and extremely long. Hemming them right now because im awesome,B00027FWM2
Measurement was way off. It was huge on my husband. Too long and too wide.,B00027FWM2
"Always have loved these pants, BDU's are perfect for working gear.",B00027FWM2
I love camo pants and there shorts.  Due to a nerve disease I can't wear jeans,B00027FWM2
"The material, pattern and construction seem durable and rugged.  The fit is as expected and the pants are comfortable.  These are the first camouflage pants I've ever owned and I needed them for a week long camp so I'm getting used to the ""camp print"" fashion statement.",B00027FWM2
Love this camo pattern. The shirt is comfortable and plenty of pockets. I know the fabric is strong enough to go through a breyer thicket with out any issues because I have done it. The size is on target. I would recommend.,B00027FWJA
I like the fabric n color. Perfect fit for my boyfriend!!,B00027FWJA
Feels good. Great sturdy fabric. Im 150lbs and 6ft. Got a medium long and it fit great. Not tight but not super loose. Would purchase again.,B00027FWJA
"Very good bdu shirt, high quality at a reasonable price.",B00027FWJA
"I bought a large because I wear a large in Rothco pants.  The arms and overall length of the shirts are very short. The width is more than I need. I think going up a size (which would mean a return) would just get me a bigger overall size with the same short sleeve and overall length problem. I guess I will either give this away and order from a different company. Quality shirt, just oddly sized.",B00027FWJA
Too large for body and sleeves are too short. Sending back.,B00027FWJA
"Excellent product, excellent seller",B00027FWJA
Beautiful coloring and great quality. Love it totaly,B00027FWJA
GREAT PRODUCT GREAT COLOR PATTERN ALL IS WELL.....,B00027FWJA
I do like the shirt.fits very well.just order one size biger.,B00027FWJA
It worked out perfect for what I wanted! A simmunitions cover shirt!,B00027FWJA
"Good quality BDU shirt in Woodland Camo print. Offers great concealment for hunting in spring, summer, and early fall. Looks just like the military issued shirt. I'm 5' 9"" 160 Lbs.  I got mine in medium and it fits perfect. Highly recommend it.",B00027FWJA
"Good quality,  fits perfectly.  Awesome addition to hunting wear.",B00027FWJA
"I like this top, the material is a little on the light side compared to the average bdu. But, it does work to my advantage in the summer heat. As of now it's been holding up, I'm not wearing it during war but I've beaten it around on a private range rolling around in the dirt.",B00027FWJA
Fit my husband perfectly. Good quality!,B00027FWJA
The shirt I received looks NOTHING like the one in the photo. The one I got is very dark.,B00027FWJA
Very happy with product and fit.,B00027FWJA
"A great, rugged shirt! After reading the reviews about the sizing concerns, here is my line: I am 6.2', 175 lbs., 42"" chest, and normally wear a ""Large"" in shirts. I ordered a ""Medium"" and it fits perfectly, including proper sleeve length. I intend to wear this alone as a shirt, occasionally with a t-shirt underneath. If I were to wear this over another regular shirt, it would be too tight in the chest. Material is durable and well-stitched; quite stiff until broken in. Nice, roomy pockets. Tiger stripe camo pattern perfectly matches a pair of my BDU pants from the late 1970s. The button tabs at 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock on back work well; without them, the shirt would have very ample room for those with a larger mid-section. Overall, I am pleased with the product, and look forward to wearing it a good bit in the great SC outdoors! Hope the attached photos prove to be helpful.",B00027FWJA
"The arms were a bit too wide, so I had it taken in. Other than that I love it!",B00027FWJA
"Was looking at pants and it said these jacket go with them, when they arrived the material and look was different.  I can only blame myself for not looking at the description and taking the websites word for it.",B00027FWJA
"The durability alone will make you buy this shirt. I love BDU's , as I was for many years doing security and our uniforms were as such. Moreover in my non work life, this type of shirt is very comfortable, useful and great looking. In cooler weather can be used as an extra layer almost like a jacket. The shirt has big pockets that are great if you don't want to carry items in your hands or pants pockets. Pair this shirt up with the same brand BDU pants and you have a look that is not only functional but can also fit in many situations. Use this for everyday knock around shirt, for fishing, camping and of course if you do security it's a winner. The price is right for this versatile shirt. Buy true to your size. It suppose to be big almost like a jacket but it is a shirt. For the price this is a steal. Buy a few today!",B00027FWJA
"Great material and look. I would recommend size small for 5'3"" 130lbs.",B00027FWJA
Very well made. Military spec. Will buy again. Good value.,B00027FWJA
Good shirt held its color and was awesome,B00027FWJA
"Kinda small, bought a medium, should of bought a large, the fit is not the best",B00027FWJA
"I honestly figured this would be a little bit larger than listed, judging by the feedback. I wear a 2x faithfully and ordered as such, with plans to dryer shrink it. Let me tell you, I dried this for 2 hours and it's still a true 4x shirt. It's like a black moo moo or night gown. Great material, so great they could've made me two shirts out of t!",B00027FWJA
"Great price, a bit large, seems solid so far and makes me feel super ready to join my local militia.",B00027FWJA
Well made shirt that does run about a size too large.  Husband loves it!,B00027FWJA
"I'm 5'4 and purchased a size small, love the fit and style. Very Kim K-esque!",B00027FWJA
great vietnam era pattern he needed for costume,B00027FWJA
Bought this for a water survival class and wore it in a pool for a week.  Fit was okay but it was pretty short.  somehow I got a maternity version that has buttons with an expander on the sides.  Color is slightly different than other brands so get the same brand top/bottom if it's important,B00027FWJA
fits good and is exactly what I wanted,B00027FWJA
"Looks really good, pretty nice quality other than a few misplaced stitches, also it came really early and way ahead of schedule, but make sure to order 1 size smaller than you are, its pretty big, for example I'm medium so i ordered a small.",B00027FWJA
This is a nice heavy weight pull over,B00027FWJA
I love this shirt!!! It's thick enough to be worn as a light jacket which is how I wore it. I wanted it to be slightly oversized so I ordered a xl. Normally in mens I wear a medium or a large.,B00027FWJA
"I bought this for my dad as a gift after his previous BDU shirt wore out after several years of regular wear. It runs a little large; it would be ideal if Tall sizes were available, then I would have gone a size down. Construction is solid. The pockets held up from regular use as well. I would recommend this for veterans or anybody interested in BDUs.",B00027FWJA
"Good for the price, mine came running large but ok",B00027FWJA
"This shirt is definitely high quality. I expect to get many years of use out of it and paired with the Rothco BDU pants you get an affordable, durable hunting camo solution...",B00027FWJA
"Solid design. Good stitiching. Thick and durable material. I have not washed it yet so I cannot comment on fading characteristics yet.

One of the best materials of any BDU blouse I have ever owned.",B00027FWJA
To big in the shoulders. Fits and feels more like a light jacket than  a shirt. There needs to be a lot more clarification on what the actual standard short sizes are for these types of products. A way to convert the listed military sizes to a civilian equivilent,B00027FWJA
"It is very similar to a safari jacket I had several years ago, which was lost, however at a much lower price. I used it to travel, and all those pockets come in handy for passport, boarding passe, etc. Good workmanship and fits nicely over a regular shirt.",B00027FWJA
"I loved it, although bit big for a medium that I got?, but still very cool- although it's definitely could pass for a light jacket more than a typically expected shirt- pocketd at the torso helps for feeling this way as well. very cool looking",B00027FWJA
"Heavy made, good fit and carry's load well in pockets.",B00027FWJA
"Good color and comfort, but sizing is strange. Extremely short waisted and wide, but with incredibly long sleeves. Runs very large in general.",B00027FWJA
Love the style and the way it's made !,B00027FWJA
Very rugged very thick nice shirt only 4 stars cuz not usd to cargo shirt,B00027FWJA
"Runs a little big, had to go to a Large.",B00027FWJA
"I picked this up for use with a costume and it served its purpose quite well.  I went with khaki as I going for a sort of steampunk safari guy look but didn't want to spend $70 to $200 on an actual safari jacket (nice though those are).  In order to make it work, however, I needed to modify things slightly.  I painted the buttons and glued some decorative gears on them (thin flat gears so as to still be able to use the buttons), I did the same for the adjustment buttons along the sides and the cuff buttons.  Additionally, as the buttons are hidden and I wanted the appearance of buttons down the front at least I sewed some of these same gears (built up a bit to look more like buttons) on along the button line.  Also added some other bits to make it work.

It worked quite well for cosplay, and from a practical standpoint I am sure it will hold up quite well.  The stitching is all well done and solid, there are spots where they could have perhaps been a little more careful to trim the thread off closer to the garment but that is just being nit picky.  Its at least as good as the other BDU uniform jackets I have and was a lower price.  I would heartily recommend this for either practical or costuming purposes.",B00027FWJA
Nice solid shirt. Tough fabric. It should last a long time.,B00027FWJA
"my son, who I bought it for loved it, he stands 6'5"" tall and said it fit just fine and was perfect.",B00027FWJA
"Looks as good as the one I had while I was in the military. Fit was a bit large, though. Make sure you check your sizes first! I believe the Large Regular would fit me better. the sleeves seem to run a bit longer than normal.",B00027FWJA
Sleeves are a bit long and wide but a great shirt/buy. Shirt length could be a little longer as well.,B00027FWJA
"I wear a size XL hoodie, I am 5'10"" 185lbs.  I ordered the Large because the chest size is slightly smaller than what I wear in a hoodie, well this thing arrived today and you could easily fit 2 of me in it.  It is like a rain poncho on me, and even though I have pretty long arms the sleeves go past my knuckles.  I just reordered a medium, i'm just hoping it's not too small because I haven't worn a size medium anything in almost 20 years...",B00027FWJA
"Are you kidding me? As a security contractor in the Middle East, these were complete excrement. The irony: the company wanted us to look professional but these uniforms are so cheap they fell apart quickly, we ended up looking absolutely UNprofessional. Buttons were coming off on DAY 1!! By the end of the week, most of our buttons had come off. They were too thick for the heat and too baggy to keep us warm. You couldn't tuck them in because it was too short even though the sleeves were longer. If you got it bigger to tuck in, your sleeves made you look like Merlin. It was like wearing dad's uniform when you were a kid. If you tried rolling them up, no cuff! Look at the picture closely. It's just a flap with a button hole and two buttons. Guess what, those buttons are useless too!! They didn't strap the sleeve down at all because they were too close. You mind as well left them open. The design is extremely outdated, no one uses the bottom pockets anymore because it was USELESS to begin with. Nothing against other countries, but the third world countries in Africa were given these on another contract. We walked around Afghanistan looking like janitors, interpreters, or TCN's (third country nationals).

We spent our own money to buy better tops. I don't know who rated these more stars, possibly people who didn't use them for laboring work or military work. If I could give it negative stars, I would. Spend the money. With these style clothing, you're paying for a name as well as quality. We ended up buying 5.11, Tru Spec, and Propper clothing to replace them.",B00027FWJA
"I live in Miami and live in a climate that is in a constant state of humidity/hot weather, but this BDU top has done right by me. It's light and very breathable, however I normally wear it unbuttoned. The material feels durable and has not torn or ripped on me yet. I have it run through about 4 laundry cycles and the color has not faded. I normally wear a size large BDU and ordered this one in the same size. While it runs the perfect length along my arms, it's very baggy around the waist area, giving a fat guy appearance. The BDU does have two buttons on the sides of the waist that can be used to adjust the tightness, but even after using those buttons, it still has a very baggy appearance. I have tried to shrink it a little by tossing it in the dryer after a wash, but it has not shrunk.

If not for the sizing issue, this would be a clear cut 5/5, but I have to deduct one point for the sizing issue.",B00027FWJA
"The product is ok, I order XL tall and got regular, it'll work.",B00027FWJA
"I just got a XXL Coyote Brown  BDU shirt in. I am 6'2 and 260 pounds. After washing and a medium heat dry the shirt is barely long enough, just as it  felt when I first got it. Ironically the sleeves are slightly too long. Most of the buttons were loosely sewn on and even with my size the shirt is too loose and baggy. The material quality seems decent enough and it is a decent looking shirt with plenty of pockets. Each pocket has two hidden buttons to hold them closed. I probably won't buy another because they don't come in tall sizes. Consider buying one size smaller than you normally wear, they are huge in the body...... Chris in Canada.",B00027FWJA
"A great product, arrived on time, and there have thus far have been no problems! I bought this jacket because I really liked how my grandfather's fit and I'm all about that -Tiger Camo - Its made of strong durable material and the reinforced elbows are actually thicker than the rest of the Jacket. I've used similar products for paintball and outdoor events, and they all held up well, I expect no less from this awesome shirt.",B00027FWJA
"Product arrived earlier than expected in a nice plastic bag to keep it dry and clean. Seams all appear to be well stitched and it looks exactly as pictured.

WARNING:  I got a 5X because I am a large dude and normally 4X is just ""okay"" fitting.  This 5X is big enough I'm comfortable wearing this shirt as a jacket over other clothing, but too large to wear as a ""shirt"" which was the plan.  I'm still very happy with the product and look forward to wearing this as a lightweight summer jacket (I always hate giving up my extra pockets from the other 3 seasons)",B00027FWJA
"Heavy duty,need to wash couple times to loosen up.",B00027FWJA
"Great quality, good price very durable...",B00027FWJA
"IS HUGE. Large-regular ACU's used to fit slightly big on me because they run slightly bigger than size but damn, this thing fits me like a x-large regular ACU. Guess I got a new jacket!",B00027FWJA
nice shirt.. fits well... nice and thick... great protection against,B00027FWJA
clould have been longer but it'll do for hunting.,B00027FWJA
"Shirt does not seem to absorb sweat.  Not sure if treated for that option, but shirt seems to be slightly warm and sweat does not appear to be absorbed.  I only washed twice so this may disappear after additional washings.",B00027FWJA
Perfect and exactly as described.,B00027FWJA
Exactly what I wanted and a perfect fit,B00027FWJA
"A lot of IPs and don't have spare buttons, seems more like a large than a medium. Not a real US standard BDU but it's good enough for airsoft players.",B00027FWJA
NOW IT'S DIFFERENT SIZE FROM 1970 IN S.E ASIA JUNGLE,B00027FWJA
It fits as expected and looks like the item in the pic. However the workmanship mainly the stitching whilst good was done only where the minimum of need was to hold it together. EG the button cover material is the shirt and the buttons were added on...but only stitched on the ends not the side. Apart from that it is pretty good and nothing a needle didn't fix.,B00027FWJA
Great shirt for outdoor use where its hot and humid (like Guam)! Happy with purchase:),B00027FWJA
Excellent jacket for heavy duty at woods and camping. Walked through woods trees and swamps and keeps as new.,B00027FWJA
"Sturdy product, well made, can wear over several layers, almost like a coat. Great price too, thanks :)",B00027FWJA
Very nice material but runs very wide. Will be returning for a smaller size.,B00027FWJA
"Good fit, excellent quality.  Very happy customer, thanks.",B00027FWJA
"Bought this for use as a Viet Cong uniform for a multi-day Mil-Sim airsoft event. It seems to be well put together and isn't too hot to wear, even in South Carolina heat.",B00027FWJA
I should have gotten the 3x that would have been fine. This product runs large. Very well made. Quite satisfied with the shirt.,B00027FWJA
Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for,B00027FWJA
Sizes run big. Perfect for layering underneath.,B00027FWJA
Great quality. I'm 215lb with slight belly and this fit perfect. Medium reg. was too tight. Large reg. fit the bill :),B00027FWJA
"This shirt is both too big and too small...very weird cut also is very light weight, I never had a shirt like this when I was in the Army.",B00027FWJA
"Doesn't appear to be ripstop, but a nice nonetheless.",B00027FWJA
Very good quality great woodland color can't beat the price.,B00027FWJA
"I'm a taller guy (6'1""), and the fact that these blouses do not come in Tall sizes is an issue.  If there is anyone who is over 5'10"" this blouse will be way too short.  If I had another 3-4 inches in length the blouse would be perfect.  The pants fit just right with no issues.",B00027FWJA
"these BDU's are fantastic but be careful what size you order. i ordered an xxl thinking that the size would be ideal for me but i should have ordered an xl instead. these things are really great to have and to wear for hunting,camping or for just all around daily use.",B00027FWJA
Fits perfect----it shrinks a little the first wash and that made it perfect. Great design for early fall hunting.,B00027FWJA
Fits great and is very comfortable! Will buy again.,B00027FWJA
"I bought this jacket to go along with my BDU pants . Tried it on and the jacket fits as it should fit for it being BDU's I am a US Navy veteran I have had to wear my share of BDUs in my life time so I know how they should fit take my word for it buy your size , if you wear medium buy medium or it will not fit . I also suggest if your going to buy the BDU pants with this to stick with the same manufacturer so the patterns match and the same material is used for both pants and jacket. Just some suggestions to make your experience with BDUs a lot better. This jacket is comfortable and durable I highly recommend this jacket .",B00027FWJA
These Vietnam era shirts are cut to the utilities of the time.,B00027FWJA
"I got a medium. Normally wear a large/XL and this is still big...I'm 6'-3"" and 175 lbs. I'm using this for a Mardi Gras Han Solo costume for the vest and will have to cut the sleeves and collar off. I am hoping that it will do the job.",B00027FWJA
Love it tested out in the cold weather even and its relativley warm plan to use it to display all the  rock and heavy metal band patches that I've collected over the years it's perfect just as I expected it to army surplus stores always charged 50 To 60 bucks for one but this was an incredible price buy it now,B00027FWJA
FITS GREAT WISH IT WAS 100% COTTON INSTEAD OF COTTON/POLY BLEND,B00027FWJA
Husband loved it for nature walks in the mountains. Plenty extra pockets and it being a little big worked well for him to wear over a TShirt.,B00027FWJA
"Shirt arrive ontime and fit true to size. I'm a bigger guy so the shirt is just a little short on me but not to the point where it looks ill-fitting, The sleeves are long which is great because I have long arms. Very nice BDU shirt.",B00027FWJA
"Love the shirt, for a BDU it fits just as expected",B00027FWJA
great bdu a lil big in size but you can adjust the side then you good,B00027FWJA
"This coat fits pretty good and it comes in whatever size you order maybe a little biggish in size but that's just how it happens. The only reason I rate it 4/5 is because in the image the camo is clearly a tan dominant fabric but the one I got happens to have a lot of the green as the main color and the desert sandy tan color is more of an accent to it but that is possibly just the luck of the draw but it doesn't bother me too much because I live in an area where that is good. But don't worry too much because it still is desert camo and will blend rather well its just a bit green if you look up close but it still will look tan at a distance and overall feels looks and wears good.
By the way if your on the fence about getting this due to mine being more of a green color than I wouldn't worry too much as I can barely tell the difference unless looking at it a bit. I just thought it would be something worth mentioning probably just a bit of nit picking",B00027FWJA
"Uf Bdu Shirt Tiger Stripe 3x fits a bit larger than expected. Other than that It is one great button up coat. Color is fantanstic, feels rugged enough to handle the outdoors. tried to shrink it but it didn't seem to shrink much...which is ok in my book!",B00027FWJA
I think size large fit me but it a bit to large for me.. I think size medieum will fit me better.  beside that the shirt look great.,B00027FWJA
65%poly35%cotton Rip-Stop looks graet and good quality :),B00027FWJA
Not the cloth I am use to in camies...a little stiff and noisey. Maybe after 10 or 20 washes they will relax.,B00027FWJA
"It's nothing like the high priced tactical stuff with Velcro bands for patches, but compared to others in it's price range it is more than acceptable.  Durable and held up to an entire summer out in the wilderness.",B00027FWJA
"i have a couple of these usually get them in a larger size and put a hhoded sweat jacket under them for spring and fall,but i also use them while hunting large strong pockets hold plenty of shells and other things",B00027FWJA
"sizes are a little on the larger side but not too much,nice shirt.",B00027FWJA
Great shirt! You will love it! It fits well and feels great!,B00027FWJA
"Great construction, I suggest ordering one size down because the product runs large. If you normally are a large in t-shirts, I suggest ordering a medium.",B00027FWJA
"I went along with the customer reviews and I have to say the product is a very pleasant surprise indeed. Quality of fabric and stitching are surprisingly good, especially given the price.

Looks like a very durable and long lasting product, as well as the 'cool' factor of the tiger stripe camo pattern. Will require a little 'breaking in' of use and a few wash cycles on account of stiffness when new but I attribute that mainly to the tough quality of the material. This jacket could comfortably pass for mil - spec, if it isn't already so. They run slightly larger than advertised but that's no issue for  me at all. Better a little too large than too small anyways, plus a bit more loose fitting can translate into more cool and comfortable wear when it's really hot and humid, as when outdoors in the woods hiking or hunting.

Overall a great product at a very fair price. I intend to get another one pretty soon.",B00027FWJA
Nice shirt but I had to return it because of the size.,B00027FWJA
"Wonderful if you like the style; a bit big so plan for use as jacket or
smaller size for shirt.",B00027FWJA
came in a timely manner; fit is good,B00027FWJA
"I needed an shirt with pockets to wear over my tee to cover my tactical bag. Works great, no hot.",B00027FWJA
"Wow! The colors are actually a shade brighter and not so dark. Just know if your trying to match it with regular rothco tiger bottoms, this top will look more evenly toned and not as dark as original rothco. And won't match together. This also came on time and fits perfect.",B00027FWJA
good got it before expected and very happy and satisfied definitely a good quality product of its kind for what is worth .,B00027FWJA
"I'm talking huge. I got a large, and probably should have gotten an infant sized one. I don't remember things being oversized when I was in the army. Maybe it is a mind game. Like this is one of the ways our over-bearing government makes us feel small. Oh man they probably do it with boots, too so that the men, you know, who equate foot size to hot dog length if ya catch my drift, would feel inadequate because they thing they're an 11 but The Man tells them they're an 8. This is probably why our military is so badass. It's a bunch of angry guys with a manufactured Napoleonic complex. Well done Uncle Sam! Brilliant! Five Stars for 'Merica!",B00027FWJA
"Good fit, well made, reasonably heavy fabric for the price, with a lot of storage pockets. I would recommend this purchase.",B00027FWJA
"The only thing missing from this is the so-called ""epaulettes"" usually present on the shoulders. I guess I must have overlooked that small detail. Apart from that this fits better than any other BDU I've had on before.",B00027FWJA
I like this BDU because it is durable and washable. if it feels too big there are buttons all over the BDU where you can tighten it. I'm about 5'6 and the medium was alittle large but i washed it and tightened it and it fits great now.,B00027FWJA
"This BDU shirt doesn't exactly fit like a 5x, more like a 4x and it's a little thinner than I thought it would be. Seems like the shirt is good to wear just for looks but doesn't feel like it would hold up to any heavy usage. It's okay.",B00027FWJA
"i really like this shirt. although its more like a thin jacket. eight, seven, six, five, for, three, two, one.",B00027FWJA
"Great authentic feel and weight, you can tell it is stitched durable with large heavy duty buttons. This was better then I expected it to be, the camo is perfect,  also bought boonie hat and pants all camos are pefect matches and go great togethe. I wear 3x and ordered 3x It is much larger then typical 3x so size down",B00027FWJA
"I was a little worried that I may have to send this shirt back. I ordered my normal size (large) and from reading some of the other reviews I thought it would be to big. It was not. These shirts are not tight fitting by that I mean they fit my shoulders perfectly but are some what loose fitting around stomach,waist,and chest area. I like it like that.

Good price as well.
I think I will buy more.",B00027FWJA
"These were purchased to replace the set I had and wore for nearly 15 years.  A bit stiff but with a few washing cycles, they are becoming as comfortable as my last pair.  I still think this is one of the best camo patterns out there.",B00027FWJA
"very nice, fit well color is spot on great for casual or hunting wear.  I am very pleased. Had problem with size seller was very helpful.",B00027FWJA
"a blouse is what it's actually called by the way, and there are 4 pockets as of any military blouse, 2 up top, and 2 on bottom. the usuall.",B00027FWJA
"Kind of like my old (mid 80's) Army bdu's. Nice material, seems sturdy enough for every day wear at work. Maybe just a little big on the sizing, but that's OK with me since I like 'em a little loose.

Recommended? Yes",B00027FWJA
This shirt is great. The quality is very good. The sizing was accurate and I am  very pleased with my purchase.,B00027FWJA
"I travel a lot, and bought this as a jacket for traveling. As a jacket it is light enough to wear all year, and the 4 pockets can hold everything that I don't pack in my bags.",B00027FWJA
"This is a solidly made shirt, with good material, it seems. However, I ordered the 2XL, and after one washing, it shrunk down to no more than an XL, leaving it rather short in both the body and arms for me. Keep in mind the shrinkage if you intend to order this shirt. If I had to do it over, I'd give it a pass. The Rothco stuff is far superior.",B00027FWJA
"This BDU shirt it strong, durable, and fits great. I'm using it for paintball and it has the fabric that is perfect for the style of game play. We play in the woods and there has been other that have torn from catching on twigs and different things. This style just keeps going hard to tear.
I would recommend this to anyone.",B00027FWJA
"This shirt is well made of heavy duty material. Good quality. If I have any problems with the fit it would be the fact that , for me, the sleeves  are a bit long. Otherwise, there are no complaints. This shirt should last a long while.",B00027FWJA
"I love this shirt, its very durable.  Ive taken this through hell and never had a problem with it thus far.",B00027FWJA
I had been looking for an army jacket but they were all so expensive.  This jacket was great quality and the price was amazing.  I added studs to the pocket and patches on the arm.  Turned out great.,B00027FWJA
I have had Rothco products for years. They are comfortable and they last. I always go back. Unless you don't want as many pockets or need a different material I can't imagine what is not to like here.,B00027FWJA
I got this for my Boyfriend. He loves them as much as the pants. They are both made very well and are comfortable. We will be buying more of them.,B00027FWJA
this is something i recommend i enjoy wearing this around the house gets the feel of nice clothing i like it,B00027FWJA
it is about what i expected. i would recommend to a friend.  looks sharp and up to specs.nice look overall,B00027FWJA
"Just what I wanted
My son is in the army and it looks just like his uniform.
Now we can go paintballen together",B00027FWJA
very well made and looks real life like the one i had in Vietnam back in the 1968-1970. recommed complete,B00027FWJA
"Should have gotten a size smaller because they are loose anyway but the sleeve adjustments make them work.
They are not as Subdued as I exspected",B00027FWJA
I think your products are fantastic and hope for more business with you in the future.  Thanks for your attn to detail.,B00027FWJA
"I bought these to use for Airsoft and hunting. I admit I was shocked. I wasn't expecting that great of quality but they are actually military grade and quality. I bought tops, bottoms and boonie covers for these and the black. I even bought a black octagon Marine cover for the black ones. If they had one in tiger stripe I'd have bought that too. They wash up fine and don't turn into wrinkle-bombs when they are dried. I shook them out and hung them up and fought off my Marine urge to iron the crap out of them to make them look ""perfect"" because I'm using them for field cammies. ;) Over-all great product.",B00027FWJA
"I bought this jacket about 2 years ago. I'm working in the military down here in the tropic.
Commonly I used this shirt in very extreme weathers.
It is still in the same color, it only has some minor scratches.
I strongly recomend this Shirt.",B00027FWJA
"Works really good, but you must wash the pants and shirt at the same time. This way one won't fade more than the other. I now have light OD pants and a dark OD shirt.",B00027FWJA
"Wore out my old BDUs so went looking for new - GOT to have the pockets.  These are great!  As good as Uncle Sam gave me all those years ago.  I wanted somthing with long sleeves I could roll up in warm temps but pull them down and be heavy enough to work as a light jacket when the temps turn cool... AND THE POCKETS!  If your looking for a shirt for similar reasons, you can't go wrong getting one or more of these.
Happy Camper",B00027FWJA
"Order came in a timely manner, and was exactly what was shown. Will order from this company again.  Very nicely made.",B00027FWJA
"When I ordered this item my initial use was to use it to go hunting and camping because I thought the material was a little softer like an ordinary shirt, but when I received it I got something totally different, the material is rough and thick and almost heavy on wearing which is fine by me because it could also be used as a coat my only problem with this item and the reason i didn't rate it a 5 was because even though I'm at 6'3 190 pounds and this item sized at medium it is still a little to big! So choose your sizes carefully.",B00027FWJA
This is a solid shirt with all the pockets you would expect.  Can't go wrong with this Camo Shirt.,B00027FWJA
I bought this for my brother for paintball and he seemed to be very happy with it in terms of looks and fit.,B00027FWJA
"Pro

Rugged contruction

Plenty of pockets

nice shade of black

adjusts easily

Con

tapers outwards instead of inwards

buttons can be confusing",B00027FWJA
"Not quite as good as my issued cammies, but for the price and being Chinese manufactured it's expected. Very similar to the real thing. Looks nice, too. Good for shooting and stuff.",B00027FWJA
The shirt was great fit for my husband and it was an perfect match with my outfit.,B00027FWJA
i got a large and it is humongous. i have to send it back and get the right size. will update review when i receive.,B00027FWJA
Fits great and looks better than the pic. This shirt looks better than the MultiCam that I bought. I guess Im new to the MultiCam world but the woodland camo looks better than the pic shows but my MultiCam looks dull and not like its pic. Overall I love this camo and found that woodland camo disappears better in the woods than MultiCam does.,B00027FWJA
"I bought these BDU's for hunting in XL to go over my clothes and M65 thermal pants and jacket liners for cold weather. I like the cotton/poly blend as it's soft and quiet but mostly durable to walk through rough terrain and thorns at a much more affordable price than any hunting ""brand"" clothing, The camo pattern suits me fine and I can blend it to most bark trees/wooded areas I hunt in and add foliage for a 3D effect if I need to.",B00027FWJA
"Are you kidding me?? These are ridiculous small. The dye smell is so bad, I had to put them in the garage. I wouldn't even donate them. What a waste of money. It costs as much as these boxers to return. You get what you pay for. Lesson learned.",B000283BUQ
"For a large size, I really should have got XL",B000283BUQ
Major shrinkage after one wash in cold water and air dried...I cannot wear them...buy much larger than you wear.,B000283BUQ
"I watered extra large waist was a small the seat was an extra large and the Lego openings were for a very small child
Nothing at all like original product not worth the trouble",B000283BUQ
Way!!!!  too smal for an XL.  I buy XL in other boxer short brands and they fit fine!,B000283BUQ
ordered one size larger and was still way to small!,B000283BUQ
Shorts did not feel comfortable.  Stiff even after washing.  Bottom was baggie.  Not as soft as I remember.  I was not pleased with the overall feel of the shorts,B000283BUQ
ordered boxers in size large but their large size feels more like a medium.,B000283BTM
"I ordered two of these shirts from a walk-in store.  They looked very nice, akin to a fitted T-shirt as opposed to my comfy surplus Tshirt.  Any time I would wear these shirts the seams in the underarm seam area would rub and stick in my armpit.  A day wearing these was very uncomfortable.  I tried washing them in different detergents and nothing seems to work to stop this.  I don't know why I keep them other than in case I need a cleaning rag.",B000288EEE
"The shirt arrived quickly.  The brown shirt is true to the color displayed and comes out of the dryer wrinkle-free.  It's soft to the touch and is well-constructed, yet thin enough to wear under another shirt.",B000288EEE
"This T-shirt is a waste of money. I work in LE and use it as an undershirt, nothing less, nothing more. Well, three months after casual use the color faded dramatically and holes started popping out in a couple places on the shirt. Its low quality material and definitely not long lasting. I usually trust and depend on Rothco items, even since I was in the Military, but this time around.... No go!!Very disappointed.",B000288EEE
"Not a big fan of Rothco products but I really like this shirt. If you buy a cotton version I'd be afraid of shirking and order a size larger, but in this version it's not needed, or was for me.",B000288EEE
Fits nice. Heavy duty material! I can't wait to buy more!,B000288EEE
"Better than expected, I'm buying another one! Quality shirt, keeps you cool and dry. My entire unit are buying these shirts.",B000288EEE
"60% COTTON and 40% POLYESTER T SHIRT. Now, it was described as 100% cotton, and that's what I wanted to buy. Color is good; fit is good. Just not the 100% cotton. Will not buy again.",B000288EEE
"Item came in as expected, nothing was damaged.  Shirt fits good, no fading or wear, brand new.  Relaxing to wear around the house and outside.",B000288EEE
"This is an awesome shirt,  very comfortable,  looks good and it's held up well.  I Will definitely buy a rothco again.",B000288EEE
"The descriptor  color ""brown"" was not accurate for what the term color ""brown"" notmally describes. Shirt was more on the green side.",B000288EEE
These shirts fit perfect and feel very nice and comfortable. I would tell all my friends about these to order from you.,B000288EEE
Great T-shirt keeps you cool and fits great!! I will definitely buy more soon! They have authentic military style and colors!,B000288EEE
good quality nice finishing soft and nice i recommend this item 100 percent.,B000288EEE
great tshirt and its simple and affordable,B000288EEE
"These T-shirts feel great, wear great, and look great. Quality made and will probably hold up well.",B000288EEE
"These are what they say that they are, but are not as high quality as Rotcho's cotton blends or straight up synthetics. They won't last long in my daily use.",B000288EEE
"The size 4/6 fit my average sized 4 year old girl (wears a 4T) perfectly. Covers skates with eyelet closure. I would consider these to be a little ""darker"" nude.",B000289LWS
I do t like how it gets holes really fast.. I guess its just a stocking.. But still...,B000289LWS
Material is well made and easy to out on. My daughter loves it with her ice skating outfit. It completed her look. Keep in mind my 5year old is a fashionista. Besides ice skating well she wants to look pretty doing it.,B000289LWS
"These are obviously the perfect show/competition tights.  DO buy an extra pair.  Even though they are nice and thick, my daughter ripped them in just one dress rehearsal and short performance.",B000289LWS
Bought it for my 4-year old daughter for her ice-skating show. It didn't run like other kids'.  Also gave her a good layer keep her warm.,B000289LWS
"Ripped very easily over skates. Tip, I used clear nail polish to keep it from ripping more quickly but I need a thicker product.",B000289LWS
"My daughter wore these over the rental skates for a skate show and they had holes in them (all over the boot) after one wearing. The rental skates were a bit thicker than regular skates so that may have been why. Very happy with the coverage (nice and thick) - you couldn't see the color of the rental skates, which I was worried about from looking at the picture. We managed to get through a second wearing but they are now done for.",B000289LWS
"These are nice and thick, but a little hard to clasp on the bottom.  Overall they worked nicely for what I needed.",B000289LWS
These are the best skating tights my daughter has had,B000289LWS
"My daughter wore one of the pairs, I ordered, for a skating competition & we got through her skating two routines without any snags or rips. I don't like the eye hook connection though, not so easy to work with, but all & all they weren't to bad. She has one more competition, next weekend, so hopefully we can get through that one with no snags or rips too.",B000289LWS
Got a snag in it only after 2 times wearing it,B000289LWS
They fit great true to size. Just wish they were a little thicker.,B000289LWS
"Nice, comfortable and warm for figure skating. Not too thick either.",B000289LWS
"Just as expected, no complaints!",B000289LWS
"Purchase at least 2 pairs a month for my daughter, definitely a great fit. They do there job the best they can protecting her legs at the roller rink, and the color is a good match.",B000289LWS
High quality! Recommended I continue looking my perfect size,B000289LWS
My daughter loves them.  They don't last but that's to be expected.,B000289LWS
Tore on the first time wearing them.. I expected them to last longer than 2 hrs,B000289LWS
"I got M because of the size chart. I'll keep them because I think S will be too short, but may have to pin the waist.",B000289LWS
The best I have bought. Nice dense weave. But still stretches enough for a nice fit.,B000289LWS
"GIrls love them, comfortable.  Use for roller-skating.",B000289LWS
I usually wear a medium or large and the small was too big!,B00028AR0I
They fit perfectly and are very durable.  Highly recommended!,B00028AR0I
My husband loved this hoodie. Washed very well and fit true to sizes. I must order none for me. ;0),B00028AQK4
This camo hoodie is made from a nice thick fabric. This camo fabric looks new. Kind of stiff at first but softens up after several washing/drying cycles. I have a zip front camo hoodie also. The camo fabric is of the zip hoodie is much nicer. It has that already broke in look and is much softer than the pullover style.,B00028AQK4
"Order this in a larger size because I'm a big guy. The fit is really tight around the midsection, so you might want to consider ordering a size or two larger than you would normally wear. It's also not very long, so if you're looking for a ""Baggie"":fit this hoodie isn't the way to go.

I use the hoodie for paintball, and it works well with the other equipment I wear, but otherwise I probably wouldn't wear it.",B00028AQK4
Great hoody! A lot better than I had expected. The fleece on the inside is softer than any other hoody I own. I would highly recommend it.,B00028AQK4
Like it more than i thought i would,B00028AQK4
"I love this sweatshirt,fits nicely",B00028AQK4
I like it all went well thank you,B00028AQK4
Great fit affordable price good quality,B00028AQK4
Definitely rums small. Order up one or two sizes. Bought it for my boyfriend. 200 lb. bought an xl. Should have got an xxl. Design is cool though.,B00028AQK4
Runs small and waistband it tight,B00028AQK4
I love Rothco clothing but I was a little disappointed in this hoodie. I ordered a XXL which normally fits just right but I could tell as soon as I put my head through this that it was too tight. Was hoping for a looser fit for layering underneath but that won't work here.,B00028AQK4
"These sweatshirts are lightweight which I LOVE but run a little small. I purchased a medium (a size up from my usual small) because I wanted it to be roomy, but after washing, wish I had gone for the large.",B00028AQK4
Shrunk too much after washing. Size up if you order it.,B00028AQK4
Got for all the right reasons. I am goof to go. Mens clothing r more roomy& warmer& more durable. Reason Enuff% Yeah Baby.,B00028AQK4
We bought this hoodie as a Christmas gift and my daughter loves it.  Its high quality and fit was right on.  I would recommend.,B00028AQK4
"runs small, we had to return....seemed like it was good material, never washed so don't know how it holds up to wear and tear",B00028AQK4
Wish I would have gotten one size bigger.  Its a little small but its good for winter when you layer up lol,B00028AQK4
"I normally wear a XL but thanks to the other reviews I ordered a 2XL.  It fits like I wanted it too.  I wish the arms were slightly longer, but we'll see what happens after it's washed.",B00028AQK4
"Terribly cheap material, tight fit.  Put it on first time and it ripped... do not buy this!",B00028AQK4
Great fit & really comfortable. Matches well with the Fall season,B00028AQK4
"Great hoody, it is just a little tight as I wear an XL but the size on this should be a L or L.5 so anyone who is looking to buy this order the next size that way it will fit correctly.",B00028AQK4
"It is a good looking sweatshirt, but it is very tight for it is a 3xl.",B00028AQK4
"This shirt is pretty cool. Brand new and cheap at that. I got this for my brother for Christmas. He loves Metallica, and so I decided to get this for him. It came in the mail as described. It wasn't fast though. I had to wait a little bit. But its worth the wait. If your not sure whether or not you should purchase this, I recommend it for all people who love this band.",B000297L38
"This is a classic shirt, and its condition is brand new. It was a perfect gift, and very well recieved. Awesome!",B000297L38
I bought my husband Metallica concert tickets for his birthday and got this shirt to go with them. He loves it! It is well made and fits him perfectly.,B000297L38
"This is a great fan t-shirt, at a great price. It's a great quality shirt. I am very satisfied with this seller.",B000297L38
"I think the shirt looks great. But the shirt is too small for a XXL, and the material is a little thin. If you are going to get this legendary shirt, it's advisable to get it one size over.",B000297L38
"I bought this shirt for my husband and he is very picky about t-shirts, and he loved the fabric quality of this shirt. It's not the cheap thin type of shirt. Very high quality!",B000297L38
"I purchased this for my grandson who enjoys Metallica and wanted a T-shirt.
The shirt is made of a durable cotton, well made and thick. It washes well and will last the tactics of a 13 year-old. Very pleased with the product.",B000297L38
"The colours are somewhat too bright (too green, too purple). It says 100% cotton, and I do not doubt the brand, but it looks like it is something else.
It is ok, but I would not buy it again.",B000297L38
Shirt is true to site.  Fit was perfect as expected when ordered.,B000297L38
Print is amazing better quality than what you can buy at the mall.  Even has the track listing of the great album it is!,B000297L38
Fits perfectly! Looks great! Handles wash and dry cycles well!,B000297L38
The shirt is of nice quality and it fit perfectly. It was a gift for my daughter.,B000297L38
"It's a cool thing to find T-shirts of classic metal bands without spending an arm and a leg. Amazon has such a huge selection, I'll be buying for quite a while--at least until I replace all the T-shirts I had from all those great concerts in the 1980's.",B000297L38
"The size is perfect, and the ink on the t-shirt fulfills its purpose. Would buy again!",B000297L38
I fit a little smaller than other medium shirts I've purchased before. I guess each shirt is different. All that aside I love my shirt!!!,B000297L38
Fit good. But the print on the front of the shirt seems to hold smells in it even after washing. Its quite strange.,B000297L38
Its a little shorter than I thought it would be. But I distressed to look older and vintage and it was a great price.,B000297L38
My teenage rocker son is very happy with this shirt.,B000297L38
Would love more if it was a softer cotton.,B000297L38
My son absolutely loves this t-shirt. He likes to wear his shirts so they are not tight or too short so we ordered a large and it fits just the way he likes it! Very pleased - will order from this company again.,B000297L38
"Awesome. Just like the ""years ago"" ones.",B000297L38
I bought this for my grandson. He loved it.,B000297L38
Better than the original. Very nice!,B000297L38
"Good quality cotton and nice, vibrant graphics.",B000297L38
"I had this shirt back in the late 80's but I grew out of it, (age wise AND size wise lol) and it was old and tattered. I seem to be going though my first midlife crisis as I rebought this 20+ years later. Way more vivid and a bigger picture than the original I had back then. Even the song list is on the back just like my old one. I still can't believe I wore a medium back then. :(
Very cool. Who needs a sports car at my age when you can just rock out instead?
Recommended.",B000297L38
METALLICA!!! best album and looked and fit great when I went to see them live,B000297L38
Greatest heavy metal album ever.,B000297L38
Awful quality of the t shirt and the print,B000297L38
"It looks really nice.
Though it's 100% cotton, I'm not really comfortable in it.",B000297L38
Shrunk about 2 sizes.  Definitely buy at least 1 size up.,B000297L38
Looks great and fits very well!!!,B000297L38
One of my favorite shirts fits perfectly,B000297L38
Really makes listening to Metallica better.,B000297L38
Awesome shirt fits nice. Design is on front and album names are on back very cool!,B000297L38
"Bought the shirt for my son, he loves it.  The shirt itself is sturdy/well made, will hold up through countless trips through the washing cycle.  The printed decals on the front and back of the shirt are thick and look like they will last for awhile.",B000297L38
"Gave as gift. Size was great, well received thanks",B000297L38
Bought this as a favor to a friend and she was very pleased with the t-shirt.,B000297L38
Will purchase another in the near future.,B000297L38
Correct fit but shirt material is so thick and heavy.  Was expecting a thinner/softer shirt.  Very cheaply made.,B000297L38
Excellent experience. I would buy from this seller again,B000297L38
"Great quality shirt. Unlike some of the reviews I've read, this shirt is of great quality. Does not feel cheap or thin and the album cover print is excellent. Very satisfied.",B000297L38
"It's my all time favorite Metallica shirt from their BEST album, Master Of Puppets, that was released back in 1986. RIP Cliff Burton.",B000297L38
My 12 year old aspiring metal head loves it.  :),B000297L38
"I love this shirt. It fits perfectly and it's a very cool design. The back also has all the tracks from the album in order. If you like Metallica, this shirt is for you.",B000297L38
"Nice shirt, but I thought I ordered a 3x.",B000297L38
Not a Bravado T-shirt was sent but instead a cheap quality one with odd sizing and cut.,B000297L38
"When I saw this was coming from overseas that is usually a red flag for poor quality,  but I loved the graphic. So I gave it a try.  Shirt was awesome looking, and fit well.",B000297L38
Figured the quality of these shirts would have improved since the late 90's. The T-shirt quality feels somewhat stiff and shrinks to an awkward shape that doesn't really work with me.,B000297L38
Quality shirt. Fits perfect. Awesome print. The hubby loves rockin it and he looks damn good in it. Recommend highly.,B000297L38
Higher quality than I expected. Thanks!,B000297L38
The quality of the shirt was not very good but I guess for 13 bucks that's what you get,B000297L38
Reminds me of the good ole days. Decent shirt,B000297L38
"cheap material. not a quality tee, but it gets the job done.",B000297L38
"My daughter was searching for just the right Metallica shirt, and this fit the bill.  Well made, not too thin and the printing is very nice.  Front and back!  Sizing as expected; generous.
She loves it, wears it often.  I would buy again - may have to if she wears it out!",B000297L38
"My 13-year-old son is a huge Metallica fan and he absolutely loves his shirt. He's 5' 4"" and 125 pounds. Th adult small fits him perfectly.",B000297L38
"Fit great. I am tall, 6'3"" tall, and it fit me well. A tad bit on the short side, but still a good fit. The quality of the shirt is decent too. $13-$15 for a shirt like this is a steal!",B000297L38
"The size of an imprint on the front is not proportional to the size of the t-shirt (in reality it is way too small). Besides there is no list of songs on the back of the t-shirt. And a seller didn't respond for my return request! Anyway I do not recommend, waste of money!",B000297L38
Terrible shirt! Looked fake and too small.,B000297L38
Purchased an adult small for my 12 year old son.  It fits well and is of good quality.,B000297L38
"fits perfectly. exactly what it says it is! i bought it for my boyfriend, and he LOVES it!",B000297L38
Too small and printing was not set centered to the shirt. Would not respond to return when requested.,B000297L38
"HORRIBLE quality, the logo looks like a 2 year old ironed on.",B000297L38
Awesome looks just like it looks in the picture in person,B000297L38
Quality is good.  Sizing is off (one size too small),B000297L38
"Friend excellent product real to the image, I appreciate your sincerity in the description of the product, and also appreciate the speed of the shipment.",B000297L38
Awesom shirt. This was a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved it. Fits as it should.,B000297L38
Exactly what I was looking for! Just like one I had back-in-the-day.,B000297L38
Absolutely terrible print quality! Will not order again,B000297L38
"Best present for my dad. Fit perfectly,love the design, fabulous gift. Why not get it .",B000297L38
"If you love Metallica, this is a great t-shirt.  Just the iconic name alone on the front ""Master of Puppets"" says it all.  Buy it, have fun wearing it, and let your rebel out.",B000297L38
Exactly what I had ordered. The shirt looks great and fits just right. I love that the songs are listed on the back.,B000297L38
Took almost a month to receive and is clearly a bootleg shirt..,B000297L38
"Excellent shirt, the material has a great quality and it is a bargain for the price. Great fit as well",B000297L38
"Great fit, material and paint high quality.",B000297L38
Shrinks a lot when washed and dried.,B000297L38
Great fit. I always wanted a Metallica shirt. Now I own one Hooray!!!,B000297L38
"Love this band, typical T-shirt size. I'm a girl, so these run in men sizes , and I got a L & I'm 5'3.",B000297L38
Just a I expected awesome t shirt and waiting for the big concert in my country,B000297L38
bought as a gift for my Nephew and he LOVED it.said it was perfect,B000297L38
"this shirt is as described and shown in the picture which is great, just that I stay something big but I guess I misjudge size",B000297L38
"Nice print job, shirt was a little small but overall I am really happy with the purchase.",B000297L38
"It was fated and did not look like the picture. I would not recommend buying from this person, if I were to rate it in stars it would be a 0",B000297L38
Great shirt! Exactly as pictured!,B000297L38
"Awesome Shirt, Made Well and Fits Perfect",B000297L38
"I love this shirt. High quality and very comfortable. Soft, and lightweight",B000297L38
"Bought the shirt in time to see them Aug 20, 2016 Minneapolis concert at the new stadium and witnessed the best concert METALLICA ever",B000297L38
"i love it alot, good material, thick and the body fits great but the arms i feel are a little too big, going to have to get it tailored or something",B000297L38
A little small but great quality!,B000297L38
"In my 40s now and remember the days, and they were some awesome days. They don't make rock and roll like this anymore. I got a compliment the first day I wore it...",B000297L38
the print is a little off center otherwise it a good shirt.,B000297L38
Overall good shirt. The material is a little thin.,B000297L38
"Lots of old people comment on this shirt to me, and I don't think folks know it was an album.
That can be weird.

Shirt is great though.",B000297L38
Nice t shirt. I didn't notice the military helmet on the tombstone when I ordered it. It's cool though. Has the song list on the back.,B000297L38
"Nice graffics, ordered one size bigger washed and it fits fine",B000297L38
cheapest t shirt quality ive experienced in a long time. Lasted about 2 washes before it became sleeveless,B000297L38
"This isn't the actual album print. The helmet, grass, and Metallica emblem are all the wrong color and style. Pretty disappointed. I'm embarrassed to wear it. But I will. Not worth it.",B000297L38
It was ok but 100percent cotton isn't what it use to be very thin material,B000297L38
Great fit and shirt!  Looking forward to wearing it at the next show.,B000297L38
My husband was very happy with his gift. Nicely made. Will be buying more shirts from this company.,B000297L38
"Good quality shirt.  The fabric is a little tough, but will hopefully soften up a bit after some washings.  But the shirt itself is exactly as expected, and arrived very quickly.  Overall, very pleased.",B000297L38
"The shirt isn't great quality; rough and scratchy, collar is not well stitched into the body. The color separations are old-school (good) but the colors themselves are too garish, especially the day-glo green. Wore it once, tossed it into the donation bin. A shame -- one of the best albums ever created. Check the shirts on the official band website instead.",B000297L38
"Fabric is nice, printing of high quality, but runs smaller than most Men's medium.  Our 15 year old son is wearing it when he does open mic nights so for now it is ok.  He's thin and very tall, so I would recommend adult men size up at least one.",B000297L38
Nice shirt fit well only downside was the print doesn't size up with the shirt. The one pictured had to be a small,B000297L38
It's a beautiful shirt I love it. Next time I buy one I will be getting a size bigger. It fits but a bit small. I will be buying again but definitely a large next time. But I adore this shirt !!! I recommend it for sure.,B000297L38
Good quality. Great fit. Looks fsntastic.,B000297L38
Quality shirt. Not cheap. I didn't realize the songs from the album were written on the back. I wanted a 2007 but got a 2012. 2007 are not easy to find. Would order again.,B000297L38
"Bought this shirt for my teenage daughter and was nervous buying it sight unseen as I wasn't sure it would fit properly or that sizing would vary, however the sizing was totally accurate and the quality was perfect. Great buy for the price arrived quickly and as expected",B000297L38
Love metallica. Love the shirt. Enough said.,B000297L38
"great shirt printed like the original with the track listing on the back, fits well",B000297L38
I loved it I am a woman but med men's fits me well and the colors are amazing!,B000297L38
great looking shirt but shrunk like my junk in cold water...hang dry,B000297L38
This shirt was a gift for my son he loved it.,B000297L38
"This is a great shirt. The coloring is remarkable, the quality is incredible, and I can't say enough good about this shirt. But there is just one problem... It shrinks. Alot. The first time I tried it on, it was almost baggy (and I'm fat too) and I ordered an XL. I was surprised. But when it was washed, it is now tight in the chest and shoulders. It might be just me, but this shirt does shrink, so if your a bigger person or whoever else you may be, keep this in mind.",B000297L38
"I got this item a while back ago, but I never got a chance to review it. Very nice t-shirt and got what I wanted.",B000297L38
I've Metallica since I was a small child and like the artwork just fair warning although the material doesn't feel like it's 100 percent cotton but rather polyester.,B000297L38
I was under the imprecision that the shirt was blank on the back but it has writing on the back. Would have been nice to know before i bought it.,B000297L38
Great shirt! Just the track list on the back seem a little unnecessary.,B000297L38
Overall pleased with this shirt and it's price!  We ordered it a little big since it was 100% cotton and after the first washing it did shrink some.,B000297L38
My grandson loved it. He is a big Metallica fan. It has been washed multiple times and is holding up just fine.,B000297L38
Doesn't hold up after a single wash!,B000297L38
"If you're buying this shirt its probably not the 1st of this you have owned. U know what to expect, logo on front is bright and good detail. An absolute classic.",B000297L38
"Fit perfect I'm 6'1"" and 125lbs which generally means nothing fits me right but it does and is super comfortable to boot",B000297L38
"Absolutely fabulous. I cut the sleeves out, wore a fanny pack and fingerless mesh gloves. It looks great with my mullet hair cut, blowing in the wind while driving my T-Bird.. I absolutely changed my life when I saw this shirt. It made me a better person.",B000297L38
Decent shirt for the money. Arrived quickly.,B000297L38
"Ok, I love this shirt. Metallica being my favorite metal band, and Master of Puppets my favorite album from them, I HAD to get this shirt. I absolutely adore it. It fits great, and feels great, I couldn't have asked for more. Thanks.",B000297L38
I've owned this shirt for years and real Metallica fans despise this shirt because of the fact that it really lacks the real visual of the album artwork. Put this artwork next to the actual album cover and it's so off its not even funny.,B000297L38
"I wish it were a softer fabric, but otherwise I like it a lot.",B000297L38
Great purchase!  Really good material.,B000297L38
Great fit!! Awesome feel! Great item!!,B000297L38
"My son loves the shirt. It fits well for this Metallica fan. There were no problems with the shirt. The design was clear and bright. The shirt is good quality and has held up after repeated washings. He is 6'-3"" and 270 lbs and finding shirts that fit can be a challenge sometimes, this shirt in XXL fit him well.
I would recommend this to all the metal heads out there.",B000297L38
PERFECT FIT.  Vivid graphics.  Many compliments.,B000297L38
"The  shirt is ausome. Fits as expected. Colors are nice. The matierial is strong and durable, not that cheap ragged stuff that other sellers use. Very happy with my purchase. Will buy again.",B000297L38
"Excellent quality, great fit, and lots of compliments while wearing it in public.  I've since purchased other rock t-shirts from ""Bravado"" since I was so pleased with this product :)",B000297L38
"Great-looking shirt, the colors are bright and looks perfect in every way. However, it is small and I haven't even washed or dried it yet.  We all know it will shrink a little there also. I may have to return it.",B000297L38
"Was a great shirt, until washed.  I washed it in cold water, and put it in the drier on a lower heat setting and it STILL shrunk.  My son is VERY disappointed. So much for trying to buy him something he will love for a long time.",B000297L38
"Great shirt, color is awesome gets your attention right away! Fits great as expected! Thank you!",B000297L38
The shirt fits really well and the material is nice.,B000297L38
This was a great purchase. Bought this shirt for my husband and he loved it. The color of the print is good and the sizing is right. Can't wait to use it for the Metallica concert!,B000297L38
ordered this Metallica t-shirt and ended up with a stinking Guns and Roses I hate guns n roses very disappointed!!!,B000297L38
I'm probably going to buy another shirt soon,B000297L38
Nice shirt.  Material is of average thickness.  Screening is good quality.,B000297L38
Fit me perfect and looks good even after many washes.,B000297L38
This looks really good on my husband!,B000297L38
Nice shirt. Quality is decent and t-shirt is kind of thick. shrink a little but still ok. recommened to any metallica fans.,B000297L38
Order a size larger.  Shrinks in wash,B000297L38
"Disappointed. Material is cheap feeling. There is not a picture for it but there is wording on the back, songs on the album, I think. Would have been a nice surprise were it not for the fact that those words are noticeably crooked. One, shirt was just fine without the words, in purple, on the back. Two, if you can get the front on straight you must have some inkling of how to do your job. This was bought as part of my husband's birthday present. Was supposed to be a fun nod to one of his favorite bands while growing up. Doubt that I will even show it to him, certainly will not wrap it as a gift.",B000297L38
i love this shirt :). It fits perfectly.,B000297L38
"Came on time, Looks gerat, not like some cheap shirt you can get at Wal-mart, it even had the Master of Puppets track list on the back which I did not remember seeing on the product page",B000297L38
Great quality shirt. Material is nice not cheap feeling. Fits well. Very pleased.,B000297L38
"Seems to be a high quality shirt, slightly smaller than expected.  The big problem is the shading on the front and the song titles printed on the back are a hideous lavender color. Needless to say, I won't be wearing it.",B000297L38
"I love the shirt. I'm a female and the size is nice, fits me and hugs my curves slightly. The design is great too.",B000297L38
"This shirt looks great and has held up well. I bought it for my son about a year ago, and the graphics still look bright and clear. He wears it often enough that it gets washed every week or two, and it still looks great. I generally wash it in warm water with regular detergent, then toss it in the dryer with medium heat, so I was impressed that it didn't shrink or fade, and the graphics haven't cracked. I highly recommend this for a true Metallica fan.",B000297L38
Perfect fit and quick and easy shipment :-),B000297L38
"Very nice looking t-shirt and fits well, although a little bigger than expected, but my boyfriend loved it.",B000297L38

My boyfriend absolutely loves this shirt!,B000297L38
Got this for my son for Christmas and is has worn it nearly every day since. Fortunately he is an avid shower taker or this shirt would be disgusting by now. Sure made him happy! And the price was right too!,B000297L38
This is an amazing shirt. Lyrics on the back.,B000297L38
Shirt sizes are a bit small  I got one size bigger for me and it shrunk down to the perfect size after I wash and dry it,B000297L38
Fisrts Metallica's t shirt that fit perfect to me.,B000297L38
The print looks fantastic. And it still fits well after the first wash. Overall it's a pretty good shirt and it's an ideal shirt for every Metallica fan.,B000297L38
Nice price.  I bought 2.  Go figure.,B000297L38
LOVE THE SHIRT! Looks exactly like the picture. A great shirt for a great album.,B000297L38
"Great color and fit. Looks amazing. The shape is okay, kind of a general t-shirt shape but it's still a great shirt.",B000297L38
"This is very bright and nice looking. It will last a long time.
I wanted to mention that the songs are listed on the back since the pictures do not show a back view.",B000297L38
I was way more impressed and satisfied with the quality of this shirt than I expected.  High quality shirt and print.,B000297L38
"nice, clean new graphic quality.  i was surprised that the track list was printed on the back.  I would've preferred it blank.",B000297L38
This was a gift for my son.  He loved it!,B000297L38
Shirt fit great and get lots of compliments when I go to a country concert.,B000297L38
This Metallica shirt was a perfect Christmas gift for my husband. It is good quality and fit as expected. My husband loves it.,B000297L38
Love the shirt but it seems to run small,B000297L38
i personally don't like the back but i knew it would be there when i chose to buy it but very pleased!,B000297L38
"This shirt is probably one of the coolest Metallica shirts that I have, the fabric is good, pretty standard and it fits as expected. I don't regret buying it.",B000297L38
Great shirt tough durable nice print. thank you for being affordable as well,B000297L38
Fits correctly and my friend loved it!,B000297L38

I was impressed by the quality & the price was more than reasonable.,B000297L38
Nice product. Would recommend this seller.,B000297L38
Too Big . however the quality of the t shirt is not bad.,B000297L38
I been wearing it a lot too.  Metallica rocks.,B000297L38
"Metallica shirt rocks, fitgreat as  thought.,the print was just like the cd case and it had the song lst on the flp just lke when it came years ago.",B000297L38
i really love the band and this album the t-shirt's printing is nice but the t-shirt is too thick for me its not good to wear on summer to hot for me. but the Shirt is nice i recommend it to Metallica fans!,B000297L38
"I really didn't have my hopes up with this t shirt, but I was so pleasently surprised!!! The material is great quality, and the picture too, it is not like those that start creasing as soon as you wash them. I recommend this to anyone.",B000297L38
"This one will shrink half a size, even in delicate on wash and dry. Order a size larger to allow for shrinkage. I would rather have a shirt 1/2 a size to large that I can wear vs. a too small shirt that I cannot wear and wind up giving away:) Rock on!",B000297L38
"This is a Metallica T-shirt. It fit me just fine, wears well. It is black. What more do you want?",B000297L38
"It was a great quality shirt but for an XLarge it fit more like a large. I gave the shirt to my son instead of keeping it, but he loved it.",B000297L38
"the graphics on the shirt are really cool. although i couldn't see them well, when i ordered. my son loves rock bands and was super excited to have that particular band.",B000297L38
"This was ordered for someone around 190 pounds size large and it fit fine, has been washed and dried a few times and still looks and fits fine.",B000297L38
"He put it on and didn't want to take it off!  Exactly what he wanted!  Yep, he's a Metallica fan!",B000297L38
"I'm 5'8"" and weigh about 212lbs. Ordered the large and it fit perfect. Material is not cheap and the image is also well made. Sweet buy for the price. Would definitely recommend.",B000297L38
"GREAT GRAPHICS ON A QUALITY SHIRT !
ALSO INCLUDED GRAPHICS ON THE BACK OF THE SHIRT, WHICH WAS A AWESOME PLUS !",B000297L38
"I had a couple Metallica T's in my youth and it's nice to see these being reproduced.  I bought the MOP and AJFA shirts from Old Glory.  Each shirt was around 12 bucks so, no argument with the price.  I've washed these and the print is still bright and looks like it will hold up for a while.  Honestly. I can't wait for it fade some and get that worn look.  Some have argued that the shirt material is thin but I have no problem with that.  I really don't want to wear a heavy black tee in the summer.  One piece of advice; ORDER ONE SIZE LARGER THAN YOUR USUAL.  I usually wear a large but, with these tees, a large would be too short in the sleeves.  I ordered XL's and they fit great.",B000297L38
"I wore this shirt at the Metallica concert in Bogota, Colombia. I had many people asking where I had gotten this shirt... good quality material and silk screening.",B000297L38
"Love the quality, the fit, and the price! T-shirt is made of good quality material, which is sometimes hard to find in rock band t-shirts. Will definitely be searching for more t-shirts from this seller. Arrived on time as expected!",B000297L38
"let's face it, this is one of the most iconic Metallica albums ever. My 7 yr old son doesn't understand how influential this album was and how lucky he is to have this to wear. but he does like it b/c he can wear it whenever daddy is wearing his ""Kill
em All"" or ""Ride the Lightning"".",B000297L38
Good quality & good fit for a good price. Didnt realise that there is a list of songs at the back which makes it even better,B000297L38
"This shirt is AWESOME!!! and it was only $11!!
I was worried after I ordered it because the reviews said that the XXL was too small, but it fits perfectly! Awesome shirt, at an awesome price!",B000297L38
"Bought this for my son and it fits well, is comfortable, and is holding up better than most black t-shirts. The artwork is well done. I wash it on cool/cold, and dry it on low, and it's still going strong after many wearings and washings - over a year now.",B000297L38
"I went to this concert when I was 13 in Phoenix,Az! As time would have it, I got fat and lost the shirt between 20 something moves. Thanks!",B000297L38
"bought it as a gift for a friend and he absolutely loved it

he was really happy with the tshirt",B000297L38
The fabric is a little thin but for the price you really can't beat it.  I like the songs written on the back of this shirt.  I highly recommend this shirt.,B000297L38
"Perfect fit, everything it was said in the description. If you're a fan than this is a must have shirt.",B000297L38
"The material of the t-shirt itself is awesome, not cheap. Will wash well and last a long time. Better than expected!!",B000297L38
"Highly recommend this if your a fan, decent price and quality fit and design.  It's just a nice all around t-shirt.",B000297L38
"As others have pointed out, buy one size larger than what you usually wear. It shrinks considerably with use. Other than that, it's just a solid metallica tshirt.",B000297L38
Very good quality shirt and it got to me Very fast. I would definitely recommend. I ordered the extra large and it was just a bit small so I might go up a size.,B000297L38
"I literally just got my shirt , i love it ! The only problem was that it fit me big , i should've gotten a small . But overall its worth buying!!",B000297L38
"I specifically looked up  BRAVADO  on  Amazon because that's the name brand I've seen on graphic tees I've purchased from Target.

I was expecting Bravado to be the company that makes this shirt too but it's some other company named Delta Proweight.  The fit  is way different than I expected.  The bravado tees I've purchased  in  stores are much more fitted and  nicer.  This shirt looks more squared off an not my style but it's still a decent shirt so I won't give a bad review or rate it 3 stars like I originally wanted to.  If it was a  real  Bravado shirt, I'd easily rate it 5 stars",B000297L38
"great shirt, nice colors, the shirt quality it's great. the size it's correct. amazing product!. i'm going to buy more shirts.",B000297L38
"This is one of my sons favorite groups.  It was a Christmas present, got it in time for the holidays.  No complaints.",B000297L38
"Wow, this runs really small. The XXL was more like an athletic fit XL. The print wasn't centered correctly. Disappointed.",B000297L38
"Bought this tshirt to replace the same one my boyfriend has had for about 10 years. The old one is withering away and he absolutely will not get rid of it. I was so happy when I came across this tshirt, brand new and colorful. He will be so happy to open this up on Christmas! Love it!",B000297L38
"This shirt was too small for a person who regularly wears XXL. Nice shirt, just wish it fit the person I bought it for.",B000297L38
I knew when i saw it i had to have it.then i saw the price and couldn't believe how affordable it was,B000297L38
"It runs a little small, the print is a little tacky and I was disappointed of the quality of the material. I guess that for $10 you can't complain much.",B000297L38
"If you are a Metallica fan and don't own a master of puppet tee shirt then something is wrong with you! This tee shirt is very comfortable and does not run when you wash it. The quality could have been much better, however for this price you can't go wrong.",B000297L38
"You will do what I say when I say buy this shirt! From the back to the front, great print, and great material. If you are a fan of the band then get this shirt and show off one of the most successful heavy metal albums of the 80's and perhaps all time!",B000297L38
"I bought this shirt as a birthday gift. The print is great, but the T-shirt material is very thin :-(",B000297L38
I love Metallica....I love this t-shirt! It fits exactly as expected (I ordered a small). It's soft/comfy and will last me for years.,B000297L38
This shirt is awesome it was soft and fit perfectly. My only problem was with the graphics the crosses shadowing is purple also the underlining of metallica is bright purple also the green helmet is a very bright green. Besides those two flaws the shirt is great,B000297L38
this is wnderfull shirt it's very comfterible  and I would recommend this to all my friends its a keeper enjoy,B000297L38
"Printed on a basic black Hanes tagless shirt. The shirt shrunk up a little bit, and now fits perfect. Great purchase.",B000297L38
great shirt!!! very satisfied customer here!! metallica rules!!!! still looks good after multiple trip to the washer... will buy again..,B000297L38
cool shirt but unfortunately i will never wear it because it is way too thick for me and not very soft. maybe if i wash it everyday for the next 20 years it will be ready to wear.,B000297L38
"I purchased this for my brother's upcoming birthday. He's a diehard metal fan and especially loves Metallica so I'm sure he'll love this. For the price, I thought this was a great buy. The t-shirt is not overly thick which makes it perfect for hot summery weather, or it could always be worn under a sweater in cooler seasons. The picture on the front looks like its firmly in place, no peeling or anything, though I hope it remains the same after going through the wash. There's also a list of song titles from the album on the back. All in all, I think this is value for money.",B000297L38
"I am very happy with this order! I got it within a couple days, it was folded nice, right size, fit nice, and all around perfect! Thanks!",B000297L38
"OMG, this is the my favorite T-Shirt, i love metallica, ""bravado"" products is the best, MASTER OF PUPETS is the my favorite metallica album, and i love this T-shirt, thanks Bravado...",B000297L38
"Excellent print quality, good fabric.
Maybe too short for me as I am 6 ft 2 in?
I am fat but not thaaaat much, so I think this model is just a little short.",B000297L38
Great shirt for a hair band concert. Not shrinking and runs true to size. I highly recommend if you want a fun shirt.,B000297L38
This shirt is good quality and fits just right. The image after many washes isn't breaking and the shirt isn't faded. I would highly recommend.,B000297L38
"I got this shirt 2 days after I ordered it! It is everything I expected and more, high quality and looks great. T shirts on Amazon should have pics of the front and back of the shirt.",B000297L38
There is writing on the back that i was not made aware of when i bought the shirt. But still a great shirt none the less.,B000297L38
I love this shirt! It arrived VERY quickly and as described. The design is awesome and it also has the songs onthe album in purple letters on the back of the shirt - which I also love. It's awesome! I recommend this seller and the item as well!,B000297L38
"Perfect for my son! He loves Metallica, and is taking guitar lessons. He is learning to play their songs, This shirt was for his B-day! I hope the teachers won't make him remove it,because of stupid dress codes.",B000297L38
"superb tshirt. Ready for rocking at the concert and after....if that after is the office, is ok also. Raul Jimenez",B000297L38
"The perfect shirt at the perfect price.
I would recommend this to anyone a fan of Metallica.
I love it!",B000297L38
"Excellent product. The T - shirt was exactly as I expected and it arrived on time. Thanks.
I recommend it.",B000297L38
"...the material was also a bit weak. It was too short. Aside from that, it was pretty cool.

-BACK TO THE FRONT!",B000297L38
"fits awesome great product will recommend to family, friends and enemies. I don't no why you need to write 20 or more words its dumb",B000297L38
I love wearing this shirt to the grocery store and see all the dads want to start a conversation about Heavy Metal.,B000297L38
Good quality unbeatable price i just love this shirt it is really good you won't believe it when you get to have it,B000297L38
"My husband loves the shirt, perfect fit, seems to be really well made and super bright colors! It's a great deal you will not be disappointed!",B000297L38
"I first purchased this shirt because I saw someone else wearing this shirt and since I liked Metallica (And especially their Master of Puppets album), I decided on getting it. It's a shirt I've worn quite often since I got it. Definitely a must-buy for any Metallica fan out there.",B000297L38
"i put a 5 star rateing because the t shirt was brand new, so obviously it was in excelent condition. Awesome. i want to buy more,but no money",B000297L38
Purchased two of these shirts for gifts.  My son and grandson like this shirt and when it gets washed it does hold it shape.  No color fade either.  Nice shirt and fit true to size.,B000297L38
It just looks like a cheap tee. The graphics aren't impressive. My husband is a big fan of Metallica but he's owned this shirt for two months and has never worn it. The shirt itself isn't thin or see thru so I think it'll wash up well. It's just the graphic itself that I'm not thrilled about.,B000297L38
The product fits great. I ordered it for a family member and he loved it. the design is nice too.,B000297L38
"This was a gift for my husband.  He loves it, said it's perfect, size medium works well.  The price was great, arrived quickly.",B000297L38
This was on my sons wish list for Christmas. It arrived on time and in good condition. My son has already worn it a couple of times.,B000297L38

Awesome detail on the shirt . love it",B000297L38
My husband and I took my grandson to see Metallica a few years ago.  I bought this shirt for him to remind him of the great time we had and also because we love Metallica.,B000297L38
"metallica master tees, I have many many, and this model is super cool
metallica all shirts are awesome
and this, very good value for money and above all the design",B000297L38
"This shirt is well made, sturdy, and the print survived the wash. Best way to describe the first Metallica album I listened to, the first that made me a fan, and one of my favorite albums. Definitely recommend this shirt. I bought this shirt from Old Glory so I do recommend them.",B000297L38
"I recently purchased this product and when i put it on it felt really soft then i checked the brand and it said hanes, very disapinted to be honest it still looks cool but im not sure if its gonna last long",B000297L38
"Boyfriend loves the shirt! The print out is sturdy and haven't ripped at all. I recommend for any Metallica fans.

The quality is really good overall.",B000297L38
"Shirt received promptly, but the shirt neck hole was way too small. I snagged on my adams apple and I choked.  After I was able to squeeze my head through, the shirt felt like sand paper (all parts).  Do yourself a favor and buy a true Master t-shirt.  And sorry Goodwill, this shirt is coming your way!",B000297L38
"I bought this shirt as a gift for my little brother and he really enjoys it.

Same type of quality you would normally expect had you gone to the mall and bought it there.",B000297L38
"this is a cheap after market shirt. aweful thick fabric, some brand called allstyle . THIS IS NOT A BRAVADO SHIRT! we have 3 others that have the bravado logo printed in the inside. everything is printed in thick plastic screen. So very disappointing. will not buy a tshirt from old glory via amazon.",B000297L38
Bought this for a family memeber and it fit them perfectly,B000297L38
excellent tshirt...great colors,B000297L38
"My 15 year old son came out of left field and told me he's into Metallica. I did a headbang then jumped online to get him a shirt. Cool shirt, good quality, fits fine. Rock on!",B000297L38
Purchased a mens smaller for my 12 year old son (he is about the size of a 9-10 year old) fits great.,B000297L38
Awesome shirt! Boyfriend fell in love with it immediately!,B000297L38
"Regular T-shirt quality, I usually wear an XL and this was too wide and big for me.  Length was good.",B000297L38
"The American Flag shirt I purchased fit just right,and I received a lot of great comments on how people loved the shirt. I was able to ware the shirt on Memorial Day to represent my Honor for all our soldiers who have died for our Freedom.",B00029I0YW
I ordered this shirt because I am riding my horse in a 4th of July Parade and I had not outfit.  I was sad because I didn't have much time to find something and I saw this item would was not forecasting to get here on time but I ordered it and hoped for a miracle.  Ordered on Thursday and got it today Monday!  Thank you sooooooooooooo much!!!,B00029I0YW
"While I love the design of the shirt...the quality is okay but the SIZE is way off.  I ordered an extra large because well... I'm not a small girl.  This shirt runs very small.  I would put it size as between a standard Medium and Large not an extra larger.

Good quality...poor sizing.  As long as you remember they run small it is a GREAT shirt.",B00029I0YW
Gotta love flag. Great colors. Just wish it came with snaps. Fingertips numb so buttons are slow to do.,B00029I0YW
It was a great choice for our support your Super Bowl team.,B00029I0YW
"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  I had it dry cleaned and pressed before I was to wear it for a special event and the red bled on the white stripes.  Returned for a refund!  It runs a little small in the chest, I would've gone up one more size.",B00029I0YW
"like the shirt, but the XL size is smaller than most other XL shirts.",B00029I0YW
Extremely well constructed and high quality fabric. This is not a flimsy cotton.,B00029I0YW
I wear a 73/8 and it's almost too small for me,B00029PI7O
bought this to shoot a music video (Real or Fake)  and it looks pretty real. I like it and would recommend it to anybody who wants to play dress up.,B00029PI7O
Great fit. right style. just as pictured. will see how it stands up to the elements but as of right now am very happy.,B00029PJJG
"for the outdoorsman while hanging out, grilling, hiking or whatever. nice price. quality product. nice price. I bought three other colors as well. i would recommend",B00029PJJG
"It's a great boonie hat . I have many other's and I plain to have them all .
Thank you very much
Adam",B00029PJJG
"This hat is not worth the amount they are charging for it
when I got this hat I tried it on the top of the hat the material is so thing you can see day light
Instead of wasting money to return I just put it in the trash can.
*I used a gift card to purchase this item.",B00029PJJG
"It is exactly what it looks like. It is kind of smallish on my fat head but it may be because they didn't make a bigger size.

Don't get a fat head.  And unless you are in the jungle or whatever there is no way to wear the chin strap without looking like a 10 year old cowboy.

On occasion I am told I look like a paleontologist because I have mutton chops. So maybe do grow a fat head and mutton chops and the power of both make you look smarter.

Or at least someone who is always looking for grants so I can dig.",B00029PJJG
This is a great quality alternative item to paying out more money for some of the more expensive military items provided by other companies. I own a number of Rothco-Ultra Force items and they have always lasted me thhroughout years of rugged use and abuse. A+,B00029PJJG
"This is a nice straightforward Boonie hat - well made - strong, not flimsy - good deep black color - recommend it to anyone - I might spray it with water repellent.",B00029PJJG
"The hat arrived in a timely manner. The fit was right on. I did wash it before I wore it. I let it dry while it was still wet so that it would keep its shape better. The hat seems well constructed, only time will tell. So far I am very pleased with this hat.",B00029PJJG
"I don't like wearing the usual 'basebal caps' type of hats so I decided to get this instead.  I have to say at less than $9 this boonie hat is a steal.  It feels great, it doesn't look cheap.  If anyone asks tell them it cost you $30 dollars because it looks and feels that good.  Now that the summer is here, this is a definite must, keeps the sun away from your face.

I'm not sure if it's waterproof or not but I believe it isn't.

Only problem I had is that it was a little tight at first, I guess I should've got the 7 3/4 but I noticed that the more you wear it the more it stretches to fit your head.

At $8.99 you can't go wrong, specially if this is your first boonie hat ever, like me.",B00029PJJG
"Good hat, but runs a bit larger than the standard military ones.",B00029PJJG
"item as described ,good fit, Happy.",B00029PJJG
It's a boonies hat that fits well. End of story.,B00029PJJG
great product. fits as advertised!!,B00029PJJG

This hat was a great price and I really like it!,B00029PJJG
"I was looking for a ripstop hat due to their breathing properties, but was surprised that this kept me nearly as cool with the exhaust/air flow vents. It's a sturdy and rugged material that holds shape well and stayed on during some of the most rigorous training. I took a gamble and was very impressed. The construction is substantial in all key areas and expect many years of very good serviceable use. Highly recommend.",B00029PJJG
"Well final ordered my black boonie I had been looking for little while. I did not know my hat size, I didn't think I had a big head, so  I went ahead and ordered it. Well to my dismay when I received the boonie it was a disaster. My wife started laughing, my cats were freaking out I could even hear my neighbor's laughing their XXXes off. **** It was to small ****, Yes I said it, it was to small, but it was made well, looked better on my wife then I. I was put down in my own home, WAM. I will not attempt this mission again.",B00029PJJG
its well made very thick and doesnt fade after washing but way to hot in the summer it runs alittle small it will not stretch,B00029PJJG
I will be ordering more to have before they change it. I wear this when working outside in the rain.,B00029PJJG
I have several Rothco boonie hats and will order more.,B00029PJJG
Excellent product is what you buy very satisfied,B00029PJJG
"Excellent product, excellent seller",B00029PJJG
Expected the material to be a little heavier.,B00029PJJG
Everything that i expected.  Sizes are true fit.,B00029PJJG
"I've been a 7 1/2 for years. I own probably 2-3 dozen New Era fitted hats, Nike, and Reebok hats as well as other brands of bucket hats. This hat just doesn't fit like a 7 1/2. Too tight of a fit. Looks sweet though",B00029PJJG
Awsome purchase ! I'll be back for more ,B00029PJJG
This sweatshirt is of excellent quality.  It is heavy and warm.  It has a metal zipper.  Plastic ones break easily.  My husband really likes this sweatshirt.,B00029PKNQ
"Sleeves are kinda tight, other than that, a ok.",B00029PKNQ
"Edit, 10 months later: well i ordered this on 6/01/17 and then today, 3/08/18. The stupid zipper just totally breaks for no reason. So now it will NOT zip up at all. So now i cant wear it in the cold at all, and that was the main reason i bought it!

Edit 2: since I only wore the sweatshirt for 3 months and the zipper broke, the seller was nice enough to send me a brand new one! He even sent me a bigger size which I ask for! This seller is awesome! Hopefully this sweatshirt doesn't fall apart like the last one did!

Edit 3: They sent me a brand new sweatshirt, same one, except this one is one size larger and fits great! These are wonderful people that sell this item!!

 So now I have changed my review to this, the sweatshirts come in a smaller size, so if a person who wears a large such as myself,  needs to order a XXL just so it fits correctly.
And then there's the zipper, a zipper should last the entire lifetime of the sweatshirt. I have a jacket that I my girlfriend bought me when I was 16 years old I'm now 33 and that's zipper works perfectly! However only 10 months after ordering the sweatshirt zipper no longer works, so now I cannot wear in the cold which was the main reason I bought the damn thing! This thing gets two stars now...

Amazing sweatshirt, Fits great, and keeps you warm in the cold. On a side note, if you plan on ordering one, do yourself a favor and order one size larger. I ordered my exact size and it was much to small, however the seller did a fantastic job of getting me the correct size in no time at all. Maybe took them 48 hours. The camo print is ""bright"" and ""colorful"", well as bright and colorful as it can be for a camouflage pattern...",B00029PKNQ
"If you are going to order this, make sure you order a size larger, at least. If you like them to be baggy, You might want to think about 2 sizes larger. I wear an XXL and like them to be a bit baggy and read all the comments and ordered a 3XL. It fits like an XXL and is not very baggy. It's made decently, but a lot of loose hanging threads, so I'm hoping it will last awhile. I like the thermal lining and it's heavier than I thought it would be. Perfect for the Arizona winters in the desert. I love the camo pattern. I almost gave it 3 stars because of the size of it and the hanging threads, but the quality of it is better than I thought it would be.",B00029PKNQ
Worth every penny! Great quality!,B00029PKNQ
"I received this as a gift.  For the most part I like it.  It's light enough to wear around the house, but also warm enough to take the dog out etc.  If you are in between size go up a size.  There was a little shrinkage after washing.

I have 1 complaint. The sleeves are VERY tight.  If you have any muscle tone in our arms it's not going to work for you.  If they would add a inch or two this would be a very nice hoodie.",B00029PKNQ
Fit well and my son-in-law really liked it--this was his Christmas gift.,B00029PKNQ
"Bought as a present, was not disappointed. Fits a bit small, but is warm and comfortable.",B00029PKNQ
"Fit Well. Could be made a bit bigger, though!",B00029PKNQ
Shrunk so much it's now useless,B00029PKNQ
I echo the comments that these run small. I bought the 3x and it fits exactly like a 2x hoodie from walmart.,B00029PKNQ
"This is a great sweatshirt, but order it a size large than you would normally wear.  The upper arm sleeves are tighter than expected.  I had toe exchange for the larger size, but a very warm and well made sweatshirt.  Recommend, but get a size bigger.",B00029PKNQ
Exactly what it said that it would be. Looking forward to purchasing more in the future!,B00029PKNQ
"It's a very nice thermal lined hoodie. My husband really likes it. We did order a size larger( large instead of medium) due to some comments in the other reviews, and I'm glad we did, because it fits nicely.",B00029PKNQ
"I like the hoodie itself, but it is way to small. I should've brought it two sizes bigger. I have to send it back.",B00029PKNQ
"It fits great, looks good, but the inside is white.  I ended up trying to spray dye it.",B00029PKNQ
"A little expensive, but worth it.",B00029PKNQ
"XL fit more like a mens large so had to exchange for bigger size. The 2xl-3xl fits as you would expect a mens XL to fit.  Sleeve cuffs are a little snug.  Father uses it for hunting.  He likes it for the style and type of camo, but we expected a roomier fit. He doesn't put it in the drier.",B00029PKNQ
"Just a little small should have went one size up, and I'm a thin guy. It's a very good quality sweatshirt though",B00029PKNQ
"I had to return the first one I got. I had ordered a 2xl and it fit like a large. So I reordered it as a 3xl. When it comes in, I'll update this review to say how it fits....hopefully it's not a tent and fits good.",B00029PKNQ
"great hoodie ,just be careful if you're huntin' whte tail ,'cause the inside is white",B00029PKNQ
"looked everywhere for a zip up camo sweatshirt and this was the perfect one. Great fit, washes terrific, no shrinkage.",B00029PKNQ
"Of course, everything has to be camo, but, the weight and protection this jacket allows is all he wants.  I have to get him a new one every time his old one wears out.",B00029PKNQ
"The sweatshirt itself was very nice it was the SIZE that was maddening........you only had it in a SMALL.
It would be fine for a young person  or a person who was VERY TINY.  I wanted it for myself for when we would go bike riding or walking.  It would be GREAT if it was the right size..........  I cannot stand anything tight around by back and shoulders when I am bike riding.  So it is still sitting in my room and not being used.",B00029PKNQ
"Zipper didn't work out of the box. I also normally wear large, but ordered XL after looking at reviews, and the back is still somewhat short, I constantly have to pull back of sweatshirt down to cover exposed waistband. Would've been a comfortable sweatshirt if I could use the zipper when it's cold and didn't have to struggle with the back. My recommendation is look elsewhere.",B00029PKNQ
"I really like how thick and warm it is, but sizing is a bit small. I'm 5'8"" 155 pounds and a large fits me like I'm 190 pounds. I have a few Rothco mock turtleneck shirts I got for work and they are a bit snug also. Otherwise, really good quality. Just get a size larger than you usually do.",B00029PKNQ
"Very warm! Sturdy material. Doesn't ""pill"" up like most of my jackets do. Only problem is that it could be a bit longer, but that's just my personal preference",B00029PKNQ
"It was what I  wanted,  but the zipper was hard to set, and the sweatshirt was frayed where the zipper started.",B00029PKNQ
"Several issues... arms are tight and short, sweatshirt is thin and worst is the entire inner lining is white which would look grungy in no time.  Too many down sides for the price they are asking.  Picture looks great... item is not what it appears to be.",B00029PKNQ
the body fit nicely but the arms where tight,B00029PKNQ
"My husband had this hoodie for over 10 years, so I bought this as a replacement! Great quality.",B00029PKNQ
"Usually wear a large, but I bought this as an extra large. It was still too small.",B00029PKNQ
The material and texture of the real thing looks very different from the posted image.,B00029PHMU
"Exactly what I wanted.  Thick, good quality",B00029PHMU
"Great belt! This thing is thick and sturdy (insert ""that's what she said"" joke). In all seriousness, this belt is perfect for most needs. I use mine to support my Condor battle belt and it holds like a champ. Just be sure to go over the size charts thoroughly. I bought one that was a bit too big for my waist, even when fully shortened; however, since I use this for a battle belt it fits just fine.",B00029PHMU
Bought 2 med for grandsons and was able to get them adjusted all the way down for my 6yr old after overlapping the adjustment. Will be buying myself one later.,B00029PHMU
Looks great and was as described.,B00029PHMU
"I chose this belt based on the good reviews.  It started to fall apart during initial adjustments.  It has the quality of an exhibition belt.  If you plan to go outdoors with it, you will regret it.  It does not appear to comply with the very basic quality standards of Rothco gear.",B00029PHMU
This is what I need for my tactical holster.,B00029PHMU
"Just like any other military belt, the price was right, it is a well made belt.",B00029PHMU
"was a bit small, but built like a tank.  gave it to my kid for his costume, and ordered the next size up",B00029PHMU
"Good belt....does the job....I was expecting an older WWII model, but this seems better.",B00029PHMU
"Belt functioned exactly as expected.  Not much more you can say then that, really.",B00029PHMU
bought it to hang my welding tools on so I don't have to go looking for them,B00029PHMU
"Wore it for 8 hours straight today, held up two full canteens and knife and holster w gun, no problems at all, hips are hurting a bit but I'm thinking I didn't have adjusted quite right.",B00029PHMU
"Very good material , heavy duty ! Will last long",B00029PHMU
"This was excellent for my ghostbuster costume. The pistol belt was something I had a harder time finding that would work with the costume, but this one was perfect for it.",B00029PHMU
Love it. Very sturdy. It was too small for my frame (I knew this when I ordered it) but I added a pistol belt extender and it fits great.,B00029PHMU
Use to hold my metal dieting stuff. Good quality.,B00029PHMU
Great item. It is fully adjustable  and can fit a big man. I like it.,B00029PHMU
Modern improvement on an old design. Allows for exact adjusting and will not slip. very durable. Good buy.,B00029PHMU
"great belt, great clips, great price, ultra heavy duty webbing.  I use it to hold a tool belt, 18v drill and full sized hammer . . . the buckle can come unclipped when bending over . . . I use a piece of single romex wire to ensure 100% locking when putting heavy load onto belt.",B00029PHMU
"The belt arrived as expected.
As most who have served in the military and used the pistol/web belt I like the snaps that has been added to hold it in place after waist adjustment.
I am using the ""Y"" harness instead of the ""H"" Harness.
I attached two black hawk 30 round mags using the molle attachments and I optioned to use alice clips.

I also attached a canteen and a right side holster.

I attached the new improved or expanded butt pack.",B00029PHMU
"Went to Burning Man 2013 (google it) and took this product with me, I loved it.

It looks great on almost any outfit, especially with boots. It attached carabiners to the rings on the belt, and easily had my cup, camera and other stuff hanging off it.",B00029PHMU
"This is exactly what it says it is; a military grade pistol belt. I bought it for a halloween costume, and it was exactly what I needed.

Recommended.",B00029PHMU
"This belt is solid, rugged, and durable. Doesn't fit thru my beltloops because it it too large, ot I would wear it with jeans. Holds my .45 like a champ.",B00029PHMU
"I got this for our weekend hikes to carry our water canteen works great not cheap looks great ,many colors",B00029PHMU
"This is exactly what I was looking for.  Brand new, flexible, size adjustable.  Bought one for wife, brother, mother, and sister!",B00029PHMU
Terrible belt. Upon receiving it I immoderate it'll tried I on and the adjustable sizing clips broke off. I put them back on but they will not stay in place.,B00029PHMU
Sturdy! Great price The belt is the great military quality as issued in basic training!!!!!! Worth every penny and would buy another,B00029PHMU
Many of these descriptions fail to mention that the belt must not be too large for the belt loops. So exactly how wide is this belt ?,B00029PHMU
"This is a latter day product to upgrade the WWII original. I like all the improvements except the size adjustment method which employs a claw clamp device to secure the adjustment end. I prefer the older, more secure method of eye hooks BUT this one is completely adquate and does an acceptable job. Haven't tested it under field conditions yet but expect it will pass with flying colors.",B00029PHMU
"I should of ordered a large ha, but it still fits me. I love it. I'll buy it again for my next kit",B00029PHMU
excellent belt. very strong. i ordered the large since at the time it said 42-44 waist. it did fit but was very tight. the belt is a strong belt but adjusting the length is time consuming. i hook my LC-2 to it and some small packs and water packs along with a holster and magazine pouch. it handled all very comfortably.,B00029PHMU
Soft and comfortable while strong and sturdy!,B00029PHMU
Exactly as described. Good price.,B00029PHMU
Perfect.  Size was as described. Good quality,B00029PHMU
"So far, it has held up to (infrequent) light duty use. But I can see where the thinner plastic on the quick-release buckles could be a weak point if a lot of gear was clipped on, or with repeated bending forward and putting strain on the belt was done.

It serves my purposes for now, but it the buckles don't seem as sturdy as some USGI surplus belts (in OD) that I have.",B00029PHMU
Seems pretty heavy duty. I purchased this for a cotume for my 10 year old. He's about 62 lbs and 4'5 and I was able to get it small enough to fit his waist. It will work well for what we need. I wouldn't buy it as a regular belt though even for an adult,B00029PHMU
"Very nice and confort jacket. All seasons. Not heavy. Very light, if I want another jacket in the future, I' ll go for something the same.  Thanks",B00029PKKY
"Just recieved the parka, very very happy with the product. Size-wise. I am pretty large 6/4-280. I bought the xxl and it fits great. Not tight by any means. very comfortable. Very large heavy duty zipper. Zipper is kind of sticky which just a rub witth a bar of soap will take care of that. Buttons that hold the zipper cover should have been changed to velcro but still ok. I cannot really find anything negative about this coat. I am happy. I bought the black. really nice",B00029PLHQ
"The temperatures here haven't yet dropped enough for me to evaluate the warmth of this parka in frigid conditions but I had to leave it unzipped on a 20F day. I was perspiring even with it unzipped. I took the advice of other reviewers and bought a size smaller than I normally wear and the new coat fits well.

The buttons need more stitches before I'll trust them to stay where they belong. (The parka arrived with extra buttons and snaps. I put them in the sleeve pocket so they won't end up forgotten in a drawer when I need them.) I found a couple of dozen threads dangling from various places and snipped them off and touched their ends to a flame to limit future raveling. I also noticed a few bits of fluff here and there which probably came from the poly-fill insulation. It's too early to tell if the fluff was picked up during the manufacturing process or if it will be an ongoing problem.

The outer shell makes a noise when I swing my arms but I don't plan to sneak up on anyone so it's not really a con. I rubbed the zipper on a candle I keep for that purpose. It made the zipper work more smoothly.

Being mindful of my beard while doing so, I pulled the zipper to its upper limit. The result was extreme tunnel vision. It certainly justifies the prominent use of the work snorkel in the description. No wind will reach a wearer's face with the zipper fully up. (As a 64 year old, I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that the first thing that popped into my head was the parka wearing cartoon character named Kenny from Comedy Central's South Park television program. The unfortunate Kenny dies in each episode. Crossing a busy street wearing this parka in full-snorkel mode could easily lead to the wearer's demise unless his head pivots like an owl's.)

One feature puzzles me. There's an adjustable strap on the back of the snorkel hood. If anyone can clue me in regarding its purpose, I'd be grateful.

While I truly hope I won't have the chance to test this parka in severe weather, I'm confident it will keep me warm.",B00029PLHQ
"I bought this parka from another retailer. I first ordered a 3X size thinking that I would like to add additional layers for better comfort in the bitter North Dakota winters here. When I received the 3X size, (my normal coat size), I couldn't button or zip it on. I returned it to the company from which it came, and ordered a 5X size. This fit fine, but after only minimum use for one winter it now fits tight as well. I does perform well here in -40 (wind chill) temperatures, has plenty of pocket space, and is all around a great coat.",B00029PLHQ
"I've been looking for this jacket for a very long, long time. My husband is on the bigger side, so it's very hard to find a jacket to keep him warm when we're working outdoors.

I'm glad I kept looking !!!!!!!

Super job !!!!",B00029PLHQ
"Great jacket. Runs larger than your regular size, but good if you gona have layers inside. Well made zipper but the stichings on the buttons seem a bit week. Awesome jacket at the end, specially for the price.",B00029PLHQ
I love the quality and metal zipper. Very strong!,B00029PLHQ
"I ordered this parka online. I started to wear the parka during a cold spell. It was extremely warm, however the Quality of the jacket is questionable. I only wore the parka 4 times & 1 or the loops already came off.  The zipper is terrible even though I used a wax candle to help it. I can see that this parka will be a ONE SEASON coat, if that. The manufacturer Rothco should be ashamed of producing such an inferior product. I would seriously suggest to the buying public that they stay clear of this product.",B00029PLHQ
"It is WARM & well made. The fur lining is a little chintzy... but the micro fleece lining of the hood makes up for that. My man loves the color, the drawstring waist cincher, and all the pockets. Its a FABULOUS manly gift to give!!!",B00029PLHQ
"I ordered this because I thought the winter was going to be colder than usual.  I was right.  When I got it, I almost sent it back because my wife thought it was too thin to be warm.  Was she wrong!!!  At twenty below zero with a wind child of forty below zero, you will be warm.  I was.

The only problem was that the zipper tore at the base, and I was only able to button the coat, which it was still warm enough.  I did buy another of a different color, as the black was a bit more acceptable to wear as a businessperson.  I will buy one of these coats every fall for the rest of my life.  What a great value.",B00029PLHQ
"I love this style of coat and had purchased an XL years before from Sportsmans Guide.  It fit well, but it was almost gold in color.  I decided to take the plunge and purchase an XL in black for around town,  these jackets are very nice to wear in the car to work, as they are not too bulky.  My XL black came today and IT IS HUGE.  I look like I have gained a few pounds when I am wearing this.  The hood is also much larger then my gold SG one.
The company's return policy is 15 % restocking fee.  That and postage...I'll keep it for that.  Too bad though, they are nice jackets.",B00029PLHQ
"This coat is very warm and the price was unbeatable.  I use as a work coat outside so it had to be tough.  This coat is tough as well as warm.  The price was great and I am very happy with the fit and finish.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a tough, warm coat at a great price.",B00029PLHQ
"This jacket is 4 sizes larger than stated. Size S = XXL + big belly. This is enough to lower the assessment.
Nightmare.",B00029PLHQ
"the left pocket has a whole in it & its brand new ???? I'm gonna take it to a dry cleaner & get pocket fixed & re-support the buttons. Alot of feedback complains about buttons falling off. That said,awesome jacket & even more awesome price LOVE IT !",B00029PLHQ
Excellent. Just what I wanted. It's like the one I had back in the 70's that I wore for years. Good  construction and a heavy duty metal zipper.,B00029PLHQ
"The jacket was a piece of crap.  It was a very thin, badly produced copy.  Cheap zippers and the fur on the hood looked like a balding old rabbit with patches of fur that had undergone a bad hair replacement regimen",B00029PLHQ
"I wore this type parka on an Army flight line in Nuremberg, West Germany. for two winters.  I really like it then and thought I'd buy the Rothco version.  I've been wearing it sporadically now for about a month in Cincinnati, Ohio, but it hasn't gotten really cold here yet this fall.  I would agree with other reviewers that the parka is about one size too large.  I normally wear a 42 reg, but went down to a medium, which fits fine with plenty of room for layering underneath.  The outer fabric is heavy duty nylon, but is rather crinkly.  It seems to be quieting down and mellowing out with use.  The fabric seems to be very water resistant.  The parka has thin  insulation, but seems quite warm and it's easy to move around in for work or recreation.  I like the way it looks, but my nostalgia surely plays a role in that.  Other reviewers suggest that their buttons fell off, but the buttons on my parka seem to be well attached.  Maybe Rothco fixed that problem.  The fake coyote fur is rather skimpy, just like the one I wore in Germany five decades ago.  Overall, the parka seems like a very good value,  well built, and apparently durable.  I would recommend the parka.",B00029PLHQ
Nice parka but not up to what I expected - already have a hole in pocket from keys,B00029PLHQ
I thought I was buying an Ultra Force N3B parka in sage. I got a large fitting plastic Rothco parka in more of a hunter green. I would suggest spending a little more and getting some other product.,B00029PLHQ
"Great parka. Be ready to take the buttons off and resew them, but the issued one was the same way.",B00029PLHQ
"This LOOKS like the old Air Force Parka, but it ain't. Far thinner, lighter and not nearly as warm. Buttons are poorly sewn, see other reviews, they do run large, order a size down. This is fine for layering, they run large so that's not a problem. It is an ok light weight coat, but it is not even close to the original military issue made for subzero weather. Shell is 100% Nylon, Lining 100% Polyester, Interlining 100% Synthetic Fiber, Synthetic Fur Trimming...and labeled Dry Clean ONLY. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone dealing with extreme cold weather or that wants a Parka like the AF issued.",B00029PLHQ
"These are really great suspenders. I really like the 2"" wide straps. Very easy to put on and take off. They are made very well so you can't go wrong. Nice to have my britches at waste level instead of below my 6 pack !",B00029PH4I
"Disappointed with the product, because the gator clamps wil not hold. One clamp on the back will not hold and the adjustment clamps  will not engage.",B00029PH4I
Great suspenders at a great price.,B00029PH4I
"Good suspenders, well made, strong clasps. Color was dead on, I expect to get many years of use from this product.",B00029PH4I
These are just typical suspenderes.,B00029PH4I
"Ok, but too short for a 6' man.",B00029PH4I
"I searched in vain for a pair of MultiCam Camo Suspenders without success. These Rothco OD Green ones blend pretty well with the MultiCam Gear I have so I pretty well pleased. They are not expensive, especially compared to some of the ""Boutique"" brands, most of which aren't really any better than these. All the hardware is a matte black rather than completely non-tactical polished silver or brass hardware most suspenders come with. As I just received these I've not developed any opinions as to the how long these will last.",B00029PH4I
"People with slender waistlines often have trouble keeping their pants above their hips. These suspenders work well, and are decorative to boot.",B00029PH4I
This product is great and fits well under the uniform.  I love wearing suspenders versus a belt.  And they are comfortable.,B00029PH4I
My daddy loves these! He's like a different person when he wears them!,B00029PH4I
"From the time I started wearing these, I would say they lasted about 1 1/2 to 2 years of use before one of the metal clips broke apart. If I had been able to find all of the clip pieces I may have been able to jerry rig it back together but really, why bother (your time is worth something after all). I did like the camo pattern on these suspenders and have no real complaints about them other then the lack of durability. If you purchase these I wouldn't necessarily expect them to be a long term investment.",B00029PH4I
The picture is very misleading. You do not get the THREE suspenders shown. No where does it say how many you get. Someone may think they are buying all three.,B00029PH4I
Works as expected. I use it to hold up motorcycle pants. Quality seems fine so far. The size is adjustable as normal suspenders are.,B00029PH4I
"These are super heavy duty suspenders.  I got them for my Tru-Spec Gen-1 & Gen-2 H2O proof trousers and they work great!  They're wider than normal suspenders which means they won't be digging into your shoulders and they stay attached without a problem, not once in the years I've had them have they popped off.

Most definitely recommend if you need something other than a belt to hold your pants or trousers up.",B00029PH4I
Originally got these for a costume party because they are pretty cheap and on Amazon Prime. After receiving them however they turned out to be of pretty awesome quality. The only gripe I have is that the clips on the suspenders could have been made a bit better.,B00029PH4I
They do what they are supposed to do in a quiet way.  Not garish just hardworking.  Good elastic and clips are black not silver.,B00029PH4I
"This is a cute little canvas bag that resembles a saddle bag or canteen bag, only smaller.  It's not much larger than a cd case, and it's about as deep as my iPhone is wide.  Very economical use of space.

It holds everything I need to get through my day with room to spare.  I have systemic lupus, and I use a cane and forget things.  This bag is small enough and comfortable enough for me to put it on in the morning and wear it all day without having to take it off the way you'd set down a purse or briefcase.  Which is good.  Because I've lost all my purses, and I am beholden to the kindness of more than one stranger for the fact that I still have my briefcase.

This bag is shorter, deeper, and less well-organized than the Venturer Travel Portfolio, which makes it better for some applications (it leaves extra room for a camera and allows the use of one's ""real"" wallet).  The cellphone pocket is roomy enough for the smartest smartphones and multimedia devices.  It closes with velcro, and it's right up front.  I love that.

And despite the less organized feel to the bag, it still works great for someone who needs to have one hand free (for driving, walking with a child, walking a dog).

I'm glad I have both of these little bags.",B00029R7Y6
The details on this bag do not include the total dimensions for the bag.  It only talks about the pockets.  Will someone who owns this bag please state what the overall dimensions are?  Thanks.,B00029R7Y6
"Me and my husband both took this bag on our honeymoon to the Mediterranean and we loved the bag!  We went to Italy, Greece and Turkey and this bag went everywhere with us on all the excursions.  We went to tons of ruins and hiked everywhere and this bag held up great! It was great to just sling over my chest and keep safe close to me plus all the compartments were amazing! It could hold so much and there was a nice compartment for my camera that kept it ready for any pictures. I would recommend this to anyone going on any kind of trip.  We definitely plan to take our bags on any future trips we take. Thanks to company for making such a great quality product!!",B00029R7Y6
"I used this bag when we went to Egypt. It kept everything I needed without the extra weight of a purse. Plus, the color made it look like safari gear, which was cool.

My only complaint was the enormous size of the cell phone holder. No one has cell phones that big anymore! I used it to hold sunglasses instead.",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this for my husband who is always giving me his ""stuff"" to carry in my purse...or he hauls around a few things in a plastic grocery bag when we head to the cottage.

I wasn't sure he'd actually like carrying a bag, but he loves it and wishes he'd had it sooner.

It is big enough to hold his checkbook size wallet, his glasses, pen and other small things he needs routinely.  There are several pockets and inner compartments and it's easy to organize everything to find things easily.

It's rugged looking and he feels comfortable slinging it cross shoulder bag style for handsfree carrying when he's out.

Now everything is within reach and he doesn't need to ask me to find his glasses or wallet in my cluttered bag!",B00029R7Y6
"This organizer is exactly what I have been looking for and thus far has worked out very well for me. It hold all my essentials neatly and I don't have to leave the house thinking that I forgot something, like my glasses, change purse, lip balm, or medication dispenser. Note: I found the review and video by skyforce95 to be very helpful in explaining all the details of this organizer. One thing I can add refers to the small pouch pocket next to the pen, which I use for lip balm and my medication dispenser. These are small and light enough so that they do not cause the Velcro closure  to pop open, since it does not close very tightly. For the items mentioned above, it has stayed closed for me. If I notice that it weakens, I plan on replacing the hook and loop closure with a higher strength type, which is more aggressive. (I have used it in the past at work and it was called High Tech Hook and Loop) This can be found at Amazon, Walmart or hardware stores.

Note: I found the review and video by skyforce95 to be very helpful in explaining all the details of this organizer.",B00029R7Y6
falling apart on to the next bag,B00029R7Y6
Great bag plenty of room for a Flip phone with a carrying case in the front pouch. Army Olve drab so it is masculine and the old man I bought it for loves it.,B00029R7Y6
So versatile I had to order two more for friends.,B00029R7Y6
"Bought this for an older guy friend as a gift and he loves it, mostly because it has rugged more male appearance for a ""man purse"" so to speak. Fits everything he needs when he goes to the gym or traveling or a quick trip out and about without overloading his pockets which he hates to do. Highly recommend it for both value, durability and appearance. Should however have a couple of color choices.",B00029R7Y6
Hi quality good product for tactical and travel and duties,B00029R7Y6
"Sturdy bag, but smaller than I expected. My 6 year old uses this as a ""travel bag"" for toys and games. He fits quite a bit in it, but all fairly small things. It has two pockets with a zipper - one has a little more width than the other. He fits a GameboyDS, some pens, games, and tiny toys in here for a day out and about. He can't fit a journal (notebook) in here which sometimes makes him use another bag. I can see this being good use if you know your items will not exceed the size of the bag. The quality is great. The color is pretty true to the picture. The strap is adjustable and has been secure. Other than size... we like this bag.",B00029R7Y6
It is nice but I thought it would be bigger.,B00029R7Y6
"Way smaller than expected. I bought this hoping i could use it to carry my very small sketchbook, and even though it fit within the listed measurements theres atleast 2 inches sticking out of this bag.",B00029R7Y6
Great bag! Don't leave home without it.,B00029R7Y6
Love everything about this bag except that after about 6 months one of the zippers only zips about half the time.,B00029R7Y6
"Getting a lot of use out of this little bag. Fits an iPhone 6+, wallet, sunglasses, flashlight, multitool, pen, small notebook, and assorted other items. Sturdy construction, no zipper or strap failures yet. Haven't worn it on the belt, but two large belt straps on the back are there if you need them. Sub-Man Bag size. Very pleased.",B00029R7Y6
"Light and compact, yet has enough space for some useful items such as your phone, a pocket point-&-shoot camera, notepad, small note-pad, pens, wallet, the obligatory selfie-stick, and a multi-tool.",B00029R7Y6
Love this bag.  Use it all weekend.  perfect for yard sales and shopping.  I can keep what I need close to me and available without lugging around my heavy purse.  Love it!,B00029R7Y6
"Well made, useful for carrying phone and small wallet, perfect for airports and travel, not large enough for small tablet.",B00029R7Y6
"I received the Rothco Excursion Organizer bag recently and am very pleased with the purchase.  This is the second one I have purchased, so I knew what I was getting.  For my purposes, it offers substantial functionality in a compact design (lots of pockets and compartments of various sizes).  I appreciate the belt loops in addition to the shoulder strap.  The one I purchased previously has held up nicely, although under only intermittent use.  I hope this one does the same.",B00029R7Y6
"This damn bag. I've had it twice- the first time it was good for a while and then the zippers started breaking. The second one, both main zippers broke quickly (in the way where they'll keep zipping back and forth but the little teeth aren't aligned and it won't close), the pull fell off the front zipper, and then when I was trying to fix one of the main zippers, the actual metal grabber part snapped in half. Never had that one happen before. Finally just threw it away. I have had three Rothco products (this bag twice and a backpack) and I love the design but they are just crap. So frustrating. Bought a similar bag from a different brand this time around.",B00029R7Y6
"This bag is for my husband and it is a good sized bag for daily use....not too large and not too small.  It's perfect for holding all the necessities of daily life: wallet, phone, keys, cards, glasses, sunglasses, small pill holders, etc.  It's also rugged and can take a lot of wear and tear.  The shoulder strap is a nice (but potentially optional) feature.  I'm not sure if my husband will keep it attached or not.  He seems to like the bag a lot.",B00029R7Y6
I would rather have a black one.  Not availble in black.,B00029R7Y6
"Great.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Needed something to carry my junk, (cell phone wallets etc) when I'm wearing shorts or pants with too few pockets.  Fits the bill perfectly.",B00029R7Y6
Nicely made and very convenient pockets...,B00029R7Y6
"The size was no where near the listed size. Over all the bag was nicely done, well padded and nice looking but it was too small.",B00029R7Y6
Its good I like it. All my friend  likes it too,B00029R7Y6
"this is my second bag like it very much, I cut the strap back and use it as a hand carry.",B00029R7Y6
"This is the perfect size bag for a man and has room for everything I use to stuff in my pants. The space for my i-Phone is great, and perhaps now I will not lose another phone in a taxi, as I have done on several occasions.",B00029R7Y6
"The bag is pretty good, nice size, the phone pocket is a bit of a throwback, but I could live with that, what really ticked me off, was that the strap broke, or more specifically the swivel portion of the end of the strap, it seems like some cheap die-cast aluminum and just failed at the connector, I wasn't even carrying much in the bag, so it wasn't overloaded.",B00029R7Y6
The strap is too short for me. But then again - I am a big guy.,B00029R7Y6
Good quality materials. Nice stitching with no loose threads. Very nice color. Plenty of room for all sorts of daily carry items.,B00029R7Y6
I bought this for may day as a xmas gift 2 years ago. It is still in use and he loved it,B00029R7Y6
"Just what I was looking for. It fits my Kindle Paperwhite a tad tightly but the zipper still closes. I carry an old android phone as a music player with a headset in the back pocket. Very nice, good feel to the fabric. The strap is made of the same fabric which makes me wonder about it's longevity. Overall, I lake it and would recommend it.",B00029R7Y6
"I was a bit worried when I ordered this item as this is my first murse.  However, I am completely pleased with all aspects of it.  The compartment sizes are perfect for everything I need.  And yet, it is small enough in size that I don't feel like I am carrying my wife's purse around.  It lays against my side and I don't even notice it most of the time.

It is made of good durable material and seems to hold up well to use and wear.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an easy way to carry everyday pocket items without having pockets.",B00029R7Y6
Great bag . I use it for work. It holds everything I need to carry. Looks good too.,B00029R7Y6
wonderful product exactly as described very pleased with description of product will recommend two friends,B00029R7Y6
"Bought this bag at a surplus store - looking for something that ""doesn't look like a purse"" that could carry my daily essentials when I'm not wearing a jacket.

This fits the bill, holding a cell phone charger + cable, field notes notebook, pen, small digital camera (ricoh grd 4), and other essentials. I clip my keychain with carabiner onto the strap. Gets all the bulk out of my pockets, and gives me easy access to my camera for street photography.",B00029R7Y6
Cell phone pocket is really small and does not hold my Samsung,B00029R7Y6
The bag was perfect in every other way except too small...,B00029R7Y6
It's not as useful as I'd hoped. The external pockets (pen and mobile phone(?)) are smaller than I'd hoped.,B00029R7Y6
forth one I have gotten over the years,B00029R7Y6
The ear hooks on this feel terrible.,B00029R7Y6
"This is the second one of these I have bought. The first  I returned because  the metal  hardware attaching the strap to the bag broke.  The same thing happened  and I a a few weeks outside of the return  window. What a waste of money. I will not be ordering these again, nor buying  from this vendor.",B00029R7Y6
Good back-up pair of sunglasses.,B00029R7Y6
"Just the right size for the few items I need to have with me, like credit cards, keys, money, etc.  This bag is well made and should hold up for many years.",B00029R7Y6
"I'm not a huge fan of stylish purses, so several months ago I ordered a messenger bag from Rothco.  It was amazing quality but it was far too big!  I purchased this because it was similar in size to a purse I have that just barely fits all my things in it.  I was worried because the measurements reflected that it's slightly smaller than my former purse, but I love it.  It's small but roomy-- there are so many pockets that space isn't an issue.  It fits my wallet, keys, phone, memo book, cardholder, digital camera, and various small items with plenty of room to spare!  I like that it has belt loops so you can wear it as a fanny pack, although I'll probably just use the shoulder strap.  Overall I am so pleased.  I had high expectations after receiving an amazing messenger bag from Rothco, and somehow I'm still blown away by the quality, value, and durability of their products.",B00029R7Y6
Too small but gave to daughter she loved it great material,B00029R7Y6
The size fits just right to what I need like for Diabetes kit. It will fit in another bag for longer travel or I'll just carry it by itself for a quick run.,B00029R7Y6
"Nice, but way TOO small.. Sorry!",B00029R7Y6
Did not have proper size on web site gave it away,B00029R7Y6
"Got it for my trip to vegas, and it works great.",B00029R7Y6
"Good quality bag made of  rugged canvas material. For my planned use, it is too small. But I could envision using it for other things.  If they offered it in a 9"" by 8"" by 4"" size, it would be great.",B00029R7Y6
It is fit for a KID! only ONE STAR.,B00029R7Y6
WELL MADE... ZIPPERS ARE EASY TO OPERATE ..POCKET WILL FIT A PPK 380.. IT WILL HOLD IPHONE 5...,B00029R7Y6
"I purchased this to accommodate my iPhone 6 Plus.  Works just fine.  I keep the phone in the main compartment along with my Anker external battery, charger, adapter and money.  It's a perfect fit for my needs.",B00029R7Y6
"The bag itself was good quality,, but I had ordered two; one black and this one in green.  They were Christmas gifts for brothers to use as ""exploring and detective bags.""  I received a black instead of the green that I had ordered.  I had to give it to him anyway.  He is too young to understand that one of his gifts needed returned.",B00029R7Y6
very small! smaller than i expected.,B00029R7Y6
"small, easy to use and holds a lot of diabetic supplies.  It's great!  I can take my supplies with me easier.",B00029R7Y6
"Exactly as advertised.  Just what I needed.  Perfect for carrying a few small items.  Cell phone or wallet fits perfectly front pocket making it easily accessible.  Two other larger pockets in the body of the bag great for sunglasses, pillboxes, lotion, sanitizer, compact, etc.  Only large enough to carry a few small necessities.",B00029R7Y6
"This is a very convenient ""man-purse"" that I use for my wallet, cellphone, sunglasses etc, when cycling to work.  Unexpected feature was the number of inner and outer pockets for keeping things organized.",B00029R7Y6
"I like it,but it's too small for what I want it for.",B00029R7Y6
Nothing fits in it.  I need something that can hold my wallet and phone.  This does neither.,B00029R7Y6
it is ok I was looking for something smaller easy to carry around but this is ok.,B00029R7Y6
Work's great for coceal weapon 38;) fits just finewith easy access,B00029R7Y6
"I really love this bag, but I unfortunately received a faulty strap. One of the hinge springs seems painted so instead of locking in place, it locks in the open position and falls off.

Because it was purchased as a gift for me, it fell outside the Rothco warranty. I've got three of their bags now and not sure how to handle the $8 cost of a replacement strap or if I'll just keep shuffling my good straps around.",B00029R7Y6
Bag seems to be fine.  Was just smaller than what I needed.,B00029R7Y6
"I love the various pockets on this bag!!!!  I was able to add a phone, my SCS controller, a pair of sunglasses, pens/pencils and a small writing tablet.  It was a bit large, but not a real concern.  Unfortunately, the main zipper broke, and Amazon refunded the price of my purchase.  I am debating on whether to chance buying another one.",B00029R7Y6
"I got this for my son so he could carry his wallet, Nintendo, phone, and assorted other small but valuable items back and forth, and when we're out and about. He had been carrying things in the pockets of his hoodie, but he kept losing things. This bag is much more secure, and holds everything he needs in one place. So far he hasn't lost anything since starting to use this bag. It is absolutely the right size for a few small items. Definitely recommend.",B00029R7Y6
"Perfect for phone,pens, makeup etc... I bought it for my husband but kept it for myself after he said he wanted leather",B00029R7Y6
I choose I like because that bag is confort to me!!!,B00029R7Y6
"The bag is very well made and I am happy about the quality. It is smaller than advertised though as I ordered a 8X6.5 and the actual dimensions are: ASIN: B005NBZ8OO
Product Dimensions: 7.5 x 6.1 x 1.9 inches; 10.6 ounces as indicated at the bottom of the description. The difference is noticeable with a tape measure. It works for me but there is no extra room for my needs. It gets a 4 star due to the size.",B00029R7Y6
"I carried my black bag every day for a year. Even at work I sit at my desk with it over my shoulder. It is worn out. Cloth teared, metal details start to fail. But I am happy as it was serving me well with great convenience - to work, on shopping, visiting friends, camping. So I bought a green bag now. And it is the same style, and it seems same quality, same pockets and size. Taking into account it is hard to find the right bag I am buying 2 extra to use later when this one wears away again.

Big thanks to manufacturer!",B00029R7Y6
"I use this bag every day. It holds my wallet, knife, phone, keys and paper and a pen.  For whay you pay it is a lot of bang for the buck.  My big complaint is the velcro on the phone cover is very weak and the phone comes out all the time so now I slide it in the front side zipper pocket.  I wish someone made a better quality version of this bag I would buy it in a second. In the mean time it does everything I need and we will see for how long.",B00029R7Y6
"if your looking for a bag to fit all of what a man would need this is the bag. it fits perfect, I have my wallet, vapor smoker, keys, cell phone cig's, knife, all that I used to carry in my pockets. on top of that every day stuff it carries any thing I might need if I get stuck or stranded away from home like flash light, extra batt. a leatherman all in one tool, matches, two lighters, magnifying glass, compass, whistle, survival do all tool, fishing tackle, para cord, mylar blanket, marker, tooth picks, p38, p52, 6 foot tape measure, snares, and a pistol just in case. so you see even when some guys at work or wear ever has something to say about it I will be the one they come to if anything happens. great bag. Thanks for reading",B00029R7Y6
"Just what my husband needed.  He has always used one that fit on his belt, but it needed to have a lot of room.  This one fit the bill.  It isn't real large, but packs a lot of useable space.  Perfect!",B00029R7Y6
"Breat little bag.  Perfect for my use.  Nice heavy cotton material, plenty of cool pockets.  Buy it if you need a small bag for small gear.",B00029R7Y6
"While I absolutely love the utility of the bag the handle ripped off at the very first use. It looked sturdy and I used it for international travel. I was able to fit in 3 passports, a wallet in the main pouch. My iPhone in the front slot and a pen which is very convenient to fill forms etc. I hope this was a one off case since I do like the bag very much.",B00029R7Y6
"Perfect for little excursions.  I need to carry an epi-pen and a pill case, as well as my phone and wallet.  It's a tight squeeze but it all fits.  Light too.  And I can attach my own strap.",B00029R7Y6
"This was too small to fit my tablet, mobile phone, keys, and wallet.  It was my error in not studying its dimensions.",B00029R7Y6
These are cheap sunglasses. the ear wire is stiff as hell so u gotta bend it. But it's fine. I've owned probably 10 pairs through the years bc I love the shape and width. They're great shades for the price. Rock& roll baby.,B00029R7Y6
"Purchased this as a gift for a lady who tears through purses like tissue, but does not like those fancy bags that cost a small fortune.  Plenty of organizers inside and out.  It seems quite well made and quite sturdy...time will tell.  A real bargain for those not wanting fashion or a fancy name.",B00029R7Y6
"A bit small but wear has broken it in. It us really worn because I'm rough with it, and so may have to order another soon. 2 nites ago a gentleman or the job saw it. He asked where did I get it. Well the cat's out of the bag. He'll be order too. Great bag. Nifty compartments. Blood pressure cuff, SpO2, pens, pen lights, cell-phones, derringers(sorry). Great bag fellas....MLJ",B00029R7Y6
"I ordered this because of the size, in one direction it was suppose to be 8 inches which would have accommodated my Kindle (just under 7 inches)  without a problem.  However, it's a bit on the short side and with a struggle it will zip closed.  Maybe in time it will stretch.  Otherwise it offers a lot of pockets for phone, pen, notepad, ID, money and more.",B00029R7Y6
"As a handicap man, I needed something small to carry eye glasses, magnifing glass and a couple of other things to make my life easier. This bag is great.",B00029R7Y6
But small outside cell ph pocket won't hold larger size smart phone ph like my Samsung. My DayMinder book won't fit in the bag. Smart Phone pocket on outside but should be a little bigger I want easy access to cell phone!  I always have a canvas man purse so I know how it should be made. This is a Small man purse which doesn't masculinize it.,B00029R7Y6
Got for trip to Disney.  The metal pin that holds strap to bag broke.  Ended up carrying the bag the whole trip.  Keep looking.,B00029R7Y6
"I am diabetic and I have hypertension so I take 7 different medicines daily plus must use testing supplies. I needed a bag or something to keep all of my medicines and testing supplies together and always handy. I ran across this little case which came in two sizes on Amazon. I opted for the larger one, [the excursion organizer]. This pouch came in different colors, red, blue, green, brown etc., so, being a male, I chose the brown because it did not look like a purse and it reminded me of my old army gear. This bag cost me fifteen dollars or so and I can get all of my medical gear in it and take it everywhere I go. This thing is very well built, very handy, very cheap and very cool.",B00029R7Y6
"Have one that I acquired from unknown sources. Found that item so useful, I purchased another.  The organizer will come in handy on today's walk for the animals.",B00029R7Y6
"I got this travel bag for my son, on his school trip to Boston, he said some of his friends liked it and asked where did he buy it, Of Course he said AMAZON.....its strong and durable, many inside pockets...yes people go ahead buy it........",B00029R7Y6
"Ok, works great the zippers work great and the strap will go to different lengths. I recommend this product. price was perfect",B00029R7Y6
"Ordered so that I could place small items into, that I  would normally just through into my pack. This small bag worked out perfect .
The material and zippers were of good quality.",B00029R7Y6
nice size. zippers work well. seems well made although i haven't used it much as of yet. i think i will get a few more for gifts. i think it is great. a good value.,B00029R7Y6

"It's exactly what I needed....and expected. Solid construction. I hated carrying my keys, cell phone, wallet, and anything else in my pockets. This is a perfect ""man bag""!",B00029R7Y6
"Excellent size, smaller than most but don't be fooled.  Gets a little heavy holding big ring of keys, double size wallet, camera, phone, pen etc.  Have not tried on belt yet this Winter but will do so in Spring.  Has 2 wide loops in rear that will fit most any size belt.  Strong material which I will spray with waterproofing.  For the important ""man"" who needs to carry things but does not want to look like he is carrying a purse/murse as it is smaller than most offered but big enough.",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he loves it. It is a perfect size to carry around what he needs. The front pocket is big enough for a smart phone, and the bag looks manly enough to where he doesn't mind wearing it around.",B00029R7Y6
"Bought it as a bag to keep cell phone/keys/wallet on my person at the gym without interfering with the workout. Great for intended purpose. I wear it as a cross-body 'mini messenger'. Also holds ear buds (my AnyTime has treadmills with mini-tv but no sound or close caption) and micro-fiber towel (my AnyTime has only the paper variety.) Well-made, small (as expected) and surprisingly soft.",B00029R7Y6
"Gave it to my mentor who serve in the Korean War. He loved it. He didn't think it was feminine, said it reminded him of an old medic bag during the war. He keeps raving about it! Good buy. Has lots of pockets for his keys, wallet, shoulder straps if hes tired of carrying it, sunglasses, etc...",B00029R7Y6
"I have had this bag now for more than a year. It is excellent. I have cancer and it allows me to conveniently to carry everything I need with me. Pills, glasses, etc. It also allows me to retain my masculine self image in the process. Others have noticed and commented positively on the appearance.",B00029R7Y6
Just what I needed. Having to carry many items in my pockets while working was uncomfortable. This bag was the ticket. I have everything I need within reach and I am not ruining my clothes.,B00029R7Y6
Cute bag. It was a little smaller than I thought it would be. But it will be  great to travel with. Lots of zippers and pockets and not too big that it will weight you down. Perfect for the traveling essentials.,B00029R7Y6
"Just what I've been looking for as an ammo bag. Holds Many spare mags and a couple boxes of ammo. Pencil pocket fits a sharpie well but I use it for my small AA mag-light, fits very tight but it fits. Metal clips and D-rings should hold up well.",B00029R7Y6
"I like the bag a lot.  I like all the pockets. It is small. It will not hold a kindle or ipad. It holds just the right amount, wallet, keys, checkbook, glasses, and cell phone. Maybe a couple more things.",B00029R7Y6
The interior pockets are pretty much useless if you have anything in the pockets that they're in.  Otherwise it works.,B00029R7Y6
"I love it ! It's just the right size for me. And there's a place for everything.
I've had three and when I need a new one,I'll order again.",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this for my husband to have his wallet, glasses, keys all in one place. It is sturdy, compact and fits nice cross body. Most of all he likes it!",B00029R7Y6
"It beats putting everything in you pockets and weighting your pants to the ground. It carries my wallet, cellphone, notebook and pen.diabetes tablets and hearing aid case.",B00029R7Y6
"Hubby had tendency to always forget ""something"" when we leave house..  Now he puts everything in this bag & attaches it to his belt.  Just grab & go.

Liked it so well, I ordered a second bag for our son.  Now he can always have his camera etc. with him as well.",B00029R7Y6
"I got this for my father who is 90 years old and kept dropping stuff out of his pockets.  This works great, it's not big at all and its very easy for him to unzip the pockets to get into. It keeps his wallet, reading glasses, cell phone, medications, and a pen secure and in one place.  If you know an older man who keeps losing stuff because it slides out of his pockets this is a nice solution.",B00029R7Y6
"great if you want to look like some bug-eyed insect, but not for a normal sized head . . .",B00029R7Y6
"PERFECT! very well constructed, the size is just what I was looking for. I keep my keys and wallet as well as my phone and a few other items.",B00029R7Y6
"It's very hard to find a bag for men that are neither too sportly or too tourist oriented. This bag is the exact size for all the crap I carry around and it even has spare room if I want to carry some more. It looks pretty strongly built and has a pocket for everything. It can even carry a book (not an enormous one, but still)! I really love it and I've read in other comments that the cellphone space on the front was too small for a smartphone, but my huawei in its protection (similar to an Iphone) fits and even has spare room for accessories.

A great buy for a guy that needs a bag that you can carry around, even in drunken nights, without the fear of losing it or to take a book in the transportation without having to carry around a backpack.

I strongly recommend this one.",B00029R7Y6
"Everything is really nice and works well.
The only thing lacking is a shorter strap or a handle to eliminate the strap.",B00029R7Y6
"You can't fit much in there. I could fit my wallet, a game boy, and a digital camera in there with very very little space for anything else. But if that's all the space you need it is great! Its very well organized, which I really appreciate in a bag. I couldn't fit my phone in that front pocket so I used it as other storage space, but the pen holder fits moderator larger pens just fine.",B00029R7Y6
This is built well. Solid soft canvas material and stitching seems on par. I was expecting something a bit larger for some reason but the dimensions don't lie. It's small. Use the pen in the picture for a size comaprison. That cellphone in the pocket is very tiny.,B00029R7Y6
"Great gift for my father and useful!! My dad is always carrying money, his cellphone, personal information, his other cellphone, and now he has all of that in one single bag. Great !",B00029R7Y6
"Bag is great. Washable, large enought for work stuff and nice quality of product. Only con is the closure is unconvenient.",B00029R7Y6
"I like the look but the functionality is exactlywhat I was looking for.  When I am on the road it holds my handgun perfectly in the back compartment (compact 9mm), cell phone, a pack of smokes in the second compartment, ink pen and sunglasses perfectly.  If I get out on foot I throw it over my shoulder or wear it on my belt.  Zippers work great and I am sure the canvas will look better and better with age.  Well made.",B00029R7Y6
"I had one for a long trip to Israel.  Held my small camera, sunglasses, a few shekels, energy pills, and a bunch of small misc.  Darn if I didn't give it away 6 months after we returned home.  Tried other over the shoulder small bags but I missed this one for it's rugged look, perfect size and comfortable carrying.  Being made of canvas you can won't mind tossing it around or getting it dirty.  And, it is manly!  Send me another!",B00029R7Y6
"In addition to being small, it is made of a thick material. So the capacity is quite limited, just enough for a pair of sun glasses, wallet, cell phone and a small camera. However, it is, as someone has already mentioned, very masculine.
All other bags are unisex at best.",B00029R7Y6
"As a guy I needed a small handbag, but obv. a ladies purse was not going to cut it. This hits the spot! I highly recommend!",B00029R7Y6
"nice bag of decent quality for everyday use for a great price. minimalistic but in a good way. comfortable to carry and looks manly. can't go wrong for the price if you need a small bag that isn't fancy. this isn't a tumi or victronox but who cares about logos anyway?  i can easily fit what i need -- iPhone, wallet, keys, sun glasses + small sundries with extra room for small snack and even a water bottle if I'm out on an excursion.",B00029R7Y6
Terrific wallet. I don't have enough words to provide the degree to which I like and enjoy all of the products that Rothco makes and sells.,B00029R7Y6
"This minisatchel is extremely well made, durable and easy to use. The olive drab color and the canvas-like cloth makes the bag look like it is used for carrying ammunition. In short, it's a bag you can carry without attracting whistles from construction workers.",B00029R7Y6
"The only thing I would like different would for it to be more lightweight.. a bit heavier than what I would like. The cell phone holder pocket is too small for my Note2  which is a large phone but the phone fits inside the bag itself with room to spare. The other inside pocket holds my small wallet. The cell phone pocket seems really small to me but I guess would do for an older smaller phone.
It is very sturdy and looks like it should last for a long time.",B00029R7Y6
"Not too small, not too large. Just right for.taking around your small things, like cell phone, wallet, keys, passport, etc, without having to stuff your pockets. Tough material,  black,  good shoulder strap, very reasonable price. Five stars. HB",B00029R7Y6
"I have a bag that I carry with me to work every day, that I keep all my personal belongings in. It is a little on the large side though. So I decided to pick up one of these bags as a way to down size. This is a very nice bag indeed, but unfortunately it is too small for what I carry. I tried even downsizing to just the basics of what I need, but still wouldn't quite work the way I had hoped.i will instead use it for  a first aid kit to keep in the car.",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this bag for my husband to take on a trip overseas at the end of the year.  We haven't gone yet, but I can see it will be perfect for the him, most of all, it is manly.  He was happy to see it isn't feminine and he really likes it, said it is just the right size and has nice compartments and pockets where he can carry a cell phone, a pen, a camera and his medications and it has belt loops so he can wear it on his belt at his waist or can use the strap to wear over his shoulder.

We are very pleased with this bag.  Thanks!",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this to conceal carry my firearm (G26) and also 3 spare magazines. Looks great and well made. I like the straps for shoulder option
And it's removable. Highly recommended. Durable material.",B00029R7Y6
"It's fun to watch her try to stuff everything in one of her big purses into this pint sized bag. She's had to narrow down her choices of what to carry since the bag is small, but it's still overflowing! Good bag, good value.",B00029R7Y6
"Bag is very well-made, pockets just the right size.  Especially convenient for carrying all my diabetic supplies including CGM.iPhone fits into front pocket.",B00029R7Y6
This bag had room but wasn't tall enough for my glasses case. I liked all the pockets and different sections though.,B00029R7Y6
"This is my second bag purchase of a military style bag from RothCo and this one is as well made and thought out as the other.

The pocket on the front holds my iPhone 5 in a OtterBox with room to spare.

The interior has two main pockets and the back main compartment has a interior pocket as well.  There is also a small pocket on the front with a zipper, parallel to the pen sheath that you can not see on any of the pictures online.

I can fit my wallet, a pocket sized notebook, a iPhone charger and plug, my car key and a house key inside and still have room.

Both of my bags from RothCo are black, and if color is your deal - they are super black. I think the fabric that they wove to make the canvas was dyed black before it the canvas was woven (as opposed to dyed black after it was woven) so it should resist fading for a long time.

My only complaint is that the strap is a little thin, as in width wise, but as I mentioned in my review of my first bag this was made for guys in the field running around doing Army stuff, not a a chubby white dude in a cubical so i'll let it slide.",B00029R7Y6
A perfect size to keep my small items neat and handy. I use it for a camera bag and place to keep the phone.,B00029R7Y6
"We also have the Rothco Venturer Travel Portfolio Bag which will hold a Ipad Mini inside an Otterbox. This is smaller although  perfectly suited for holding some work paraphnelia( camera, handheld gauges, pens, pencil, scissors) without wearing a fanny pack. Both items a well constructed and we are pleased with the purchases.",B00029R7Y6
Yep...it is what it's supposed to be.  Compact and efficient design.  Useful to carry all of the necessary do-dads for travel.,B00029R7Y6
"I bought this for my Boyfriend because he was always sticking his stuff in my bag to hold, then he would forget where they where. He puts his phone, wallet, sunglasses, coupons, reusable grocery bags and pens and note pad (for all his nerdy ideas). He likes that it looks like a bag and not a purse.",B00029R7Y6
"It's a bit small, I couldn't fit what I needed into it. For odds and ends, it's ok.  You get what you pay for.",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this bag for my godson and it fits all the items he normally stuffs in his pockets - cell phone, wallet, pens and now he added a little book of quotes.  It might be small for some but it's just the right size for him.",B00029R7Y6
"I got this bag for my husband who goes to aikido classes. He likes to wear his uniform and this bag is small enough for him to take everything he needs to the class. The bag holds a wallet, a bunch of keys and a cell with a little extra room for maybe glassess. Overall my husband is very pleased with this bag.",B00029R7Y6
My father is a diabetic and he tends to lose his wallet a lot.  This bag keeps his diabetic stuff and wallet and he said he likes the fact it's simple and not bulky.,B00029R7Y6
"I purchased the organizer for my husband.  He uses it to carry his glasses, phone and a few small personal items.  It serves its purpose but it is smaller than he would have liked.  The workmanship is poorer than expected.",B00029R7Y6
"It is perfect to carry my glock 26 in a pocket holster. I use it in the summer to carry my handgun, extra magazines and sunblock with a high intensity flash light. It needs a shoulder pad but they're relatively easy to obtain.",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this for my wife as an every day bag and she really liked it. It is tough and does the job. Its not fancy, and it may not be pretty, but it works.",B00029R7Y6
"I thought it would be a bit larger, but I can make due with it. They mentioned it would be small.",B00029R7Y6
"Nice , small bag. It came prett quick, I like it and it is as good as the description showed.",B00029R7Y6
"I would recommend this organizer for any guy that is on the go. It has plenty of space for all your devices and over stuffed wallet. It also has a very long strap so it has no problem adjusting to hang just below the belt. It also, conveniently has belt loops, though I doubt I will use them.",B00029R7Y6
"Girls don't run away from this one either. Although I bought this one for the hubby, I would buy this for me. He uses it everyday and I don't have to carry his stuff any more.

Made very well. :)",B00029R7Y6
"I bought this for my husband who is a dogwalker. This holds everything he needs while dog-walking - phone, keys, extra ""poop"" bags and there's even room to tuck a small scooper in the 2 straps on the back of the bag.  And his hands are free to control the leashes & do everything else his furry charges need him to do!",B00029R7Y6
"This product is sort of like a CD case that is big enough to hold some basic items.  I keep a pen, small moleskine notebook, cell phone, keys, pocket knife, and some other basic tools... holds it all

Pros
* Quality product
* Plenty of pockets (2 main compartments, 1 small)
* Stiching good
* Exactly as advertised

Cons
* Not YYK zippers
* cell phone holder too small for my Samsung Galaxy Note ( Very large phone - 6"" tall) should work for normal phones

The reason I gave this 4 stars to this was I did not expect it to hold my cell phone, but is a nice way to keep organized.",B00029R7Y6
"I purchased this bag in black; It looks very nice. The cellphone pocket is used for business cards and glasses. One pocket carries my wallet and keys and the other pocket carries my Ipod and associated cords. There is a side pocket that carries my small cell phone. I wanted a bag that could carry my day to day stuff but not be two big.  The bag is well constructed, with no flaws.",B00029R7Y6
"The fact that the cell phone in the picture is probably from the 80's? and too large for the pocket as well, made me a little leery about buying this bag.  But I'm glad I did.

If you're looking for a bag to organize small items, look elsewhere. There are a few small compartments but most of the bag consists of two ""large"" compartments, plus the one to hold a cell phone (or a brick).  The strap is long enough to adjust it to wear cross shoulder style, for a more ""manly"" look.  Other than the zippers getting caught on occasion, it works well for what I needed.",B00029R7Y6
I did not think the bag was this small.  should read description of item next time.  I had to purchase another bag for my trip.,B00029R7Y6
"We had purchased this bag when we were planning our trip for Europe for my son so he could carry things we needed, you something manly so he would not look so feminine...you know how that goes. He loves the bag and still plans to use it for other things.",B00029R7Y6
"This bag is perfect for me:
--the outside pocket with the flap fits my iPhone nicely (it would also fit a much thicker phone)
--I like to carry a pen with me
--the pocket on the front with the vertical zipper fits my wallet
--having two large pockets is nice so I can put stuff I need more often in one
--the little inside pocket is great for storing small things so they don't get lost or fragile things so they don't get scratched by my other stuff

It's pretty small, and I sometimes want to carry more stuff or larger stuff, but that's good -- I have to choose carefully what to bring, which means I don't end up toting around a bunch of stuff I never use.

Someone gave me this identical bag in green, but I bought a new one because the clips on the shoulder strap broke, the green was really faded, and I wanted black. I don't know whether the clips were weak or whether the person had it for a really long time and abused it. And I don't know whether the green fades easily or whether it was really old. I know it was at least 10 years old and the previous owner hadn't used it recently and she kept it in a closet that is brightly sunlit for a few hours every day.

If the clips on this one break, I'll find a way to fix them or just buy a new one -- I've never found another bag that comes close to having exactly what I need and nothing more.",B00029R7Y6
"I was looking for a small travel bag that I could use for my tobacco pipe when out and about, this was a great choice! As a note, I have the older bag (second product image) not the newer one with the front that opens.

DESIGN/QUALITY
This is VERY well made, using only the best quality materials. In over 2 years of use, the velcro is still very strong, the seams have not come loose and the strap is still...well...strapping.

UTILITY
This pouch is surprisingly useful, not just for my original intent but also for camping, hiking, computer repair and a million other things. I love throwing it in my carry-on with all of my important documents in to keep them all in one place!

WHY 4 STARS??
- Good for the price (+)
- Very good quality - no wear after two years!!! (+)
- Extremely utilitarian! (+)
- The older design (which I have) does not have all of the pockets of the newer one (-)

OVERALL
This is definitely a helpful bag, and the olive drab color means it's very masculine. The longevity of this product has really impressed me, especially considering the low price I paid. Recommended.

Feedback welcomed - if you didn't find this review helpful I would love to know why so I can continue to grow as a reviewer!",B00029R7Y6
"a nice solid bag, Small so make sure you read the dimensions before you buy it ( i ignored them  my bad ) but its solid and durable and nifty looking",B00029R7Y6
"Bought this for added EDC use. The size was ok for it use, I quickly found it small for the amount of stuff I needed to carry plus the added weight when I filled it with a small first aid kit, notebook, swiss army knife and a couple other stuff put a little too much weight on the side of my pant belt. It comes with a strap to be worn as a shoulder bag but that defeats the use I have for it. All these things are not negative to the bag.

However, it does have short comings. The velcro used for the cell phone pocket is nearly worthless, fuzzy and does not secure well, the cell phone pocket is also rather baggy and its design is not the best. The overall material for the bag seems rather cheap but expected for such a cheap bag. It could have benefited with dual zippers for the pockets. The material of the bag is rather thick and you find that it can limit the useful space in the bag, it also impacts parts like the pen pocket which is rather tight and you have to work at it to loosen enough for a typical ball point pen to easily go in and out of it.

So while not a terrible bag, there is room for plenty of improvement.",B00029R7Y6
"BUYERS BEWARE... this product is made with the cheapest materials possible.

I really like the looks of this bag, and I love how it has a lot of little pockets, but the hardware is the lowest end garbage you can buy.  The metal clips on the shoulder-straps broke on THE FIRST DAY I WORE IT!!",B00029R7Y6
"I really wanted to like this little canvas bag but it has too many shortcomings.  The pockets in the portfolio are too deep for regular credit cards - they slide way down and it is very difficult to remove them.  I just leave the cards I use most often standing up so I can reach them, which isn't really secure.  The velcro that holds this portfolio part shut is very loose - it opens all the time from the weight of my normal cell phone.  The clasp that holds the top of the bag shut was so hard to open and close that I just cut it off.  Since I can't close the top, my cell phone tends to slide out of the bag.  I was living with all of these minor issues, but now the lining of the pockets has started to fray - and it's a pocket that I almost never use.  It's one thing that I'm not happy with some design issues but the fact that I've had it for less than six months and it is wearing out lead me to rate it one star.  It's a great size, has a nice strap and with a few changes could be a wonderful little bag.  Without those changes, I advise you to keep looking.",B00029R7Y6
"For the price this bag is great.  It's big enough to carry everything I need for myself and my dog when we go to the park, or store.  The Velcro on the front is lacking and you might want to sew on a small buckle if you carry a high price PDA.  It's a small enough, big enough ""Every Day Carry"" bag.  The bag is about 7 inches tall and 6 inches wide.  I got the black cause I wear a lot of black, so most people don't even notice I have it on.  Well, except this one day I forgot to wear clothes, and everyone made a nice comment about the bag.",B00029R7Y6
"This bag seemed perfect for me - small, black, plenty of compartments - but the hardware just sucks. The very first time I opened it the zipper pull came off. Over the next three months little things kept on breaking one piece at a time. It's now in two pieces; a bag and a strap with no way to connect to each other.",B00029R7Y6
"This little thing is perfect for a guy, or girl for that matter, who needs to carry around a little extra stuff but doesn't want a backpack or monster tote bag.  To answer the questions about the dimensions, it's about 9-10 inches wide and tall, about 4"" thick empty.  It has two good sized main pouches, each with a good, strong zipper, two hideaway zippered pockets, as well as the pouches seen on the outside in the photo.  The larger one holds a cell phone nicely, could also hold an mp3 player, and the smaller one is great for a pen, or, for asthmatics or people with allergies, one of those pen-shaped inhalers they carry.

It has a shoulder strap which adjusts easily; I am six feet tall and it is just long enough for me, really tall folks probably wouldn't find it adequate.  It also has two loops for running your belt through to wear it holster-style.

Not much else to say: nothing fancy here, just a well-designed and tough little bag homely enough for guys to carry around without feeling weird.  If you need a product like this you can't go wrong with this one.",B00029R7Y6
"Very sturdy, holds all my stuff-wallet, cell phone, remote hearing aid control,camera,keys,comb, Handkerchief, and check book. It's a man's purse, but looks like a camera bag.",B00029R7Y6
The bag came with a broken zipper. I use it mainly to carry my cell phone and a small wallet. I'm disappointed with this product.,B00029R7Y6
"I am  a 61 one year old sales executive and I have carried a satchel similar to this one for 10  years. It started when I was having lower back issues. My chiropractor asked me to look at my wallet, which I carried in my back pocket. I was driving 37 miles to work each day and doctor told me that was the issue. Too much stuff in my wallet.  But When I took it out and put it in the seat or glove box, I was frequently forgetting to pick it up. Also what does a man do with 14 of those stupid reward tags and a wad  of office, garage, 2 cars and shed keys.  Then there are thumb drives and ink pens, etc. It was just too much to stick in pockets and ruin pants and shirts. I found this bag two years ago to replace another that finally fell apart. I carry it ever day and it  is holding up fantastic. Even the front velcro is still sticking. I just bought 3 to put back. I joke its my MURSE - man purse, but at my age could care less what people think. The size makes it non-obtrusive and its a macho kinda canvas. If you are man enough, carry one.. it will make your life more organized and you will wonder how you ever got along with out it. OH. I think the back pocket may be just big enough to carry a small handgun with a conceal  carry permit. I even carry a small muti-tool in mine and a sharp pocket knife and have been a ""hero"" a few times fixing things around the office or out in public. It just takes an adjustment to keep up with it, but after a while you don't feel right without slinging it across your body with the adjustable strap and snuggling under your arm.  just throw it in the passenger floorboard and wrap the strap around the center shifter. Its pretty rugged.!! All the zippers still working. Has a hidden inside pocket too.",B00029R7Y6

"I wanted a poncho with good coverage,wouldn't rip, and would look nice when I had to go somewhere.  This definitely fits the bill!  It arrived within the time stated.  Very pleased!",B00029R7PK
"Given the price, I guess I expected something a little more sturdy, or rugged.  It's a lot thinner and lightweight than I expected.  In fact, it's not too hard to see through it with a little effort.  Will it keep you dry?  Yes! I had a slight problem getting my head through the top (and I know my head's not that big).  But that's a good thing; you want it snug around the neck so water doesn't pour inside.  I'm curious how long it'll last.  It is huge though, and it should fit almost anyone and cover everywhere unless you're very tall or very obese.  Personally I think it worth $10-15 at most.",B00029R7PK
"As a stand alone poncho, this would be mostly fine. The rip-stop material is of good quality, it is light, and it is easily compacted for taking up minimal storage space. That being said, I have some major issues. First, this poncho does not work well with the standard Rothco poncho liner. First of all, they do not really match in terms of sizing. Also, the strings from the poncho liner, other than at the corners, do not match up well with the snapping system of the poncho. This poncho does not have eyelets in the middle, like the standard military issue ones do, and while some of the eyelets have holes going all the way through, they don't seem to line up at all the way they should if you wanted a snug system. As a poncho, it's fine. If you want to create the poncho/liner sleeping bag, it's even worse. This poncho does not have dual-use snaps. As a result, when you lay it out an put the liner on top (tied at the corners), you cannot roll the unit and stop it into a sleeping bag shape. This is because the snaps only work one way, and the way they are set up on the poncho won't allow the two long sides to snap together. As a result, I purchased a Mil-Tec poncho to work with the Rothco woobie, and that product works great, has the right snaps, is of higher quality and durability, etc... all for the same price. Spend your money on that instead.",B00029R7PK
"Bought this poncho in 2010, so any new versions (if applicable) aren't relevant.

That said, I purchased this poncho to replace a military-grade poncho I had previously owned (that worked quite well). This poncho got the job done, but the material was quite thin and nowhere near the grade of the military-grade one. Sufficient for keeping rain off your body, but if you're hoping for any sort of wind protection - you're going to need to reinforce it with something else as it is (once again) quite thin.",B00029R7PK
The picture does not match the actual product camo pattern. Waste of money,B00029R7PK

"I got this for camping, and in case of the unexpected rain storm while I'm out and about. Rip-stop nylon ROCKS--they make lightweight tents out of it--and this pattern will be visible, something you want if you're anywhere around cars in the rain. I've found through experience that those ""emergency ponchos"" are basically one-shot deals--they get wet, then they get dirty, and it's pretty much all over. This would also work well as an emergency tarp or ground over.",B00029R7PK

I really don't have the funds to lose on this purchase",B00029R7PK
complete waste of money. water seeps in trough the material!! worthless!!,B00029R7PK

It's not military grade. Hood its small. Hope will really keeps me dry.,B00029R7PK
"This item is nowhere near the quality I expected for the price I paid. It's quality is poor. I have 20 years military experience and this poncho will not keep you dry more than 3-5 hours. It is thin enough that light practically shines right through it. Military ponchos are thicker and will keep you dry more than 24 hrs. It is not worth the 27.+ dollars I paid for it, and a real military poncho costs half the price. Your better off buying a 4mil (30-50 Gal.) garbage bag and cutting holes in it to stay dry.",B00029R7PK
"Works great, head hole is a little bit tight.",B00029R7PK

"As adverized, well made and what I ordered.",B00029R7PK
"Product arrived on time however, this is not anywhere near military grade. They advertise it as ""Real G.I. Style"" but I guess it depends on a persons definition of ""style."" My head could barely fit through the hole, as if this was made for a child. The material is very thin with strings coming apart at the seams. It ""is"" a poncho, just not a very good one. It's usable when there is a little sprinkle of rain outside but beyond that, I wouldn't use this thing. If this was a $7 poncho, I would give it a 3 out of 5. But this being nearly 30 bucks, this was a total ripoff.",B00029R7PK
"I have not put this to any real test, but it seems like a fine, sturdy poncho.  Much better than 90 percent of what is out there.  Just what I wanted, so I am happy with the purchase.",B00029R7PK
use it as a bike cover. could also be used as a tent. mediocre as a poncho.  should not feel like you are wearing a tent.,B00029R7PK
When you advertise this maybe try letting the buyer know this is NOT an Army issued poncho. I bought this to complete gear that was missing. But it's obviously not intial issue.,B00029R7PK
"keep the rain off real well, tight around the head hole, nothing a cut cant fix",B00029R7PK
"If you thought or think this is a Mil Spec poncho, you're going to be disappointed.  The fasteners are just buttons, not double sided snaps like a military poncho is.  This cant be used as a bivy or sleeping bag cover.  The hood and face hole are small.
I've not had it in the rain yet but have a feeling this will need some more water proofing done to it to make it function the way I want it to.  No waste draw string either.  The stitching doesn't look to be too robust and the seams don't look to be very strong.

I have several military ponchos and this one isn't close to being one.
I like to use my poncho for a variety of things and this one is probably only suitable for light rain and an emergency shelter.  No using it for a sleeping bag cover, hammock chair or other such use.

The corner eyelets look to be MUCH more flimsy than a Mil Spec poncho and I doubt will hold up to much pressure or high wind if you use this as a rain cover/shelter.
To be fare the description does just say ""style"".  I guess that's up for debate.

Plus sides - it packs very small.  I can get it pact to the size of a soda can.

It'll be a back up to my back up now.",B00029R7PK
"This seems to made well, I hope it will last, it's a little short from what I remember in the military but it will do the job.",B00029R7PK
"I bought a poncho to provide rain protection for me and belt equipment/fanny pack that I wear when hiking. I waited to use this poncho in an actual rainy situation before writing this review and I'm glad I did.  My thoughts:

Pros:
* The poncho is well constructed; seams are straight, stitching is good.
* It is very compact and will fit in a small stuff sack.

Major Con - This item is not waterproof or even very water resistant!  I wore it through a cloud burst that dumped about 1 inch of rain in a few minutes. Boy, was I disappointed!  I wore it over a T-shirt and a pair of shorts, and initially water beaded up satisfyingly on the garment.  However, any part of the poncho that was in direct contact with skin immediately bled through and became waterlogged.  The rest of the garment that touched clothes lasted a few minutes longer, but also quickly became saturated, leaving me a sodden mess after a few minutes. By the time the storm ended I had received no benefit from wearing the poncho; I might as well have just endured the rain without it.

It's a shame that something this well constructed failed so miserably, especially for a garment that serves no other purpose than to keep you dry.  My only hope, short of throwing it out, is to try something like NikWax to boost its water resistance.

If you're considering a poncho, check out a Frogg Toggs poncho. I have several Frogg Toggs products and have been generally happy with all of them.  The poncho is slightly less durable than this one, but just about 100% waterproof and breathes well, to boot!",B00029R7PK
Just what I ordered. looks good and will do the job.,B00029R7PK
We had no problems with this product.,B00029R7PK
Too small and not a real poncho..,B00029R7PK
"The pattern is a knockoff. It looks like winter camo. It is hardly even close. If you lost your poncho and are trying to replace it, go to your supply and deal with them, because this s*** looks ridiculous.",B00029R7PK
"color seemed off, for digital cammo patern!",B00029R7PK
"Very pleased!  Very sturdy, not something I have to worry about ripping the first time and being a one-time-use item.  The hood might be small for larger heads.  It fits me nicely but my head is on the smaller size.  I ordered a second one for my daughter once I saw it.

UPDATE:  First review was on sight only and was impressed by the look and feel of the ripstop material. I did not put it to use until yesterday  in light rain while hiking and........I returned home wet.  SADLY disappointed.  Gave it one star for looks and it does appear to be durable.",B00029R7PK
Just a bit too small to use while wairing a backpack,B00029R7PK
"I have the GI real thing, which I've not been able to find to have one for my wife. It was tough to pull the trigger on $25 for a poncho that's worth about half that, but I did anyway. The reason I'm not sending it back is because packed, it's half the bulk of the real one, which I'll carry for shelter. But for my tiny wife with her smaller day pack, the lack of bulk is a blessing. It's certainly not silnylon, but is less than half the price and has the needed grommets.  Just for reference, I wear a 7-3/4 hat and this barely fits over my head if I take my glasses off. The hood IS small as others have said. Ironically, that's better for my wife.",B00029R7PK
"total garbage. if this is what the military is issuing today it is the worst junk since Valley Forge. this is nothing more than a light weight civilian poncho with snaps and tie downs added with military colors. don't waste your money.

"Awesome edition to my moto backpacking gear. I've ran it as a lean to tent setup, packs down nice and small",B00029R7PK
"Got more than just a few miles in a GI poncho.  They work as expected, just don't plan on dry shins if you do not have weather proof trousers or leggings do go with it.  Still in a ""hunker down and don't drown"" situation it's just the thing.  No comparison to the cheap ponchos in ""camp stores"" these are the real deal and no ""Bug Out"""" Bag or ""Get Home"" Bag is complete without one.",B00029R7PK
"Looks good, rolls up nice and small",B00029R7PK
"As a former US Marine infantryman... I'm very use to these. Although this is very well made, it does not line up correctly with the GI Poncho liner (Any grunt knows how important this is).  Good product, just don't expect to be able to use correctly with the liner.",B00029R7PK
A poncho is a poncho. Keep this one in my jeep in case of summer storms.  Works as a tarp.,B00029R7PK
The black color great for dark/night conditions in terms of concealment.,B00029R7PK
"I mistook this for another excellent poncho that ships from Ireland, and ordered it by mistake--I should have been tipped off by the price, which is half that of the quality item.

True to many Chinese manufacturers who haven't yet been convinced of the value of building a reputation for quality products, this poncho merely mimics the dependable original while failing to replicate the quality.  The stitching is loose and seems intended to conserve on cheap thread, the hood is sized for children and miniature adults, it lacks any pretense at seam sealing to keep rain from leaking in, and the waterproofing is somehow both minimal and simultaneously stiff and noisy...  In short, just another shoddy ""monkey see, monkey do"" Chinese ripoff product...

I remember when ""Made in Japan"" was a pejorative that they overcame, and continue to expect that someday the same will be true of Chinese products, but that ain't happening yet, and this poncho is just further proof of that...",B00029R7PK
"Great gear, and works fine for what I wanted it for - extra ponchos for my son (aged 8 at the time), and my wife.",B00029R7PK
"Not military grade as advertised, poor reproduction and very, very undersized.  Would not recommend.",B00029R7PK
"I was disappointed that it was not the real issueGI pancho, how ever, I did find it very
Sturdy and useful.  I just finished camping during my time the weather
Changed and it rained and the temp dropped into the upper 40's.. I found
It useful to keep warm and dry...now if they would only add 2 more grommets

Wobbie would fit.....",B00029R7PK
"Covers what needs covered during a rain storm. can be tied down to fit tight, but does leave some areas bare.",B00029R7PK
Very nice ...  and it serves our intended use very well ... which is to also cover a bike when caught in the rain,B00029R7PK
The hood opening is too small and doesn't comfortably fit when putting on. Other than that it makes a decent tarp,B00029R7PK

"A friend of mine had a Vietnam usgi poncho so I got this one bcuz his was stylin'.  Same size and all but mine seems to be thinner.  The old heavy duty ones are getting hard to find and quite pricy.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it's compactability, quality, usefulness, and newness.  Throw one of these in your kit with a woobie and earthtone hammock.  Laplander and emberlite stove also a must.",B00029R7PK
"It is a new camo ripstop poncho with hood.  But the hood wouldn't fit a helmet, and the drawstring isn't the same as issued.  Only 4 gromets on the corners, none halfway on edges.  No heavy duty waterproof material on underside and no torso drawstrings.  Camo is a little dark to be true woodland.  It would work if you just wanted a poncho.  Not military issued/surplus/milspec/etc.",B00029R7PK
"This poncho is absolutely not what I expected. It is a Rothco product (which I assumed would be well made) and is made in China. The material and workmanship does not impress me at all. So, I'll be sending it back. I just ordered the poncho listed by ""Old Grouch's Military Surplus"", which I did not find until I had already ordered this one. It is a military contractor made poncho and seems to be a more sturdy item that will more appropriately fulfill its role as a poncho and shelter, as well as a waterproof blanket and sleeping bag (with the separate poncho liner). If your just looking for a poncho that's a step above the ones that you can find at Walmart, buy this one. If you want one that's military grade, look for something else.",B00029R7PK
"I bought this with the expectation it was military grade. The color is right, but the material is not. It is very thin. One of the grommets broke when I tied it to try to make it like a canopy. It flew around a lot when I wore it on a hike because it was so thin. I was thinking of trying to find a way to add something to weigh it down. I have been issued ponchos in the army and the quality of this isn't close. I gave it 3 stars because it is waterproof and I could still use it to wrap things up to keep it dry.",B00029R7PK
This thing's pretty much like my issue poncho. Only difference was the neck hole and hood were a bit tighter than my issue poncho. Still fits well enough and since I use this one to wrap my ruck or assault bag in wet weather I really don't care. Minus one star for not matching the CIF issue gear.,B00029R7PK
"ok it is rip stop desert camp pattern.  the hood area is a little small so it isn't just like issued, but if your utilizing it for an over head or make shift cover it'll work great for keeping out the rain. honestly its great cause you could use a few to cover a hammock to stay dry and off the ground in a wet weather climate.",B00029R7PK

"I bought this to replace a ""disposable type"" rain poncho I've had for a number of months. You know the type, basically a plastic bag with arm holes and a hood. I am very pleased with this newer one I bought. I will warn you though, the head hole, and hood is a bit tight. After that, I'm very happy with it, grommets are strong enough for a quick shelter, and the snaps work just fine. Would recommend, if you don't mind the minor head hole inconvenience.",B00029R7PK
"I have already used this type of poncho, but I couldn't
get one in that time - I use it especially in freetime in the
woods, and this is very durable, so no branches will rip
it! So I can say only good about it.",B00029R7PK
"Let me begin by stating I am an avid backpacker and love ponchos.  The ability to stay hands free while working outside is very important.  I have owned this product for 6 months and have used it in several storms.  The hood is too tight and the entire upper portion leaks.  At the seams.  The materials is lightweight.  Im not sure if it is letting water permeate through or if the seams are at fault but it is worthless for my needs.  If you only going to use it from the car to the store or back again, it will work well enough but anything longer than 3 minutes will show water on your clothing.  The material is lightweight and has grommets so I may still find a use for it even if it is not 100%.",B00029R7PK
"Really a cheaply made poncho.  Paper thin, narrow head opening, very poor quality material and craftsmanship.  Won't even consider anything else made by them.",B00029R7PK
this is good it will last. great for making tent or wearing. I love them. for any on looking for tent and rain gear in on this is it,B00029R7PK
"This is the second one of these that I have purchased. The other one has served me well for several years and when a friend saw mine he asked if I would purchase one for him. I use this poncho mostly for hiking and backpacking, it is quite large enough to cover you and your backpack while hiking.",B00029R7PK
Good for hunting!  It works well with liner and is just what I needed. Would recommend to all hunters for the field.,B00029R7PK
pretty good poncho. sheds rain well and is made good. it can be used as a emergency shelter is needed.,B00029R7PK
"The poncho is better than the box-mart versions, but I had hoped for a little better quality for the price.  Bottom line:  Not bad, but not as good as I had hoped.",B00029R7PK
"I bought this item for my BOB bag, very nice will come in handy if I have to use it.",B00029R7PK
"I bought this poncho because I really hate getting wet and I get wet all of the time when camping or on manuvers...sooooo, I got the poncho to help out. Haven't used it yet but I know I will and it looks like it will do exactly what it was designed to do...keep me dry....somewhat! The camo pattern isn't exactly what I was looking for but it will do, and the hood was a good idea.",B00029R7PK
"I served 20 years in the United States Marine Corps before I retired and I can say that I was never issued a poncho that was as good as this one.  Now, I have read that some had problems getting the hood on.  I have a medium size head or at least I wear a medium size cover (hat), and I had no problems putting this thing on.  I could see someone with a larger head having some trouble.  Over all, I am very pleased with this product and I will be purchasing more of them in the future because it is a good quality poncho.  This is not a tarp; however, I would have no problems using it as one.  I would be very confident that it will work very well in that function.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!

Since I have purchased this item, I have now ordered a second one for a family member.  This is still a great product, and I am sure I will be purchasing more of them.",B00029R7PK
No up to mil spec. Gromits in the corners will probably rip out if used to make a shelter. But works OK as a poncho,B00029R7PK
"This poncho performs as expected, it good quality while being very light.  Buddy of mine in the National Guard had to borrow it for a drill weekend because he lost his issued one.. it's identical.  Grommets for tie outs, snaps, draw string, keepers, etc.. all there.",B00029R7PK
"very thin and coloring seems really bright to be camo.  I've never tested it. I keep it in my stock just in case i don't have the cheap $3 disposable green ponchos from wal-mart. I might use it some day, but no way am I carrying this for hunting purposes. it almost looks white",B00029R7PK
"I am a member of our county's Search and Rescue team that covers the Lake Tahoe area and have invested literally thousands of dollars to ensure I have the right equipment for the broad array of weather that we experience. I have few ponchos and prefer them for rainy days down to about 40 degrees .This one is easily the best of the bunch and the only one I carry in my SAR pack. Openings on the side, rather than the front keep the water out, even during driven rain, and allow for better air circulation. Draw strings for the hood offer better heat retention and prevent the hood from flapping around or blowing off your head during windy conditions. The best feature of this poncho is the material itself. It is very rugged, yet light and does have that sticky, tacky feel that is common with cheaper ponchos.

Not the cheapest on the market, but definitely the best value I've found.",B00029R7PK
this is a shoddy made poncho its priced at 5 times its value i sent mine back and it cost me 4 bucks to get it here and 4 bucks to send it back find one at a army navy store this is a waste of time and money,B00029R7PK
Looks really tough although i have not really put it to the test yet. Seams look good. Fairly Lightweight too.,B00029R7PK

was a good idea. It was a little noisy for the wood the material
swished when you moved. but otherwise a good product",B00029R7PK
"Good construction, loose sizing. Granted, branded as GI means you get camo only, I would like to see more color options. As someone in the Pac NW we get a lot of rain when camping and use these regularly - the standard wispy poncho's won't cut it. This one should stand up to several years of use.",B00029R7PK
"I bought this because my issued poncho was stolen and I needed a replacement. I knew that I couldn't use it to turn in to CIF, but I wanted a poncho, so I got this one. Ok, it kind-of blocks the rain... For an hour or so. The head opening and hood are so small I can barely fit my head thru them, let alone a hat or helmet. Used as a rainfly it does ok, so long as you leave a path for run off leaking. I gave it 2 stars because when I needed it I was glad to have it, but just barely...",B00029R7PK
"I purchased this product thinking that it was similar to the one I used in the Marine Corps but this is NOT the same.  The first time I used it in heavy rain it did not keep out the water.  I started getting wet down my neck and down my back...not sure if there was a leak in the hood (i never found one).  Anyway...it is what it is.

Update on this...It was the seams around the hood that were leaking. I used some seam sealer (stuff used for waterproofing tents and such)and it seems to be better.  Still, you would think a rain poncho would keep out the rain.",B00029R7PK
Don't let the GI in the title fool you.  This is not a Mil Spec poncho & is a cheap chinese knock off.  Would not rely on this item to keep me sheltered or dry.,B00029R7PK
"I ordered my first poncho and am ordering a second one today.

The ponco is durable and gets the job done for blocking rain, I am buying a second one so that I can set up a larger temporary shelter as needed.

It doesn't take up much space in the hiking bag and knowing it is there if I need it is great.

Would recommend to any hiker/camper.",B00029R7PK
Do you want to know why on the picture that guy did not put on the hood. It is because he cannot. The poncho body is design for an adult but the hood is for an infant.,B00029R7PK
"Have not used this as an emergency tent yet, but it seems great, has clips at the bottom to join up and has loops to tie down as an emergency shelter.",B00029R7PK
"This is nothing more than tent material. It does the job, but, is nothing like a real slicker. The material is very stiff like the floor in your tent. The hood is very small on mine. Barely fits my head and is a little uncomfortable. If you are looking to use it as a stowe away in your truck for an occasional use, it fills that purpose just fine.",B00029R7PK
"This ""GI Style"" poncho is good quality, fits my rather large frame nicely (5'10"" 220lbs), and is good looking as well. We have been getting a lot of rain here in PA over the past few weeks and the outside chores were piling up, so we got two of these ponchos (also for my son) so we could work outside without getting drenched.

The poncho is roomy, allows for free movement of our arms, and is indeed waterproof.

Recommended!

CFH",B00029R7PK
"Unfortunately, I cannot say much good about this poncho except that it looks really cool and seems durable. Others have given it good reviews; maybe I got one that slipped past quality control, but I know that at least one other customer has already said what I am about to.

The whole point of a poncho is to keep the wearer dry, right? That's what I was expecting. That the product was not advertised as ""100% waterproof"" didn't phase me. After all, who would ever sell a poncho that *isn't* waterproof?? Apparently, Rothco does.

The first time I tried the poncho was at the onset of a heavy downpour. Within minutes I could feel moisture on the inside of it, and later when I got inside and pulled it off, I was completely soaked! I was really upset, but instead of returning the product, I decided to try to waterproof it myself. I picked up some silicone spray for tents from Wal-Mart, followed the directions carefully, and didn't use the poncho for a few months. Today I finally got to try it again-- thank you tropical storm Lee. While it did stay drier for a bit longer, after I had been outside walking for about an hour, I was drenched again.

I have given up hope on this one. If you need some concealment for paintball or airsoft on a dry day, have at it. If you need something to actually keep the rain away, something that a real GI or outdoorsman would appreciate, do yourself a big favor and forget about it.",B00029R7PK
"These are well made and the digital camo allows the wearer to blend into your outdoor surroundings. Great for paintballing, observing nature and when the weather turns foul they keep you dry, if one owns the poncho liner they also keep you warm in the coldest of weather and wind proof. Rothco makes great products.",B00029R7PK
"People shopping for a poncho will likely notice a fairly large disparity of price between the throw-away style of poncho made of extremely thin material and (at most) a metal snap or two, and those that cost 20 or 30 times more, but are hand-crafted and made to last forever. I was in the segment that needed something in between. I wanted something lightweight, tightly packed, that would survive a two week hike in the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee.

This RothCo poncho worked adequately for my needs. Folded up, it took very little space. When on me, it kept me dry, and was strong enough not to rip and tear on every branch I came in contact with. It was also strong enough to have some paracord run through it to help along with another poncho and a tarp for a makeshift canopy on our campsite.

After about a week, I did begin to notice some slight fraying and ripping along stress points on the material and around the snap enclosures. This poncho is perfect for a short vacation if you don't want to spend over $50, but don't want to be throwing away a poncho after every single use.",B00029R7PK
"This poncho proved to be very good when we were surprised by high winds and a sleet shower while hiking at about 6000 ft....I could wear it over my backpack.
It's not heavy and serves the purpose.
I would recommend this product.",B00029R7PK
"I ordered this after reading the reviews thinking that this product would do what it was primarily intended to do, that being keeping you dry.

This morning we were receiving a moderate rain, so I thought it would be a good test when I went to walk my dog. I fastened the hood over my head, and started out on a mile and half walk.  About a third of the way, (10 minutes) I could start to feel moisture inside the poncho.  By the time I got back home, my head and shoulders were soaked and the rest of my upper body quite damp.

Save your money, find something else.",B00029R7PK
Not as expected and is not the same as a real issued GI poncho. This picture looks different then what I got.,B00029R7PK
"I recently took up hunting again (wild pigs in Texas), and while I've been a serious backpacker since 1971, I never owned a poncho; never saw the need.  But now, I find that using one shields me and my rifle from the rain and wind and, at the same time, provides excellent camouflage.  I've used the tie-out points to lash it to trees as a quick shelter in 30mph winds - with no tears.  I'm now buying it as a gift for friends who also hunt.",B00029R7PK
Save your money and get a real poncho. This is not the same style or quality as an original. very misleading. i wouldnt buy another one for $2!,B00029R7PK
"Well, its waterproof, its camo and it didn't rip. Isnt that the point? Ive had it for about two weeks and have used it at work with the snow, freezing rain (wouldnt recommend that to anybody), and sleet. It does work. I got camo so I could use it as a rainfly on my army style tent as well, using it as work just came as a perk. If you do use this in freezing rain, let it thaw on its own. If you mess with it while its still frozen, it will fight you and then you can chance tearing it.",B00029R7PK
"On a positive note, this poncho is much lighter than the military issued model. I have not field tested this poncho, but I have serious doubts about the quality. Mine was missing one grommet. The color and pattern are okay, but somewhat lighter than the picture. This poncho may not be ready for serious use, but it's probably okay to stick one in your bug out bag for emergency rain wear or shelter.",B00029R7PK
I hiked all over Alberta Canada and used the poncho a lot. My only complaint is the hole for your head is too small. I wear glasses and it was really hard to get it over my head. Other than that it's great.,B00029R7PK
I wanted to wait to review this till I had field tested it. It finally got use two days ago as I spent around 4 hour in the rain. Worked like a charm. My only complaint is its country of origin (Chi-Com). I would highly recommend this product.,B00029R7PK
I thought this product would be cheaply made of light weight plastic material boy was I wrong. This Poncho is made of thick material that has the rip stop stitching. The poncho even has four grommets so that the poncho can be made into a quick shelter. I am placing this one into my go-bag and I may order another.,B00029R7PK
Just what I was looking for and it was good quality.  Will go to the 13 year old for camping but i could use this myself easily.,B00029R7PK
"The poncho looks good, and the material is much thicker than the el-cheapo throw away kind.",B00029R7PK
"It will certainly keep you dry, but putting gromets in the corners of this poncho is kind of a bad joke...way too lightweight to string up.  The older style military ponchos were heavier duty and could take the abuse, not here.  However, if you are looking for a very lightweight poncho for backpacking use it would work out fine.  I think that the hood is too small and tight on my head...yes i have a big head, but it's still a problem.  I chose to push it back and use a boonie instead.  It's ok is about the best i could say.",B00029R7PK
"Without a doubt an essential element for those who enjoy the charms of nature.
It allows you to isolate yourself from the rain and if necessary it becomes a shelter, with  just a bit of rope you would  get an emergency tent.
It is lightweight and easy to carry, comes in a thick plastic bag which will allow a practical and convenient transport.
I love this version of camouflage as it is the most advanced.
Great product and very useful.",B00029R7PK
I love the outdoors camping and hiking. The lighter my backpack the better which is why i bought this poncho it makes for the perfect one person tent or shelter from the rain or the sun. Light as a feather and very sturdy also. Snap two together for a much roomier tent or three will also make a floor.,B00029R7PK
"This item was as advertised and on time.  There were no flaws or problems with the merchandise, and the merchant managed to get the item to me in minimal time.",B00029R7PK
"The poncho is big enough to wear over you backpack and cover every inch of you for protection against the rain and harsh weather environments. It is made of durable nylon fabric and the olive drab color just looks cool.

Everytime I wear this I feel like Rambo in First Blood and the hood is useful too.

Overall, perfect product. Exactly what I expected. Love it.",B00029R7PK
"- Pros: will keep you dry and/or warm. Resistant to punctures like from thorns in rain forests. Helps to keep bugs away. Can be used as a light blanket at night.
- Cons: a little heavy for backpacking, but still an absolutelly necessary peace of the survival kit. Can also be used as a stuff sack (to hang food in trees for example) and ground cloth.",B00029R7PK
"Ok, it is much more than I expected. Super light, and durable! For this amount? Crazy crazy. Absolutely wonderful piece of my survival gear.",B00029R7PK
"Received poncho in great shape and good time. Product is as described, ""military style"". Being an old timer I was expecting a heavier fabric but this poncho should do its duty for a while. Seems to be well made otherwise.",B00029R7PK
"I am endorsing this ripstop nylon camo pattern version of the poncho, but what I write is applicable in general to just about all heavier-duty nylon, rubber or urethane coated, military or outdoors camping-grade ponchos.  Almost every military in the world issues them.  There are many high-quality commercial brands (including the ones sold here).  But whatever the maker/origin, they are one of the most practical and useful items to have in your kit, IMHO.

I was just thinking about this as the rainy season just started here and I attached my ""rain/cold weather"" MOLLE pouch to my belt.  My belt pouch module (6"" X 6"" X 3"") contains my rain poncho, an emergency bivy sack, a Nomex hood (which rolls up like a watch cap), and a chemical hand-warmer packet.  These items added to what I already carry everyday, make me prepared for inclement weather or even an unscheduled night out in the elements.

A poncho is not much more than a large piece of water-proof cloth (or vinyl) with a headhole that allows it to be worn, completely covering the front and back of the body (including equipment and pack).  The technology dates back to the American Civil War when Union soldiers were issued ""Gum Blankets"" which were pieces of canvas coated with a rubber mixture (made by ""Goodyear"" believe it or not!).  It is very effective as raingear.  Ah!  but a poncho can be so much more.

Though not the most effective at this function, a poncho is a rudimentary (minimally insulative) blanket.  When used in combination with a quilted poncho liner, it becomes a very effective blanket.

When laid out on the ground, it's a nice waterproof ground cloth.  Basically like any tarpaulin.

When snapped into a tube, it forms a simple sleeping bag.

This same tube makes a field expedient body bag.

In Ranger School, they teach a technique by which two ponchos can be sealed together to make a pontoon float that can buoy two full rucksacks.

A poncho is very effective for smoke signalling (trapping and accumulating smoke).

When suspended or supported overhead, it makes a good shelter (or tent).  It can also protect (shelter) individual objects sensitive to moisture.

This same shelter idea can be used to collect water (rain) in a survival situation, channeling into a basin or canteen.

Similarly, it can be hung up as a wind/sun shelter or blind to conceal something.

It's wind catching ability can be capitalized on to form a sail, if lost at sea or on open water.

The technique is not easily explained (in text), but a poncho (and many sticks) can be used to make an effective ""fish trap"" in a survival situation.

Like any large piece of cloth, it can be an emergency catch blanket for someone to jump down into from a height.

Like any large piece of cloth, it can be a drag sled or litter (for dragging game, or tranporting an injured person).

Similarly, it can be used to carry large, heavy loads of anything (firewood, dirt, stones, ammo, forage).

If rolled, folded correctly, it can carry several gallons of water in one load for short distances.

Although I wouldn't trust my weight on it as a ""hammock"", I have personally used a poncho along with rope and paracord to help hold/haul loads up into a tree blind and to suspend food away from bears and critters.

With tent poles or any flexible ""poles"" of sufficient length, one can make an Alpha Tent (low dome personal bivy)out of a poncho by putting the end of the tent poles through the opposite (not adjacent) corner grommets of the poncho.

Looking at Native American ""shirts"" in museums, one can see that the poncho idea (a headhole through an animal skin) is the basis for much early clothing.  One of the great things about a poncho as clothing is that it can be easily improvised (like in Rambo: First Blood).  A rectangular piece of cloth, headhole and some rope to belt it off.  And anything waterproof, like a trash can liner, upholstery, animal skin or tarp, can become poncho for raingear.

Similar to the clothing concept, the poncho forms a basic cape, and if the poncho is camofluaged or matches the environmental colours, it makes a decent ""mobile"" sniper veil.  This variant type of poncho is actually an issue item in Eastern Bloc armies.

I know this is silly, but once, I had occasion to use my grey poncho as a field expedient slide projector screen out in the jungle.

I'm sure there are many more functions for a poncho, but I'll leave it at that for now.  Bottomline is, with all the very useful, potentially life-saving uses of this simple device, I think it's an excellent investment for anyone's ""Emergency Preparedness Kit"".  So why not add one?",B00029R7PK
I love the quality of the cloth itself.  Strong.  And the pattern of the camouflage.,B00029R7PK
Cheap Rip off brand... almost like the ACU pattern was bleached.,B00029R7PK
"A thin imitation of the real thing, this poncho Is not designed for heavy duty wind and weather but will get the job done in a moderate downpour. Being very light weight, it would make a good addition to any emergency kit.",B00029R7PK
"This is one of those purchases you order, stick in your car and forget about.....until that day when you are stuck in a downpour.  Boy am I glad this handy bit of kit was there. Its a simple rain poncho, it'll keep you dry- that's it. Its not a superhero cape, won't make you fly or leap buildings. Its made of ripstop nylon, relatively soft, little crinkly but so what?....you're dry and both of your hands are free. The guy next to you at the bus stop with his sad little wind inverted umbrella soggy briefcase is not.",B00029R7PK
"I just got this poncho, so I can't speak to its ability to keep me dry. I can say that it weights only 9.7 oz., just over a third of the weight of another full-size poncho that weighs about 28 oz. The heavier one also has three metal snaps on each side and cord ties on each corner. This poncho has only two snaps on each side and no cords in the corner grommets.

The listed size is 56"" x 90"". the actual measurements are 55"" x 88"". While not quite the stated size, it is longer than my other poncho, which is about 3-4 inches shorter than listed by its vendor. I am 6'2"" and so ponchos barley reach me knees and cover only part of my arms. However, I think this poncho will be better than most ""emergency"" ponchos made of plastic.",B00029R7PK
"Totally not waterproof and somewhat water resistant; with even moderate rain this 'poncho' lets plenty of moisture through in less than 10 minutes. I'm glad I tried it out in town before taking it hunting; that would have been a cold, wet and awful experience.

Do not buy this if you plan on spending more than a few minutes in the rain.",B00029R7PK
Head opening is small. I guess that's good for keeping water out. Need to spray water repellent frequently. Material isn't a natural water barrier. Packs up real small.,B00029R7PK
Size of the hoodie is a little too small. Probably better to just buy this in store and aviod manufacture defected materials,B00029R7PK

"The label inside the shorts says they are a Youth size!  These are for children, not teenagers or adults.  The description does not contain this information so now these have to go back.",B0002A4JZA
This fits just great. I will have to have someone help me get it on. I won't be able to on my own. But it is long enough to fit just right. Cuts on the back a little. But that may be just my own pudge.,B0002B6PHY
It's very pretty and it holds me up pretty good the way I like it to but it was a little small around the body area.  Other than that...I love it!!!,B0002B6PHY
"this was made from really awful materials. the boning was so flexible not only did it not shape anything, but it didn't keep the cups up either. it also buckled and bowed instead of forming to my curves, even if it could not tighten them. would not buy again. but the return policy for this company was nice. I'd buy from them again--just not an item like this.",B0002B6PHY
"I bought this for my wedding day, and it was perfect! Perfectly supportive  AND slimming! I am a size 18 with D cups, so those traits are not easily found together in one piece. The back dips a couple inches below where a normal bra would be. It was very comfortable, comes with clear and colored straps (I didn't use either) and colored (mine was ivory), removable, stocking attachments. Very sexy; my husband loved it, too!",B0002B6PHY

"This corset looks great and after ordering many of the Carnival brand corsets, I was worried that they were all made the same way. That wasn't the case here. Where the Carnival brand all had issues with poor cup size and overall design around the top, this one is made darn near perfect. It might be a half a size to large at the top but that isn't even noticeable.",B0002B6PHY
Fit perfect true to size made my outfit look beautiful no lines under my dress...enhanced my shapes showed my curves as I am very slim it made me look shapely and gorgeous,B0002B6PHY

"I thought this bustier was very pretty when I got it. But, even though in everything else I'm a 36DDD, it was too small and would have needed a 38DDD. The reason I returned it without exchanging was that it was too tall for my dress, and wouldn't have worked, being the right size or not. (that's just a chance you take when ordering online). Other than running small, it was well made and very pretty for being a simple bustier.",B0002B6PHY
did not fit and it said plus size so if your a 2xx get a 4xxxx,B0002B6PHY
It's a nice product but I ordered a size up and it was still too small.,B0002B6PHY
"Get a size 2x bigger, the fit is very small.",B0002B6PHY
"I bought two of these to make sure I got the right fit. I definitely recommend trying at least two of you don't exactly know your measurements. They are basically the same bra they give you at David's bridal to try on your dress, only these are way more affordable! I usually wear a 42C but ended up wearing a 44B in my dress. The fit was great, it definitely smoothed everything out, but didn't give much lift to my bust. It just held me in enough and even felt a little roomy up top. If you are satisfied with the bra you get at DB, buy one of these and save some money! Just give yourself enough time and try a couple! If you have to return, it is an easy process as well. The process was easy!",B0002B6PHY
"It was a struggle to put on. Once it was on, it felt okay. However, I do not have an assistant to help me get dressed so it is unpractical.",B0002B6PHY
can't wear if you have a belly unless your large busted. Top fit well but waist to small,B0002B6PHY
"This was no way near a 40C, and it came with no instructions or receipt so I can return it.",B0002B6PHY
This is not plus size they come in a super small size. No real lift because again it's too small. I got a larger size than my real size and even then it was small. I wouldn't save my money and skip this product,B0002B6PHY
I have read other reviews on the outfit being to small and too big but I thought I still give it a try. They were right way to big on the top and way to tight small around the waist. When u read the sizes it matched but when u get it the bra doesn't measure up,B0002B6PHY
Fits as ecpected. I ordered one size up like recommended.,B0002B6PHY
Ran a little small from the other corsets I've purchased.,B0002B6PHY
A little large on the cup size but served its purpose. I really like it and will wear it again.,B0002B6PHY
Great styling and construction. Just wish it fit me!,B0002B6PHY
"This is a great product. I'm have very large chest and this product fit perfect, which is always a big deal for me. I will for sure recommend this to my friends and family",B0002B6PHY
I purchased this for my wedding and it worked. I am a 16 very busty and it held up perfectly and was comfy.,B0002B6PHY
I went up a size in width and down a size in the cup.  The cup was still huge.,B0002B6PHY
"Cups were a little wrinkled, not completely smooth as they should have been.  Otherwise, great support and slimming.",B0002B6PHY
"wayy to small, measured myself with tape and 35 inches around still don't fit in the 38, these bridal sizes are bs",B0002B6PHY
"Just tried it on, seems tight in waist & large in bust.",B0002B6PHY
Wore this for my wedding.  Very happy,B0002B6PHY
"Way too small. I run a 38c. There was noooo way I'd even be able to come close to getting into it! It was beautiful, however. Just bummed it didn't fit.",B0002B6PHY
I got this for my wedding and it was a life saver for my dress! It was so hard to find something to wear under my strapless dress as a woman with larger breasts. This wasn't pinchy and it was supportive,B0002B6PHY
Fit is very small compared to bra size,B0002B6PHY
"I ordered many bustiers in an effort to find ""the one"" to wear under my bridal gown. I was afraid Amazon Prime would drop me as a customer from all the returns I was making (of course they wouldn't). Of the fifteen or so bustiers I tried on, this one was among the best. I've found that Va Bien is generally the highest-quality brand of all the bustiers I've tried. I ultimately decided against it in favor of a different Va Bien bustier that fit very similarly but was more lightweight--the satin was a bit heavy as a material and I'm a July bride. But I think this would be a solid choice for a winter bride who wouldn't mind the extra insulation. The fit was mostly true to size...I ordered my usual 32DD and it was a supportive and flattering fit. Not much padding, but it still seems to do a good job shaping and enhancing. I did have to put all the hooks on the tightest setting, so you could try sizing the band down a size if you want the bustier to do more shaping work.",B0002B6PHY
Measure yourself accurately and this will fit just fine!,B0002B6PHY
"It is full coverage, so it stuck out of my sweatheart wedding dress on top. Also the boning ist very thick, so it made my dress be too small. I guess that is great shaping though. It deoends on what you are looking for.",B0002B6PHY
"I ordered this only after reading reviews specifically for the size and near the size I needed.
I sized up since most of these products are not the same size.  I typically wear a 38DDD or sometimes 36G depending on fit, and ordered a 40DD to compensate.
The cup sizes almost fit and I could have worked with that; they were just a little small.  The band however wouldn't even clasp... There is no way it was actually a 40 band size; it fit more like a 34.  I would not suggest buying this if you are bigger than average.
Basically if you decide to order this and are on the larger side, order 4 band sizes up.
I will be returning this because I don't want to play games with sizing.",B0002B6PHY
Wish the fit was better but I'm still gonna use it. It's affordable in comparison to other options.,B0002B6PHY
"A better material than most similar bustiers, the back is one of the highest of those I've tried, I found it ran about a size small in band size.",B0002B6PHY
Returned. I probably would have needed to go up 3 sizes. Not worth it.,B0002B6PHY
The cups offer no support. The waistline was great.,B0002B6PHY
"Ordered 4 different bustiers to wear on my wedding and kept this one because it had the most belly tucking, waist cinching and boob compacting without being insanely uncomfortable.",B0002B6PHY
"Ran Large but, If your Large breasted, that area will fit well",B0002B6PHY
"The product itself seems to be good quality and fit as expected (make sure you go down a cup size and up at least one size in the band), but it hit me at a weird place. I thought with it being a ""longline"" that it would be lower than most corsets I've tried on, but it was the same for me (I'm 5'4 38D). I am returning because it hit my body at an unflattering location and was not as long as expected.",B0002B6PHY
"Way too small, and difficult if not impossible to put on by yourself. Wish it had front closure. Bra is just a shell, no padding, and fits funny. Sending back.",B0002B6PHY
love this bra..helps hold my muffin top in and great support.,B0002B6PHY
really does the trick.  even manages to support a large bust.,B0002B6PHY
"It's a nice product, but comes in too small. I'm 5'5"" weight 140 lbs I wear 34D on regular bra and I bought same size on corset. I couldn't even try to try it on it didn't fit... It was about 5 inch too small.",B0002B6PHY
I ordered this corset in my size and were unable to hook it at all. Seems to run small. All others ordered in the same size fit.,B0002B6PHY
"This is my second purchase of this item. It's just perfect. It fits well in the cups, gives excellent support, and the bodice is long enough that it smoothes you all the way down without creating bulges. So you can wear it under a pencil skirt or something else fitted, for example. My only (very small ) problem it that the outer sides of each cup (that have an underwire) stick out ever so slightly,and that kind of pokes into my under arm area, but it's not a big deal. I usually just sort of tug at it or wear a slip under the bustier, and that helps.",B0002B6PHY
Good quality but it fit a little tight but it's very nice,B0002B6PHY
"I ordered this bustier to go under my wedding dress. I am 5' 9"" and 150 pounds. I'm not fat by any means, but I was looking for something to streamline my torso and give a little lift to the girls while being invisible under my dress. The price was also a plus. I ordered my usual size 36B and the sizing was completely skewed. It ended up being way too loose around my tummy area (where I wanted to suck it in a bit) and I couldn't even fasten the top 5 hooks where my bra would fasten normally. Not to mention the cups have no real padding and had room to spare. they were more designed for a C or D cup rather than a B. The boning in this would completely show under my dress as well. Ordering a size up wouldn't help seeing as there would be even less support around the stomach even at the tightest notch. I returned this, better luck next time.",B0002B6PHY
Was true to size but needed help getting into it.,B0002B6PHY
...ou those stays and middle are tight.,B0002B6PHY
"did not fit properly, did not give a guideline as to sizing, very different than my true bra size",B0002B6PHY
"I'm a seamstress and bought this for a client to wear under her wedding gown.  She's tiny, curvy, and hard to fit.  This bra was perfect, it went down over her hip enough to smooth the dress, the cup was perfect on her, and it managed to still allow her to breath and sit down.",B0002B6PHY
Too small at the moment but exactly what I wanted and expected.,B0002B6PHY
Liked the product but ran very small according to size,B0002B6PHY
"This bustier is well made.  It was exactly what I was looking for, but it was too small.  I normally wear a 34 or 36 so I ordered the 38 after reading other reviews.  But this bustier was still about 3 inches too small.  Definitely order a larger band size.  The cup size was ok, but also on the smaller side.",B0002B6PHY
"The bustier was a very good fit,and it provided good support under my wedding gown. The fabric is comfortable,though i would hv liked the colour option of ivory because my gown is ivory.e",B0002B6PHY

"Although the fit was tight, it works out fine. Ordered a larger one - it was too big, returned it.",B0002B6PHY
"Im not sure how this is considered a plus size. Its too small to be label plus size IMO. Boob shape is weird. Looks more cone shaped. However, for the price it is a good buy. Still gets the job done.",B0002B6PHY
"I ordered according to the sizing chart and was still too small.  As a larger woman, it was frustrating when it wouldn't fit around your waist, although you know the actual cup size was correct.",B0002B6PHY
It was a tad small but I was able to make it work! Overall it was really good quality.,B0002B6PHY
Fits perfectly after buying a size up in the band. I normally wear a 38DD and a 40DD fit just right! Im so happy this worked out after I have bought several others and could not find the right size!!,B0002B6PHY
"this may be the ugliest thing I've ever tried on. the cups were bullet shaped so they were hideous and they were very tall, but not wide enough. it was itchy and uncomfortable.

"These coveralls are great for playing paintball in. They have a lot of neat pockets and straps, and the best thing is that when your done playing you can jump out of your clothes and into what you wear underneath it (I usually wear basketball shorts and a t shirt).

In my experience I found these flight suits to be troublesome because they are one piece, and they come in standard sizes. What I mean is that for me, the length between the crotch and the shoulders was too short and resulted in a very uncomfortable fit, but It might be because I'm 6'3"" and these BDU's are just a standard fit to fit MOST body sizes. I fixed it by adding a band of fabric around the waist. Also, these things can get real hot, hotter than regular BDU's. I fixed this by making the band I added out of camo mesh, and also replaced the underarms with camo mesh to let the suit breath.

All in all though this was an excellent product, and my whole team started using them after they saw mine.

On a side note about camo stuff. Unless you get it used, the camo pattern is too bright for effective camouflage (Unless you live in the most verdant of jungles). Dull the color by scouring it and throwing it in the wash multiple times.",B0002CKD76
"I needed a camo romphim for a party, and this was the easiest solution.  Just cut sleeves and legs as desired.  The ladies loved it.",B0002CKD76

"This is a nicely colored, lightweight flight coverall. I liked it so much when I first received it, I ordered another one. After the first wash on one and the third wash on the other, they both are separating at the seams in different places. One eighth inch more material at the seam when sewed would have prevented this. Poor quality control and/or just being cheap. (Chinese junk). CEO wanted an extra $5.00 in his/her bonus. Also the Velcro will never hold up. If it was $24.95 it might be tolerable having to repair two new suits. But at $42.99 it is not. It does not say much for Rothco products going forward.",B0002CKD76

"The suit is rather minimal, fabric with zippers and pockets and no lining. However, It is durable and quality enough to last. I imagine most of us looking here are not looking for a hundred dollar suit, just something to get us by. This suit does that. I do worry a tiny bit about the zippers, but overall, I love this.

I'm 5'5"", 135 lbs. I bought an X-small. I still need to be sure I don't step on my pant legs and I added my own corset lace on the back to bring in the excess space around my torso.",B0002CKD76
"I purchased this item to use as an astronaut to costume, and it will work perfectly for that purpose.  The material is brightly colored and lightweight, but feels sturdy and the stitching all appears well done (time will tell).  Zippers all operate smoothly. A standard belt can be run through the waste band.  My one complaint is the velcro on the wrists and belt could feel a bit more secure.  I may stitch it down at the appropriate size.  It has a number of pockets from the chest, and arm, down to the thigh, calf and ankle.  The zippers in the area of your trouser front pockets are only access zippers to your trouser pockets (if you deem it necessary, you could conceivably stitch in pouches behind the zippers).  I am 6'3"" 230lbs and the XL fits like a glove: the shoulders to crotch, and length to my wrists and ankles is just about exact.  If it was any smaller it would not fit, and I probably can not wear heavy weight clothing, or loose fitting pants underneath it.  If I needed another inexpensive flightsuit style coverall in a color offered by this brand, I would consider purchasing it again.",B0002CKD76
"Waste of money. The fabric was thin, the zipper was cheap. The size it claims to be runs way too small. Not only that but when I tried it on it about squeezed the coins out of the coin purse if you follow. It needs to be longer. This is not quality. Buy a different jumpsuit or flight suit. If you insist on buying get the suit 3 sizes bigger than you usually do.",B0002CKD76
"Everything fits well for a medium, but the forearm and calf area is very baggy compared to the rest of the suit's fit, with no adjustment straps",B0002CKD76
"I'm 5'10"", and about 200lbs, but with broader than avg shoulders. This fits pretty well for off-the-rack. It's got enough room in the legs/arms for someone a few inches taller.

MY PERSONAL FEELINGS ARE THESE COVERALLS SHOULD NOT BE SOLD FOR  MORE THAN $25.00 to $28.00.  THE ONLY GOOD THING  WAS CORRECT SIZE AS LISTED.,B0002CKD76
"So I really love this, but it is small. I typically wear XL everything and it fit, but it was not comfortable to wear even with shorts and a tshirt underneath. I went up 1 size and it fit a lot better. Profile of me 5'9"" 220 lbs, 38 x 30 pants. Hope this helps so go from there.",B0002CKD76
"it works but I think they run a little smaller than what they should be. Nonetheless, quality is nice.",B0002CKD76
"Pretty good suit for the money, but sizing is an issue.",B0002CKD76
"Easy. Utilitarian. Slide it on, and you're ready to get things done. I am 5'9"", 160 pounds, and the construction of the shoulders and lengths all fit as expected. My only gripe is that the placement of velcro on the sides is not in a position that allows for tightening. They really do nothing for a person with an athletic build. I added a camo belt to solve the problem.",B0002CKD76
did what it as advertised for used as a costume,B0002CKD76
runs a little small so may want to go a little larger than your normal size like 1 up,B0002CKD76
"I chose this unit for the color, and I was very satisfied with the product. If you are working on your own home made X-wing pilot costume (soon to be outdated - the tragedy!) then this is the flight suit you ARE looking for.",B0002CKD76
"This Air Force Style Flight Suit designed is good, and the color with the size is good too, it's better for me to wear it to do the wall paint.",B0002CKD76
Fit good was just what i expected,B0002CKD76
Plenty of room; not enough inseam and I'm only 5'11. Shoulder to crotch was not what you would expect from 2XL size,B0002CKD76
"Like most other reviews of this item, I was worried about the ""wedgy"" issue. Apparently we all have longer torsos than those who are supposed to wear these things. I wouldn't want a larger size, overall it mostly fits... if I don't wear pants on underneath and pay close attention to how I sit down. Just another inch or two of clearance would make all the difference (and comfort!)",B0002CKD76
"This camo pattern is perfect for my area,  not too dark, not too light.  I ordered my size from the charts given on the order form, and it's still a bit too tight.  I will still be able to use it, just won't be able to get too many layers of clothing on under it for warmth.",B0002CKD76
"The suit is high quality, however the sizing is off in a critical area...the crotch. Get a size larger if you are tall otherwise you're singing soprano.",B0002CKD76
"I'm 6 foot 2 inches , and these are sized a bit smaller than you would expect for a xxl . I purchased some Dickies brand and they fit as expected.  I would suggest that someone purchasing this brand by a size larger than wanted ...",B0002CKD76
"The suit is really nice, but there is nowhere near enough room between the shoulders and crotch. I'm 5'10"" and it is unwearable as is.",B0002CKD76
"The jumpsuit is nice and light (if that is what you are looking for) and the zippers and everything are in perfect working order.  Sizes seem to run just slightly small, but pretty spot on.  Great for a costume!",B0002CKD76
"Crotch fell between knees and ankles; legs 12"" too long.  Supplier needs to provide more than chest dimension to assure a reasonable fit.  Not many people have body trunks longer than their legs.",B0002CKD76
"The fit is a little small, as in short in the torso. The length is fine, but it pulls at the ... crotch area. Had we gone up a size, it would have been way to big everywhere.
All in all, though it is good for the job intended.",B0002CKD76
"I bought this as part of a costume and have to have assistance getting into and out of it because it is so short in the torso,(Hard to get my shoulders in and out of the suit without cutting off circulation to other parts of the body), Other than that the fit is perfect!",B0002CKD76
Bought for a costume. As a woman it's super long but too tight across back and chest.,B0002CKD76
"Do not purchase this outfit if you are a 5.10'-5.11' proportional body white/cocasian guy, because this outfit is to small in the crutch. Believe me this is. I have read a similar review  before buying thinking that there are more positives than negatives, but in the end it's not what I wanted. Probably designed and manufactured for Asian nationalities.",B0002CKD76
I got this for a costume project that my husband is working on. it fits perfectly and is just what he needed!,B0002CKD76
"Not for the tall. I am 6' 2"" and these are too short. I have 32"" inseam. The length from shoulder to groin is not comfortable. I even tried the 3X, but no luck. They are bigger around, but not taller.

If you have a shorter torso, you could be pretty rotund and still fit in these.

Some people complain these are too thin. I wanted these for bowhunting and/or gun hunting, with layers underneath later in the season, so I thought the thickness was great for what I was expecting. These are not thick coveralls you would want to wear crawling up a rocky mountain face.",B0002CKD76
overall i like this jumpsuit. i use it for paintball and its perfect for that. tons of pockets and vents. the only problem i had was every time i crouched id get a wedgie. im 5'9 and average build so hope that helps,B0002CKD76
"This Camo jump suit fits perfectly. I ordered an Extra Large. I'm 6', 212 pounds, 35"" sleeves, 38"" waist, 46-47"" chest, 19 3/4"" neck. For me,this jump suit is a perfect fit. I will say when you first take it out of the plastic wrap it comes in, you'll sense a chemically smell so I would suggest hanging it in the open air for weeks and then, when you don't smell the suit anymore, pack it in a box with cedar or other pine bows for as long as possible before wearing this on a hunt. As it comes, a bear would smell this suit a mile away. But it's fine. Just air it out and get it scented with natural pine and you'll be good to go.

Coincidentally, this jump suit came the very same day my two, new Brooks Brothers suits were ready for pickup. I think they represent what is called a case of juxtapositioning for purposes of contrast:-)",B0002CKD76
"I'm 6'3"", so I went up a size and hoped it would be enough to make this work.  It doesn't.  I might be able to get it on, but it would be very uncomfortable.  It isn't the vendor's fault, it is hard to find things like this in big and tall.",B0002CKD76
Using the measurements provided should help you pick the right size. Fits well although tend to be a bit long. The zippers at the bottom of the pants leg help alleviate that problem.,B0002CKD76
The suit itself is made fairly well. It was the snug fit in the groin area I did not like. I am tall and even though I got the right size for going round me...it needed to be sized better for taller people.,B0002CKD76
The suit was smaller then I needed.,B0002CKD76
"This coveralls look good and have ample pockets for storage.  They appear to be durable and the zipper works well.  Unfortunately the sizing on them is very strange.  As other reviewers have noted, the torso portion of this suit is extremely extremely short, while the legs are normal length.  This means that the suit ends up being extremely uncomfortably tight around your... err... vital regions.

Unfortunately the tightness meant that I couldn't use these for any work application, as sitting, squatting, or even quickly moving was completely out of the question.

For sizing reference, I'm 6'1'' and bought the XL.  I think I have fairly standard torso to leg proportions. The coveralls were baggy everywhere except the most important place...",B0002CKD76
"The suit is reasonable, considering the price. It didn't fit quite as well as I expected, but that's more my fault than Rothco's. I should have consulted the sizing chart more carefully.

The chief complaint I have on this suit is the durability. I really didn't wear it that much, but the material and craftsmanship is mediocre at best. Again, I didn't expect superb quality for the price I paid, but it still isn't a great product.

My main concern is that this is designed to be a work-grade flight suit, but I don't know that it would function well over time. I recommend spending a little more money and buying something more durable if you plan on using it extensively.",B0002CKD76
"I bought this Military Airforce Style Flightsuit Coverall for my son so he could wear it to one of his DJ shows. He first said a medium would be perfect, but i said that a large would be good because adjustments could be made. If you are going to buy this product, buy a size that is one larger that the perfect fit that you think is, because this suit fit my son just perfectly (No adjustments made). Thanks!",B0002CKD76
"Have a Large size coverall from same maker and it fits snugly. This one has enough room for two of me in it. Had to alter legs, arms, move straps. As I said think I it was marked incorrectly.",B0002CKD76
I liked it cause it fit underneath all my gear. I never comapred this item to anything else because this is the first one I ever owned. this flight suit met my standards by being lil bit loose in areas I needed it to be.,B0002CKD76
"If you don't have a lot of money to spend on hunting camo, this is an excellent choice. I normally wear a large and purchased the XL because I'll be wearing this over warmer clothes. I would recommend the 2XL for this as the fit on the XL is a little tight with several layers of clothes underneath. Multiple pockets make this perfect for storing additional hunting gear such as hats, gloves, maps, compass, etc. It is cotton-poly and will probably last a couple of hunting seasons, but the price makes is a real value for the cost conscious hunter.",B0002CKD76
"I order and X-large... I'm 5'10 and 210 lbs (48"" chest, 19""/34"" arms, 18"" neck, 38"" waist, 38"" inch hips, 33"" inch inseam)...  this unit fits me perfectly everywhere but the crotch... it is about 2-3"" too short, so anytime I pick up my arms above my head or need to squat down, I get a wedgie (this thing feels like it's trying to neuter me).  Basically it fits like a XL-S (single X short)

I also have 2 of these in XXL, and they way are too big for me (too tall in the crotch and long in the legs and really loose fitting... feels like an XXL-T) ... so there's not a ""happy-medium"" with this product line.  I have other coveralls that aren't rothco, and they sell them in XL-S/R/T versions and I'm just going to stick with those brands instead.",B0002CKD76
"Works for coyotee hunting in Spring, Summer and Fall. A little light on weight (good for summer) but the price was right and have held up nicely for spot and stalk. One for me and one for my 13yo boy. They blend in well for hunting in sage around Eastern Washington.",B0002CKD76
"as expected, but the large size was little big. it can be easy fitted and made.

overall, it was great",B0002CKD76
"A solid product.  I don't use this everyday, but when I do it's never let me down.  I use this for either quick camo for hunting trips or to limit getting other clothes dirty.  They seem to be lightweight enough to work well in warmer months.",B0002CKD76
Much better quality than I expected.  I used it for a costume but it is worth keeping to use as a coverall,B0002CKD76
"I found this flight suit to be a really good product. Its color and pattern is great and has many pockets and such throughout. Even includes two zippers on the side of the suit so you can access your pockets beneath the suit. I sort of guesstimated my size and ordered a medium. Thankfully it's not too big, but still a bit baggy. I could easily fit a sweatshirt or two underneath the suit. Overall awesome product.

Update: Its been a couple of months since purchase and this suit still hasn't let me down, the material has held up pretty well. Still happy with purchase.

Update #2: It has been 2 years since I purchased this flight suit and it has definitely proved to be a great asset in my arsenal. I've done
a lot of running and sliding in it and it's held up relatively well. There is a little tear one of pant legs but I was running and something caught it, so it makes sense that that might happen. I have received multiple compliments from other Airsofters about the cool design and BA factor. It's definitely been a great suit!",B0002CKD76
"I bought it to be a Star Wars Rebel Fighter Pilot costume. It was comfortable and worked great. Lots of pockets, and can wear layers under it easily to adjust for colder temperatures. I am a curvy, size 16, 5'6"" woman, and if I did it again, I would probably buy a large, but this did well on me. It also fit a guy friend who wears XL and is a little taller than 6'.",B0002CKD76
"I'm 6'1"" and about 165 lbs. I ordered the large and it fits just a little snug over my thermal underwear. I use for shoveling and snow blowing in the winter. Nicely made and comfortable. I got the black and it looks great. Being an Air Force vet, I really like it.",B0002CKD76
I use this for paintballing. It looks fine and it's sturdy. It has plenty of storage space which come in handy.,B0002CKD76
"Okay, I don't know what everyone is crying about... I gave these a shot after reading the comments, the size guide (included on the description) was spot on!! Did you not measure yourself before ordering these?? Well I did and I ordered the exact size and it was a Medium. Fits perfectly!!! I am 5' 9"" tall and weigh 160lbs. The fabric is just fine, it is not cheap yet not Nomex. There is TONS of room with the pockets and I have been using mine in the mechanic shop at work. They have been beaten the hell out of yet work amazing still. If you are thinking about buying these, PLEASE measure yourself and LOOK at the sizing chart before you buy or you will be like everyone else. Remember, I am 5' 9"" and 160lbs and I fit perfect in the MEDIUM.",B0002CKD76
Bought this for warmer hunting. I'm between a large and extra large normally but got extra large to allow for additional layers. Fit is perfect to allow for lined jeans shirt and sweatshirt without being to constrictive. Can't wait to test it in the field.,B0002CKD76
Perfect for hunting and fishing.  Can use alone or over clothes.  Thin enough for summer.  Pockets and pass through to inside pants.  Would recommend.,B0002CKD76
"After reading the reviews here I opted for the 2 XL instead of XL so I wouldn't have height issues. At 6' 4"" it is still far too tight. The other issue is now it's way too big everywhere else. Good for a one time costume but that's about it.",B0002CKD76
"This jumpsuit is the quality I would expect of Rothco: great fit, lots of pockets, and a great, vibrant color.",B0002CKD76
"LOVE this thing - fits well, has one hundred pockets, and kept me really warm & cozy on a Top Gun boat party!",B0002CKD76
I purchased this product for hunting outerwear. I chose a size larger so I can wear it over my thicker layers. The size chart is correct and performs as expected.,B0002CKD76
"This is obviously fake, The camouflage the guy is wearing is MARPART, this is the Marine Corps' camouflage since 2002,Air Force does not wear this, the use a different style of camouflage",B0002CKD76
Would have paid more than 3X the amount at a local shop for similar or less quality.  It is exactly what I wanted.,B0002CKD76
"I was buying this flightsuit for my boyfriend's cosplay. It arrived in plenty of time, fit him perfectly, and worked great for the costume. He says he's also going to use it for paintball now that the convention he was dressing up for is over.",B0002CKD76
"Do yourself a favor and purchase a Tru-Spec, or a real used nomex flight suit.  I purchased one of Rotcho's flight suits, and the color isn't what is portrayed in the images, it was more of a mustard yellow than a tan or khaki.  Also after just one wash, one of the leg zippers broke off.  The suits also do not come with fabric pulls on the zippers like a real flight suit has, and the pockets aren't correctly placed.  The fabric is also very thin and will tear easily if you actually use them for any sort of rough activity like playing paintball.  Avoid these suits at all costs.  There's a reason they're only $40.",B0002CKD76
Product ran very small had to return,B0002CKD76
"It's well-stitched and put together, and suits me for my purposes perfectly.  I've got one that I've used for years as an airsoft CQB suit and for cosplay purposes and it's held up quite nicely for all the punishment I've given it.  Just bought a second one.",B0002CKD76
ran a little short in the body.,B0002CKD76
Arrived on time and works great for wearing my warm hunting gear underneath.  Saves me from buying more cold gear.,B0002CKD76
"Good product, runs pretty large",B0002CKD76
"Nice product, but the sizing is a bit off.... they run large. I ordered a small and it was too large and I normally wear small to medium adult clothes",B0002CKD76
"poorly made, very light weight, oddly long body and short legs.  Just overall weird.",B0002CKD76
Fits great and saved my Halloween costume idea. I was the most authentic Maverick at any party I went to.,B0002CKD76
Too thin good to block wind not for cold return because too thin,B0002CKD76
"I purchased these coveralls for my fiancee for Christmas, and I chose to order these ones off of Amazon to save a little bit of money. They are nice and warm, but the first time he put them on, one of the zippers on the leg broke off. You get what you pay for I guess!!",B0002CKDS0
"according to the specs in the sizing chart i should have ordered a 2x I'm 6'3"" and weight 300pds i ordered the 4x and it fits great i can extend my arms without the sleeves coming up and it fits comfortably over my boots the only bad thing i have to say about this item is that it is a little high cut in the crotch area if i touch my toes standing up it rises a little high in the crotch area but overall very nice coveralls!!",B0002CKDS0
My painter is not actually homeless but lives a survivor existance in the woods.  He was very pleased with it so I don't think you could find a better judge.,B0002CKDS0
My brother's Christmas gift again this year. He loves them!,B0002CKDS0
Perfect as husband works on the port,B0002CKDS0
The coveralls are made of good quality material.  They fit nicely (a little smaller than anticipated).  We expected a few more pockets but that was my fault.  The photo of the overalls is exactly as the item received.  Nice navy blue color.  Nice thickness of the material for colder weather.,B0002CKDS0
"Kind of a funky shape.  I measured my son & bought the right size, but the crotch is really baggy hangs SUPER low & the legs are short because of it.  But plenty roomy & otherwise well-made.",B0002CKDS0
This suit is excellent for cold weather and to minuver while working,B0002CKDS0
"Awesome, they was exactly what was needed and fit well",B0002CKDS0
"These coveralls are great.  Light, yet warm for our Texas weather. Bought two.",B0002CKDS0
Having to return runs small paid $74.04 only being refunded  $55.00,B0002CKDS0
They fit perfectly!  My husband is very please with them!,B0002CKDS0
Larg was a little to tight so I ordered xl but the front zipper was broke couldn't try on so sent back the next day,B0002CKDS0
So warm that I often need to leave it opened in front. Very effective when shoveling snow or trying to stay drive in sleet. Well made and very strong zippers. Wide opening ankle zippers allow me to put them on over boots.,B0002CKDS0
"I chose this for my husband because he needed something warm to walk the dog in because it was going to be a hard winter. He is about 5'9 and it is a little long in the crotch for him, but he really likes it and wears it everyday for that purpose. It doesn't look bad, but if I had known, maybe post some measurements instead of just basic size info it would have received 5 stars and I possibly would have purchased a smaller size. He wanted it long so he could wear layers underneath, but it is so warm, he doesn't have to. Overall it was a good purchase - he really likes the zippers on the sides for his boots and the good deep pockets.  I would recommend this item if the buyer can get a good feel for the measurements.",B0002CKDS0
"I recommend it for hunting or only for outdoor freezing, is very confortable and the material is very good. Cool.",B0002CKDS0
"I bought this for cold nights in Korea, and it works great, doesnt have but one outside chest pocket and its not a good one, so I cut the sides just so I could get to my pockets on my pants. This is a great buy to wear to keep warm and you don't have to wear much under it.",B0002CKDS0
"My husband got this for being outdoors in the winter moths to shovel snow, chop firewood, etc. He is 6'4"" and it fits pretty pretty well, but the arms could be an inch longer optimally. This suit is so warm that he actually wears nothing but his skivvies underneath it because with any additional clothing he is simply too hot. It's thick, but not too bulky and he can move around easily while wearing it.",B0002CKDS0
"I was not as excited about these coveralls due to the way the crouch area was cut. The way they designed the crouch seemed to be the issue with me. My body type did not work it at all. However, I would recommend, but be care of the crouch area.",B0002CKDS0
"For the price I think this product is very decent. The medium I think runs a little big, but it still does the trick. Very good product.",B0002CKDS0
"While shopping for Winter wear, I wanted something well built and that had closed, cloth ends on the arms that would keep the cold out. This was the only insulated coverall's that had sock like cloth sewed into the arms, all the rest had open ends on the arms that would allow the cold to flow strait up the arm into the chest. Quality is excellent, we bought two pairs, one for me and one for my son, on bitter cold days I would were hardly nothing under the coverall and be so warm I would be able to stay out in the cold long after everyone else went in. Great deal and well worth the price, highly recommend.",B0002CKDS0
the best choose i made need this last year the boots and the suit are great. recommend this to all that needs to stay warm(HOT) because you will be,B0002CKDS0
"The coveralls are very comfortable and is very warm. I've been wearing it for about a month now and is a little disappointed about the Cotton coming out of the material after first wash. Also the legs are short. I'm 5'6 and it comes right to or a little above my ankles. If you look at the picture closely as I'm looking now, didn't recognize it before, but you can see where the pants leg end exactly. Gave it 3stars because of the Cotton that's coming out of the material. Otherwise not a bad buy.",B0002CKDS0
Nice and warm not great quality but ok,B0002CKDS0
Comfortable for sure. Slightly hugs the gems area a little more than Id like but still a good product. I recommend,B0002CKDS0
"Works ok, is comfortable but not tailored very well- short legs and long crotch.",B0002CKDS0
Large was a Perfect fit. Im 510.,B0002CKDS0
Fits as described. Used it for hunting and kept me warm and dry.,B0002CKDS0
"This works great for the Ghostbuster's costume.
I gave it 4 stars because it was a little larger than I expected and so I had to place it in the dryer for a while in order to get it to shrink.
The material doesn't seem that durable but it worked well for Halloween.",B0002CKDPS
"I bought this as the jumpsuit to a Ghostbusters costume for Halloween, since it was cheaper than the actual costume and looked more authentic. I bought a small and it is a little long for my liking, but I just tucked it into my boots and it fit just fine.",B0002CKDPS
"I recently ordered this for a ghostbusters costume and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit.  I am 5'10"", 170 and I ordered a medium.  I was worried since many reviews said it was snug around the crotch, but it ended up being a perfect fit!

As far as the quality goes, it looks like better quality material than the ghostbusters costume I kept seeing online, and it's definitely durable enough to withstand a night at the bar or your buddy's Halloween kegger.

There are plenty of pockets for your keys, phone, wallet, etc., and the color and style is right on par with Venkman and crew's.

Would I wear this for a Bear Grylls style trek into the wilderness? Probably not, but it's perfect for a $40 Halloween costume.",B0002CKDPS
I didn't know what to expect. I ordered a small thinking if its to small I could use it for my daughters ghostbuster costume.  but I am 5'6'' and 135lbs its real baggy.  I think ill bring it in on the sides and maybe the crotch area up a bit because its real low.  I understand its for a man and to wear clothes underneath and not to be ghostbuster costume so no big deal.  Ill fix it :o),B0002CKDPS
"These are handy to wear around home for mowing and yard work. They have many pockets for carrying tools, phone, etc. I had to order the extra large for chest size but unfortunately that means the length is about 6 inches too long (I'm 5'11""). I guess if I put them in my boots like the picture that would not matter but since I don't wear boots that is not an option. The only real complaint I have is the color. Their idea of khaki is very different than mine. I had hoped they would be the light color shown in one of the pictures but instead they are the much darker golden color shown elsewhere. Because of the two different examples shown I decided to take a chance and unfortunately they are  the darker color which  I didn't want. Oh well...they're just for work. They are pretty light weight and hopefully will not be too hot while protecting my arms and legs from UVs.",B0002CKDPS
"Once the flight suit is on it is great and comfortable, however, it is  a little short in the torso so getting it on over my shoulders and getting it off is a bit of a strain.  I am not particularly long in my torso so someone who is would not be able to get in this suit at all.  Not sure if a 1X would be a better fit for me.  I wear the suit for mowing and it is very comfortable and cool even in 90 degree plus Houston weather.",B0002CKDPS
"We did go on the company website and review the measurements for this flightsuit, but it was still too large.  Maybe because it is intended to go over clothes???  Too hot here in Hawaii to do that.  My husband always wears a medium, as he is 5' 10"" 125 lbs., but this was way too big.  We've returned it, he has my small flightsuit and I ordered an extra small for me--5' 5"", 115 lbs.  Really do like the quality of the flightsuit.  Seams are well done, inside & out.  My only suggestion would be some way to secure the neckline higher.",B0002CKDPS
"This suit is not as good of quality as I was hoping.  Unfortunately the one I wanted was out of stock and this was my only option on short notice.  I figured since the price was the same, the quality would be also.  The fabric is thin and the zippers are cheap and don't work correctly.  Will not buy this brand again.",B0002CKDPS
"Opportunity of improving might be to fit rear pockets or side a hip level in lieu.

All other aspects are nice  I used as a work cloth and it is very comfortable and the most important fresh during hot season.",B0002CKDPS
"I ordered this for my ghostbusters costume for halloween, and it fits the bill perfectly. I originally ordered the medium, and I'm female and 5 ft 7 and it was huge! So I gave that one to my dad and ordered a small, which fixed all the problems I'd had with the medium. I had to sew on it a bit to make it fit better, because coveralls look good on no one, and it was comfortable and fit very well.",B0002CKDPS
"We used this to make a Ghostbusters costume and it couldn't have went better. After seeing poorly made costume sets...essentially plastic jumpsuits and blow-up proton packs, I decided to make my own. Wasn't too sure how this was going to turn out after seeing the mixed reviews on the sizing. I was pleasantly surprised...well made and fits my son great. Halloween was awesome and I owe most of that to this jumpsuit.",B0002CKDPS
"Good as a costume. Got an extra large because I'm 6'6"". Could have used an extra large tall. As that is not an option, if you are tall, go for the extra large.",B0002CKDPS
"I bought the Small size and it fits actually pretty well height-wise (I'm 5,7 and fit). The only con is that it's a little baggy, even the velcro straps to tighten the waist are too long for me :-/

Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase, though. I'm using it as a part of a costume, so I was expecting some amount of alteration would be necessary anyway.",B0002CKDPS
This flight suit fit me perfectly. I am 5'3 and have a 42 chest 35 waist and 45 hips. Id say if you are larger in any of those measurements to go up to a medium because It fit me about perfectly. The lengths for me on the bottom was not an issue because it was tucked in to my boots and the length of the arms was a bit long but keep in mind that I am short. If you are taller the arm length will probably be fine. The zippers are good quality and the material is neither to thick or to thin. For this price this flight suit is the one to go with.,B0002CKDPS
"We used these flight suits for our Ghostbusters costume this year and they came out excellent. Left to right in the photos are sizes: L, M, S, S.  I am a 59 man 180lbs and a small fit perfectly (second in from the right on the photo). My wife is 54 130lbs and the small was quite big so we had to take it in on the sides (Far right in the photos). I cant comment on how well they hold up to working since we only used them for a costume but they appear to provide a small amount of padding which is expected due to their slim profile.",B0002CKDPS
"Worked well for a Ghostbusters costume. Bought my personalized name from a seller on Etsy along with the patches. Very happy that I could get the suit online.
The proton pack...well, that is another story.",B0002CKDPS
Too large for the size that was advertised. Other than that it served its Halloween purpose.,B0002CKDPS
Arrived sooner than expected and was just the right size. I am very happy with this purchase.,B0002CKDPS
Made extremely well but a little big for a 10 yr old,B0002CKDPS
Very comfortable and durable shorts.,B0002DCT5Y
Love this robe and my new shadowline pajamas. They will be perfect for travel as they take up no space at all. So comfortable and pretty.,B0002DG8BK
It is lighter weight the I thought it would be and runs a little big. But wored for my 2 day stay in the hospital.,B0002DG8BK
"I liked the robe, however, I had to return it because my other wanted the long one.  I like Shadowline products...",B0002DG8BK
I ordered this to go with the gown I had ordered last year. It fits great and is extremely comfortable. I like the 3/4 sleeves.,B0002DG8BK
"Beautiful fabric and color. Looks delicate, feels sturdy. Love the light pink as well.",B0002DG8BK
Absolutely  a feel of elegance.  Washes and dries beautifully.,B0002DG8BK
This is a quality robe and fits perfectly.  I love it.,B0002DG8BK
I highly recommend Shadowline for any woman who is having change of life issues. The feel of the material is perfection as far as I'm concerned. It is cool and smooth to the touch and yet satisfying to wear in cool weather when worn in a gown and robe set. I am amazed at how comfortable this robe wears. Best of all it washes well and requires hardly any drying time. I can wear this all day and look presentable if anyone comes to visit. Especially since I have had both hips replaced and sometimes just want comfy clothes. Shadowline by far beats all other brands in price and quality. You won't be disappointed.,B0002DG8BK
"Love it! Fit was just right. Thick enough for modesty, but light enough to stay cool.",B0002DG8BK
"I really like this one also. A very pretty blue, like the ocean.",B0002DG8BK
"I bought this for my hospital bag for when I go into labor.... I love it... It's like the perfect granny gown, and it's really soft!",B0002DG8BK
"I'll repeat what I said about the matching 40"" nightgown:  I couldn't be more pleased. They're beautifully made, the fabric is wonderful, and the color is rich.",B0002DG8BK
Perfect! I always was fond of shadowline!,B0002DG8BK
"I just loved it, like I do everything I order thru Amazon!!!  I have never been disappointed about any item I have ever received.  Thanks guys!",B0002DG8BK
"Light weight, bought for traveling.",B0002DG8BK
These shadowline nighties and my moms favorite!  Nothing is softer and it has the best design.  Not see through but won't sweat in them either.,B0002DG8BK
"I purchased this for my 92 year old mother. There are few things you can give to an elderly parent that they appreciate.

The smile on my mother's face as she felt the quality in the material, stitching, and cut. The fit was excellent, it fell just right. It made her feel special all over again, right before she falls asleep, and will each night she wears it to bed.

P.S. Only recommended for those young in spirit;)",B0002DG8BK
So cozy & cute - exactly what I was looking for,B0002DG8BK
Beautiful.  I am so happy you are carrying this line.  I have 12 gowns & 4 coats.  I keep checking back to see if you have a new color for me.,B0002DG8BK
It was great and my daughter loved it,B0002DG8BK
Great product and the bright color grew on me.,B0002DG8BK
Very pretty. Rich color and fabric is decent quality. I also purchased the matching nightgown.,B0002DG8BK
"Pretty, soft, love the 3/4 in. sleeves, great length, just right for warmer weather. The color is a little more vivid than in this picture; I probably would have chosen a different color had I known. Maybe I'll get the black set, it looks very pretty.",B0002DG8BK
"I love it, and it was exactly what I needed for the hospital.  Coverage with some class.  The roses add a touch of class.",B0002DG8BK
Made very well. Attractive feminine but comfortable style.,B0002DG8BK
Got for my wife as a gift she loves it,B0002DG8BK
I've worn ShadowLine for years and continue to love it.,B0002DG8BK
I love Shadowline gowns. They are thick enough to be modest and yet feminine and pretty. This robe with matching gown look nice and feel good on. They also wash and dry well.,B0002DG8BK
I have looked for years at department stores to replace what I had and could never find anything I liked.  I love this.,B0002DG8BK
Bought it for my mom - 92.  She looks so pretty in it that she doesn't want to wear it but save it for special occasions (which at her age means overnight trips to the hospital),B0002DG8BK
I love my Vanity Fair gowns.  I plan to get a few more in the future.  We love the massage Bengay its a shame they no longer make it.,B0002DG8BK
Bought this for use while hospitalized. Just right as far as weight and ease of wear.,B0002DG8BK
"NOT SHADOWLINE QUALITY ANYMORE!!  This material does not provide the opaque feature which I prized.  Thin material that allows see-through which you can tell even by some of the photos that are well-lit;  you can see the outline and skin color of the model.
I am refusing to purchase anymore of Shadowline night gowns until they return to their higher-quality, opaque material.  I have older ones that have lasted for ages through frequent washings and they look better than the new ones I purchased.  I am beginning to feel that a lot of merchandise on Amazon is boot-leg or the company decisons to reap higher profits with cheaper workmanship, design and material.  I know a lot of people feel this way, but all we can do is refuse to buy.  Very sad for me because I loved the comfort and modesty of these pretty gowns.",B0002DG8BK
My wife purchased this as a gift for her mom along with the matching gown.  She loved it and always comments on how nice and comfortable it is.  Great value.,B0002DG8BK
Fits as described. Very comfortable,B0002DG8BK
My daughter and I both love the comfortable fabric and loose fit of the matching pajama set and robe.,B0002DG8BK
"Nice and lightweight, love the silky feel of it!",B0002DG8BK
It is a fine gown and well worth the cost.  We have been purchasing this brand for several years and have always been well pleased with the quality and fit.,B0002DG8BK
It's a gift for someone. It looked as expected when it came. I know the recipient will enjoy it.,B0002DG8BK
My mom will only wear this brand. 20 years going strong. You can't wear the material out.,B0002DG8BK
"Have worn (and bought as giftgs) Shadowline sleepwear for years.  Love them!  Great designs, styles, materials and construction.  Please don't stop making them!",B0002DG8BK
I like lighter robes. This one is well made and will probably last a lot longer that the other brands I purchased.,B0002DG8BK
"Fits well, nice material and opaque as stated. Pretty colors!",B0002DG8BK
"This was a beautiful house coat. Bought it for my Mother, she is older and doesn't like buttons. So I had to return this. She loves shadowline.",B0002DG8BK
Love the fit of shawdowline robes....Just enough coverage without getting hot.  Also appreciate the 3/4 sleeves.  Looks beautiful on..,B0002DG8BK
Used as baby shower gift for Mom for Mom. She loved it and do did hubby. Used gown too,B0002DG8BK
It's lightweight and easy to pack; Wish there were 2 pockets instead of just one.  A button came off after the first few wearings so sewed all of the buttons so it won't happen again.,B0002DG8BK
"I'd rather wear all cotton to sleep in, however I'm getting my hip replaced and I needed a short gown and robe. This set fit the bill and it's quite attractive. I've also read that anything silky makes it easier to slip in and out of bed post-op.",B0002DG8BK
"Little lighter blue than sapphire, but that said it is exactly as described.  Nice medium weight fabric...great for summer.",B0002DG8BK
"I had the gown and have loved it for years. The robe is a matching pale pink color that I love.  The robe has matching embroidered trim, great soft fabric and a pocket on the right hand side of the robe.  The length is just right, below the knee but not too long. Amazon's price was GREAT!",B0002DG8BK
This is the perfect cover-up for the short gown that matches.  Not too warm but a little coverage for cool or even hot mornings.,B0002DG8BK
"Beautiful black robe and the embroidery is wonderful! Feels so solky against my skin, and covers well. I recommend it!",B0002DG8BK
"I bought this for my 88 year-old mother. She is thrilled with the quality and the color (periwinkle). I had tried to replace her Vanity Fair nightgown and robe set, but somewhere I read that Vanity Fair doesn't make the robe anymore. (Why not???) I appreciate Shadowline's attention to customer wants.",B0002DG8BK
"Have had this robe  before in the past and is so comfortable, easy to care for and packs very well.",B0002DG8BK
I was very disappointed with the shadow line coat. It was not 3x like label said. It came way too small. Nightgown fits like it should but not coat. Don't purchase the coat.,B0002DG8BK
"Bought as a gift, she absolutely loves it!!
The bright color and perfect fit, couldn't be happier.
This was a perfect addition to her sleeping wardrobe.",B0002DG8BK
"I have worn Shadowline for years and was always quite pleased. My previous gowns and coats were roomier and a better quality, so they lasted and lasted. I'm sure this will ""do"", but quite frankly, this company like so many has allowed the quality to slip (no pun intended). They're riding on the name.",B0002DG8BK
"Lenght is longer than expected, so it has to be shortened.
the quality is fair, and not something I would buy again",B0002DG8BK
"I've bought shadowline gowns for years and they has fit well, was  very disappointed how small this ran. returned to supplier.",B0002DG8BK
I purchased this as a gift for a friend.  It is lovely.  Very soft and feminine.  I would definitely purchase another.,B0002DG8BK
Bathrobes that button are not easy to find. I bought this for my MIL who is a stroke survivor. She lost the use of her right hand and can't snap or tie a robe. This was the only one I could find that buttoned. I try to get things she can do to keep her as independent as possible. This worked perfect.,B0002DG8BK
"I wanted a robe that was the length of my gown, slippery, so i could move about in bed, pretty, and comfortable.  This robe met all of my needs .  I love it.",B0002DG8BK
The robe is exactly what I was looking for and I would recommend it to anyone who likes nylon or silk pajamas,B0002DG8BK
This robe and the two nightgowns I bought to go with them are the most comfortable material for sleeping. It has wonderful lines and fits perfect. I would recommend this to anybody.,B0002DG8BK
This is a beautiful robe. Material is silky and fit is perfect. It is very pretty and feminine and should wash in machine and drip dry which is what I wanted. I would reccommend this product to anyone.,B0002DG8BK
This is my second purchase of this shoe in a different color. Great look for the price.,B0002DG8BK
The fit is wonderful. Good deal for the price. Thank you.,B0002DG8BK
"My mother loved the color, gown and robe fit as expected.",B0002DG8BK
Well made and perfect!  This pretty robe has exceeded my expectations!,B0002DG8BK
"Lovely color and I wanted this to be roomy and comfortable and it is.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadowline-Women-s-Petals-3-4-Sleeve-41-inch-Waltz-Coat-Melon-2X/dp/B071S6SWY1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadowline Women's Petals 3/4 Sleeve 41 inch Waltz Coat, Melon, 2X</a>",B0002DG8BK
This is a great robe to pack for a trip.,B0002DG8BK
Too short. Fit more like a longish blouse.. .not for anyone more than 5'5''..,B0002DG8BK
Item arrived quickly as viewed on line. Item a little bigger than expected. My last purchase of Shadowline sleepwear was in 1992 ...... I am also still using that sleepwear.,B0002DG8BK
We bought this for my daughter's great-grandma and she is very picky with her gowns. But she loved it so we bought her 4 more. She said she can't find them anywhere!,B0002DG892
I bought this along with the matching nightie.  Pretty and nice EXCEPT it lost a button on the very first wash!! No extras came with it... Now what do I do?,B0002DG892
I really loved this robe but after one washing in my washing machine the stitching in the sleeve came un done.  I have sent it back to the seller for a refund which I am as yet still waiting for.,B0002DG892
"My mother was happy with the color and size; but it only has one pocket. She would have loved
 it if it had two. The material is soft and does not wrinkle.",B0002DG892
Got it for my mother.  She wears it every morning and looks good.  Good pockets too.  Washes and dries well.,B0002DG892
This robe fits just as I wanted it to fit.  It looks great on me and I love the color.,B0002DG892
Perfect for my Mom. She loves it! It's hard to find housecoats/robes to fit her. She is 82 and very tiny.,B0002DG892
"My mom says that Shadowline makes the best pajamas ever, and I was thrilled to find these for her.  We will keep purchasing!",B0002DG892
"Fits well, and looks nice. I love the fabric. Good deal for the money. I would like to buy anothr in a different color.",B0002DG892
"I have a teal gown size medium that fits well, and I ordered  the matching teal robe, size medium.  The robe was hugh, more like a large or x-large.  Tag in robe was medium, but this teal robe is not sized correctly.  I also order the gown and robe in purple, size medium and they both were perfect.
Sadly, I had to return the teal robe.

I love Shadowline and have several gowns and matching robes that are many years old.  The are very comfortable and never wear out.",B0002DG892
"Very nice outfit and fit is what I expected
It arrived in 2 days!",B0002DG892
"I would have preferred full-length sleeves but that's just me.  It fits perfectly, washes beautifully and takes up very little room in a suitcase.",B0002DG892
Perfect for warm weather. I vacationed in Arizona and it was just what I wanted.,B0002DG892
Just what I wanted; provides a very light cover over my (almost) matching Miss Elaine nightgown.  Feels smooth and silky; nice clear pastel pink color.,B0002DG892
"This robe is a beautiful color made of soft, comfortable fabric, and it fits true to side.",B0002DG892
Love it!  going to use it on vacation!,B0002DG892
I purchased this as a gift for a nursing home patient. It was just what she wanted!,B0002DG892
"Very nice robe. It is longer than it shows, which makes me happy",B0002DG892
"Nice, substantial material, don't think it will get pilly or snag easily..I ordered large first, but had to return for medium.navy blue, pretty color. This was my third purchase of nightgown and robe, so you know I like and think worth the price.",B0002DG892
"I have been buying Shadowline for years as good quality, always fit and wash well. Pretty color!",B0002DG892
Material was lovely but I think the sizes run large.,B0002DG892
"Got this light weight, small to pack robe for traveling.  After reading other reviews I ordered down a size.  So glad I did.  Plenty of room in this robe.  Love the sapphire color; not too bright or pale.",B0002DG892
I love Shadowline because I love having matching gowns and robes.,B0002DG892
She Loves the Feel and Softness !!,B0002DG892
the person it was gifted to said they loved it,B0002DG892
The robe seems to be of good quality. It is a good color. The problem is it is very large!! Not sure if I will send back or just try to use. Really needed it right now for a trip. Definitely miss the Vanity Fair robes!! Counted on VF for years. Sizing was always consistent. Anyone know where they can still be bought at?,B0002DG892
"Very nice...comfortable.  Disappointed it was not made in U.S.A....thought it was when I first viewed it but surely, I  must have been mistaken.  Seems to be of good quality anyway.",B0002DG892
"Color & fit were perfect. I love Shadowline gowns, too.",B0002DG892
Robe arrived on time and is as described.,B0002DG892
a bit shearer than expected so if your staying somewhere other than your own home wear something under it,B0002DG892
"I got this nightgown for while I'm at the hospital after giving birth. The material is very smooth and comfy. However, I'm 5'1 and usually a medium, which is what I purchased, and I'm swimming in this thing even tho I'm pretty much in my last month of pregnancy[160lbs]. The length was fine,it went passed my knees but, if you're short like me, I'd recommend going a size smaller.
I'm gonna keep it just cause it's comfy and it's not like I'm gonna wear it out but, if I was gonna buy it again, I'd go with a small instead.",B0002DG892
"Won't be disappointed in the quality of material if you have had Shadowline in the past, looks just like the picture.",B0002DG892
Love the Shadow gowns and robes!,B0002DG892
I love this gown so much I ordered the robe to match and am glad I.  The fabric and workmanship make Shadowline garments worth the bit extra cost.,B0002DG892
Fits great and is very comfortable.,B0002DG892
Always as expected - one of the few consistent products these days.,B0002DG892
Love this robe! Very pretty to put on if you have company when you are ill!,B0002DG892
I read in the reviews that this brand ran large so I ordered a size smaller than usual and it is fine.,B0002DG892
"Need a size larger but live Shadowline, great birthday gift!",B0002DG892
"I love it.  Will be taking it to the hospital for my next hip surgery.  I have learned the advantages of items that will slide across the bed when trying to get in and out!  I am 5'5"" and it came a little below my knee.  It is a little large but that works even better while I am recuperating.",B0002DG892
Bought as a gift. The recipient asked me to size down because this robe runs a little big. She usually wears an XL or 1X. The size large fits perfectly. Very pretty!,B0002DG892
"my 86 year old mom likes it. Covers well, and is a good length on her 5"" 1"" body.",B0002DG892
very comfortable and the color is so pretty,B0002DG892
Arrived when predicted. Item was a gift and fit perfectly! She loved it!,B0002DG892
"I purchased these nightgowns for a trip to the hospital.  I have worn this brand for many years.  I like the fit, color choices, and the size is always what I expect.  I recommend this brand to anyone.",B0002DG892
I usually only use this when traveling.  It fits well and I like the way it feels while wearing it.  What I didn't think about when I purchased it was that it has buttons and takes time to button it up and take it off.  I usually prefer robes with snaps or a zipper.,B0002DG892
"I have worn Shadowline for years. This is not the vintage luxurious material from decades ago, but it is still an excellent product. I have at least ten sets of gowns and robes in lovely colors that I have collected over the years, and they have lasted well. I wash them together in cold water on the ""hand wash"" setting. Since I am 5 ft., 2 in. tall, I choose the short robe with the long gown in the same color. It looks like a matching set, and I don't trip on the hem of the robe, which is quite long. My only negative comment, beside the fabric being less soft than before, is the price- expensive and rarely on sale.",B0002DG892
This robe matched a night gown and is exactly what you need when you travel.,B0002DG892
This is a beautiful robe. Fits great and is very comfortable. Great to sleep in.,B0002DG892
"Beautiful color, fits great and washes up like new ever time!",B0002DG892
I have always worn Shadowline brand in sleepwear.  Was glad to be able to purchase through Amazon and have a choice of colors.  I chose the purple because I have had most other colors over the years and wanted something different. Love this product!,B0002DG892
"High quality, lovely color, beautiful gift.",B0002DG892
This isn't my favorite style. I prefer the Shadowline robe that has a bias cut (satin finish) yoke. It also felt lighter in weight and more supple.,B0002DG892
Don't like it because you can see through it.  Material too thin.  Will be sending back.,B0002DG892
Shadowline/Vanity Fair are always my favorite. I am never disappointed. Always a great fit. Always great colors. Always great looks.,B0002DG892
I like the color and the fit.  The only thing I do not like are the teeny buttons.  But it is a keeper!,B0002DG892
I love this color and the fit is perfect for my 1X figure.  Also I have washed and dried it a few times and it wears well.,B0002DG892
"I ordered a medium for my mom and it runs large. Even still, she liked it. Comfortable and soft. The color is very pretty. Washes and dries with no problems.",B0002DG892
"I am very pleased with the robe, the fit, the color and it is well put together. I would give this a high rating to all my female friends.",B0002DG892
It is somewhat large but I like a room house coat so I can wear PJs under neath.  Nice fabric and color,B0002DG892
"It was a Christmas gift and is exactly what my mom likes; full button down the front, 3/4 length sleeve, just below the knee length",B0002DG892
"I really like this robe, bought it to go with the matching long nightgowns.  I guess I'm one of those women who started out wearing nightgowns years ago, and I just don't want to stop.  Love his robe.  Would definitely buy it again.",B0002DG892
"Very comfortable, have worn this brand for years. Thank you",B0002DG892
I love this housecoat.  Fits perfect.  Feels light and comfortable.,B0002DG892
Good purchase. Fabric is not flimsy. I'm thinking about another color...,B0002DG892
"I am absolutely happy with the item itself. The fabric is soft and thin enough to prevent constant hot flashes LOL, an issue I've had with heavier weight synthetic materials. The blue color I received is more of a sapphire blue than a paler pastel blue. The item is pictured on the Amazon site as a knee length. The one I received is a floor length robe, which is fine for me. If you are ordering this for a shorter person (than 5'6""), it will be too long and require hemming or a return for the shorter version.",B0002DG88I
"The robe is perfect other then the color is not exactly what I expected. I purchased the Rose colored robe but I believe I received the Rosey pink robe. If not, this Rose is very pink and looks exactly like the picture of the Rosey pink robe in the sellers photos....I believe my mother in law will still love it so I'm not going to return it.  Also, the thread for the petal embroidery is gray not white like I expected. Other then the color, it's exactly what she wants for Christmas and I think she will enjoy it.

4 stars due to color",B0002DG88I
"For summer I need a cool robe, and this one fits the bill perfectly. I like the length of the sleeves, and it washes great. Very happy with purchase.",B0002DG88I
I was happy to see that the fabric used in this shirt was of good quality and soft and comfortable and not some of the heavy and rough fabric that I've found in some of the sporting goods stores in my area.  Price and quality was better online.  Very happy.,B0002EDHWC
i got this for my husband and he totally loves it . everyone who saw it thinks its the coolest hunting item yet,B0002EDHWC
"Very pleased with the hunting shirt.  Fits well, great. No problems, got the shirt in no time, very happy with our order experience, we would order again.",B0002EDHWC
"I got this with midweight cargo pants for my husband to take on a Maine bear hunting trip in September and they worked great.  They came as sized and I got them cheaper and faster than any comparable item that ws available through Dick's or Cabela's.  Thanks, Amazon!",B0002EDHWC
"I live in Southern California and the nearsest place that I can purchase hunting equipment is hour and a half away. Even on Amazon there weren't to many choices in the area of hunting at a decent price. This long sleeve shirt is perfect or the beginning of the season or Southern California. There is a set of russel pants that match this shirt.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russell-Outdoors-Men-s-Explorer-Midweight-Cargo-Pant/dp/B00336G368/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russell Outdoors Men's Explorer Midweight Cargo Pant</a>.",B0002EDHWC
Purchased for my hubby to add to his Duck hunting clothes.  He hasn't worn it but I have washed it.  It is great quality and didn't shrink when washed.,B0002EDHWC
Got a short sleeve instead of long.,B0002EDHWC
"The shirt is the size you would expect, the material is thick and feels like it will last for years.  The print is very good and crisp.  Love this shirt a lot.",B0002EDHWC
"I'm (a woman, first of all) usually a women's large, but men's medium. Purchased a medium, fits true to my standards. The fabric is warm, and while scratchy isn't the word is use, it's not a soft material. It's also not stretchy. I also didn't see that it had a breast pocket until I received it, which doesn't bother me, but I have a hard time seeing it in the pictures without looking for it. It's warm, if not super comfy, and it's probably better for the outdoors anyway.",B0002EDHWC
"Great fit, great material and great pattern. Very pleased",B0002EDHWC
Happy to get a shirt that is 100% cotton but the feel of this fabric is a bit rough to the touch. My son loves it because it fits well and the print is just what he wanted.,B0002EDHWC
"The shirt is kind of itchy, but I can't complain because its not to expensive.  I bought it just because I love camo",B0002EDHWC
"Great fit for my son who likes the fabric and fit of the shirt.  I love saving on camo clothing and we spend the savings on ammo and the actual hunting (gas, food, etc.).",B0002EDHWC
This gift was perfect my loved it !!! its not to warm so she is able to wear it in the fall.,B0002EDHWC
"This shirt I ordered, seems well made, and I would order another one. The camo looks good on this shirt as well.",B0002EDHWC
"It has decent quality, looks good and it Does the job. Exactly as advertised. Can't really go wrong for the price.",B0002EDHWC
I am happy with my purchase. The shirt fits well and it matches all my other Real Tree AP camo!,B0002EDHWC
"I just got this shirt today and am very pleased with it. It is true to size (I'm 5'11"", 145lbs and a medium fit perfectly. I haveyet to see if it shrinks when washed.",B0002EDHWC

Perfect for archery season opening.  I am a female and it fit me well. Washed and it didn't shrink.  It was very nice,B0002EDHWC

The shirt is a shirt. There isn't really anything special about it. I would probably just been your one from the local walmart next time.,B0002EDHWC
I chose this rating because it was an excellent choice. The coloring and material were what I would have expected it to be. My husband loved it. I would recommend it to my friends and family.,B0002EDHWC
"I had ordered a large, but they were sold out.  I settled for a medium and luckily they were made big so it worked out",B0002EDHWC
Big Bang for the Buck! - Excellent Quality as expected for Russell products!! Totally Satisfied & Could Not Be More Pleased!!!,B0002EDHWC
I was dissapointed with the quality of the stitching. Ther were places on the sleeve that did not get any stitching. I had my wife sew the sleeve .,B0002EDHWC
Just what I was looking for.  Good quality for the price.  Sizes may run a bit large but not too bad.,B0002EDHWC
My son wanted camo clothes to hunt in and this was a good choice.  It is priced right for a kid who is going to grow out of it.  I am very happy with this shirt.,B0002EDHWC
"I ordered the breakout pattern and was sent the mossy oak pattern.

So don't think just because you order one thing that you will get it.",B0002EDHWC
"The shirt was great when I first put it on, but after the day of hunting it really stretched out especially the cuffs around my wrist and the neck area. Washed it on gentle with VERY little detergent and with a jacket, pants, gloves and more. Hung it up to dry and pretty much all the color is gone.",B0002EDHWC
really liked. I like their clothing and the quality finish. hope will be lasting and can use it on sunny days.,B0002EDHWC
"I ordered a Russell Outdoors shirt and got a Jersey shirt. This is not what I ordered as it is unlike the one I previously have that says ""Russell Outdoors"" as a label! Will be returning this; very disappointed.",B0002EDHWC
"I have purchased two of this shirts, after a first wash they both shrink, not happy with it at all.",B0002EDHWC
I ordered this because my husband had one of these shirts he loved.  I was happy to find the same brand and model still available. I ordered two shirts the same size as his existing shirt and they were smaller.  After one washing they fit like skin - very disappointed.,B0002EDHWC
"Good shirt. I bought it for the summer months hoping that it would not be too hot. I took the advice of some of the reviews and went with a M and it fits me real well (5'7""  170). The shirt holds the sweat nicely and doesn't burn me up.",B0002EDHWC
"Great material.  Covers the body as a shirt should.  Not quite sure the necessity in writing a review for a long sleeve T-Shirt... but it does have a pocket too!  I can put all sorts of things in it as I desire, of course unless the items I wish to store do not exceed the capacity limitations of the pocket.",B0002EDHWC
"The buttons here were of poor quality. It seemed to bring quite a few fibers upon first unbuttoning the shirt and created this kind of frayed look around the button holes. Other than that, it is a great fit (I am a small, 5'8'', ~150lbs) but I returned it due to the button issue.",B0002EJ0XM
"Used this for an OITNB costume. Very well made, crisp fabric, nicely fitted shirt.",B0002EJ0XM
"Needed to get a couple of shirts due to a bump up in weight and neck size. This was a fast way to get them here. For the price I didn't expect much. That's what I got. Good news, the sizing was spot on. Fit was neat enough for duty. Not so good; off white color, flimsy thread count and a soft collar that is hard to keep in shape.

It's winter and I'm in multiple layers; so this works out satisfactorily.",B0002EJ1AY
It fits great! My daughter got it for her Halloween costume.,B0002EJ1AY
Good product. Strong stiching and good quality. Military creases sharp.,B0002EJ1AY
"Too small and it shrinks, puckering as well.",B0002EJ1AY
This shirt is SO WELL MADE!!!  I will be ordering several.  I love them.,B0002EJ1AY
I bought this shirt for my son this Christmas.  I sewed his patches on and it looked great.  I was happy with the professional look.  He is an Asst. Fire Chief.,B0002EJ1AY
Shirt is not wash and wear.  Sewn in creases lay to both sides after washing.  Made in China.,B0002EJ0NC
Excellent for my use conversion to Rick Grimes walking dead sheriff shirt,B0002EJ0NC
"The shirt is a great quality, I purchased it to wear for a walking dead party as Sheriff Rick",B0002EJ0NC
I like this! I used this for sheriff costume and it fits me perfectly and looks pretty cool too,B0002EJ0NC
Thank you can't wait of Halloween,B0002EJ0NC
"This is a great shirt for the money. The color is slightly darker than what is pictured, but still looks sharp with jeans for everyday casual. The sizes seem to run true and the construction is very good. Have reordered.",B0002EJ0NC
"As advertised! Good, solid uniform shirt.",B0002EJ0NC
Used it for a ranger costume. Looks incredibly authentic.,B0002EJ0NC
"Looks fine, terribly uncomfortable. Definitely wear an undershirt if you're going to wear for a long period of time.

I'm rating low cause honestly for the price you can probably find a shirt that looks pretty much the same at like a Goodwill or department store for the same price. I just feel stupid for not having tried that first.",B0002EJ0NC
"Official-looking, and high-quality shirt. Material isn't the most comfortable, but after a few washes I'm sure ti will be fine. Sturdy, and seems well-made. I got this for a costume use.",B0002EJ0NC
"I bought this for my step-son for Halloween last year. It fit perfectly and he looked GREAT as Rick, from the amazing hit series, ""The Walking Dead.""",B0002EJ0NC

Too small around shoulders & arms. The material is very thin and cheap. Does not say Security on the front.,B0002EJ3YI
Needed to order another jacket as my team grew in size. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.,B0002EJ3YI
Exactly what the caption said it was,B0002EJ3YI
Product was good. Sizing was a bit strange. While sized at XXL they were VERY slim so I don't think it was a true XXL I beleive they were irregulars.,B0002EJ8KC
"Rough fabric, Large was too small for me and I typically get a Large. No clue why it was too small. I would not recommend this product.",B0002EJ8KC
GREAT SHIRT!  GAVE IT TO MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVED IT AS HE IS A BIG CAMO FAN,B0002EJ8KC
The shirt was a Christmas gift for my husband and he is very pleased with it. It fits well and is what he wanted for warmth.,B0002EJ8KC
a little ruff feeling hope it will soften up after washing and drying,B0002EJ8KC
"Very cheap.  Incredibly thin, stiff, and way undersized, even before washing.  Not worth more than $2-3.  Sending it back.  Don't waste your money.",B0002EJ8KC
"Good layering top ..... pricing is a good value.  As expected, lots of stretch in the material. Colors not as muted as shown in catalog, but more vivid and bright.",B0002EJ8KC
This item is too small - I'm a standard medium and this was more like a small.  Disappointed.  The quality is fine and will order a larger size.,B0002EJ8KC
"Not as expected,the fabric has a very unpleasant feeling....the tayloring is poor, cannot wear it...i will try the 60/40 ones which are much nicer...",B0002EJ8KC
"It is not termal , it is too cold and it is too low quality. I don't recommend this item.",B0002EJ8KC
"My Son Loves camo, so I thought what a great present.  Well he says that the shirt and pants are scratchy even after several washes with Downey .  He will wear them only if he has nothing else.  I was very disappointed that he didn't just love them.",B0002EJ8KC
"Looks nice.
Sizing is very accurate.
Seems to be made pretty well.
Reasonably warm material, wouldn't hurt to be a little thicker though.
Price is sane.

I wear one most of the day (18h+) and it's pretty comfortable all around, I really like the fit of the wrist elastic as well, which does a nice job of keeping the arm in place.",B0002EJ8KC
"i got a small,it fit fine, then i washed it and now i have a fantastic belly button shirt!!! so all my family can see my beautiful hairy midriff , but i decided to give it to my nephew as a present instead.  order one or more sizes bigger.",B0002EJ8KC
Time to buy some more for the winter in south america. Great presents Great price arrived on time we will keep buying Thanks,B0002EJ8KC
"i got this camo shirt for my dad , he loves it, true to size, but the material is a bit too rough on your skin, needs a few washes with a softener... other than that- a diesnd buy and a good value",B0002EJ8KC
"We bought this many years ago and found over the years that we wore this more than any other thermal shirts that we have. So we had to buy more this winter. We especially like the long sleeves that can extend to cover the hands when wearing this shirt under a coat or jacket, leave the gloves at home.  Rothco Thank You.  Amazon Thank You for this comment outlet :}",B0002EJ8KC
"Cheap shirt, cheap material, runs small get a size bigger than you think you should",B0002EJ8KC
"Shrinks a lot, be careful when drying.",B0002EJ8KC
"Too short for it's size, not long enough sleeves, waist band at my belly Button practically. This seller should be aware that in the USA XL should fit people who are 6 feet tall, we have giants here not petite Chinese.",B0002EJ8KC
I like the shirt and camouflage pattern but would order in one size bigger than what a person usually wears.,B0002EJ8KC
I liked the material. Poorly made though. Strings loose everywhere. Too long. Too tight in the crotch. Like...way too tight. Coulda been women's for all I know. Also it's a lighter blue than I thought it would be. I returned them.,B0002EJ7W6
"After needling our FD leadership about allowing shorts during summer EMS runs, they finally relented. I found these and they fit me just fine. Great choice.",B0002EJ7W6
I usually buy XL but these did not fit.  I ended up getting a 2XL,B0002EJ7W6
"i like these shorts a lot. The fit, materials, comfort, build quality are all very good.
The only change I'd suggest is to widen the belt loops. I tend to carry a lot in my pockets that can strain the loops. Since there are seven belt loops, I can't complain too much.",B0002EJ7W6
perfect fit and worked well for the need. Would buy more if had the need.,B0002EJ7W6
Good shorts. Wish it had the same give my 511 pants have.,B0002EJ7W6
I am an EMT and I bought these shorts so that during nice weather I wouldn't have to wear long pants. Although the waist fits a range of sizes they have adjustable straps on the waist to pull them tighter. They fit me (waist of ~30in or less) just fine with the straps pulled some. They have the same number and type of pockets compared to my long EMT pants. I am totally happy with them!,B0002EJ7W6
"This product is misleading, the sizes are waaaaay off. I have a wonderful brand new pair of shorts that are going to goodwill I guess.",B0002EJ7W6
Fabric could be a little thicker,B0002FEGG2
"I bought this for a friend that has a brain tumor and is undergoing radiation. Yes, she is losing her hair. She has a blue camo jeep and I thought this would be perfect for her. She loves it. The only drawback is, it is a bit thin. Overall, it works for what I purchased it for.",B0002FEG1C
"my mom ordered these for me for work. In a high dust and heat enviroment, these work great under my hardhat. I go thru 2 a day because of the heat but use them all the time. They hold up great!",B0002FEG94
Love it! Arrived super fast. Fits great and looks so cute with anything. Definitely a must buy for nature lovers.,B0002H6ZUA
seems to be of average quality. ordered a XXL but its more like a XL; best to order 1 size larger than you need.,B0002H71IU
"It was a great gift for my gran daughter who was a firefly in a play "" going Buggy""
One suggestion have the fireflies light up at night.",B0002H6YYM
"My grandson just loved this shirt, it has a great quality feel to it, sharp graphics, and best of all, it glows when he is outside chasing the firefly's.  Would definitely commend.
True to size fit.",B0002H6YYM
"This is a replacement for the same shirt that I wore for years (it was very comfortable and suited my style perfectly).  Sadly a dog managed to convert it to rag status and I've tried on a couple of occasions to find one like it.  Be sure to order the one from Earth, Sun, Moon (heavy cotton made in the USA) or you'll be disappointed in both the fit and the quality (several Chinese knockoffs are stealing the listing).  The original one is available thru Earth, Sun, Moon and is of excellent quality.......",B0002H6ZT6
"Don't buy this. I ordered a small got a medium. The color was wrong (Very dark), you can't even see the writing or picture. Also very thin. Manufacturer was no help at all.",B0002H6ZT6
"It's not green, it's pale yellow. Thin fabric.",B0002H6ZT6
"Love the shirt design; however, the wording/trees were not centered. For the price, I had expected better attention to detail.",B0002H6ZT6
It fits perfectly.  The color is nice and after many washes it is still holding up nicely.,B0002H6ZT6
"I am not T-shirt person and my selection of t-shirts is very small.
This t-shirt is in my selective collection. I like it.",B0002H6ZT6
"Very comfortable soft t shirt. I love the saying,may the forest be with you. I also like this color of green.",B0002H6ZT6
"Quality is good. Color as pictured, I wear it around sometimes still. Price is a little high for how basic the design is.",B0002H6ZT6
I do not like as well as the one I got at Cracker Barrel,B0002H6ZVY
"The back is a little funky.  I am having a hard time finding a good fit.  It's too tight or too loose because it doesn't really have any give.  But it could just be my head, so I don't want to totally diss it.",B0002H6ZVY
"this shirt is very nice.  the size is very generous in size.  I don't know how it washes yet, as it is a gift.",B0002KV5DE
"ALL IS WELL & I'M SLOWLY BUT SURELY GETTING MY SHIRT COLLECTION BUILT UP. JUST ONE THING, WHICH I KNOW WON'T HAPPEN, & THAT IS
I WISH THEY MADE THEM LONG SLEEVE, ALSO, FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE WINTER BUT STILL WANT TO WEAR """"HAWAII"""" ALL YEAR ROUND!!",B0002KV5DE
"Didn't like the material it's made of, kinda feels like paper. Buy the more expensive shirts made from softer material.",B0002KV5DE
"Priced right.  All cotton means it must be ironed, but washes well. No color fading at this point.  Would buy again",B0002KV5DE
Received shirts early... Way to go! will be getting a couple more at a later time  They look great! Thanks,B0002KV5DE
Love the shirt. I just wish we had more of a selection in tall sizes. There are a lot of tall men out there you know.,B0002KV5DE
"Good price, material was stiff, but it worked great for the jimmey buffet theme party, arrive fast, would recommend to friends",B0002KV5DE
"Maybe one of the best shirts I own. craftsmanship is incredible. Style and good looks too! It is a much better shirt than I thought it would be, and I'll be buying more of this brand.",B0002KV5DE
I usually wear XL but was told in the shirt description to buy one size larger so I did. It fits perfect and I get alot of compliments on both shirts> Thanks so much!,B0002KV5DE
The shirt was exactly what we were hoping for.  It is light weight and in one of the other reviews it said to order up a size and they were right on.  Great shirt and considering buying the blue one next !,B0002KV5DE
"This is a wonderful shirt -- exactly as portrayed.  I got it quickly, at a very reasonable cost.  I bought it for my son-in-law, and he was thrilled.  Great purchase.",B0002KV5DE
Nice shirt! Its exactly what I was looking for!,B0002KV5DE
Pictures can lie. Not a very good quality material,B0002KV5DE
"great look and fresh, very good product",B0002KV5DE
Nice fabric and good design. Purchased for husband for luau themed weekend. Many compliments and asked where we got it. Fit was good and with my husband being a tall guy there is always worry about shirt length but there was no issue here.,B0002KV5DE
This was a gift to my husband - he loved it and it fit as expected for an Aloha shirt!,B0002KV5DE
A gift for my brother. Does he wear it? I don't know.,B0002KV5DE
I don't know how it fits yet because it's for Father's Day. But the quality seems great.,B0002KV5DE
"I love Chantelle bras.  They have The best fit of any bra I have ever worn and I've worn a few over the years.  I like the two clasps in the back and they're impossible to find when you wear a 40.  If the price ever drops, I'll buy another and if you've never tried Chantelle, I highly recommend you try one,",B0002KV6AG
The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized!  The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup?  Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge!  One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west!  I don't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle.  Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff!,B0002KV6AG
"These bras are the greatest, glad I was able to find them again. They last long if you hand wash them. Glad I found them on Amazon, they are a little less expensive than when I purchased them from a well known retail store online, because they never had my size in the store. So glad that I decided to look on Amazon. Ended up getting one in black also. They are so comfortable.",B0002KV6AG
"I have worn these bras for years.  Ever once in awhile I will try a different bra but I always lose comfort or support.  I think these bras give a natural shape to breasts and hold them up without a ""point.""  The material they are made of is comfortable to wear.  This is a great bra for heavy breasts.",B0002KV6AG
"I love Chantelle lingerie and the Amazone bra is one of the best bras I have EVER owned.  This chic, beautiful bra came in black or white. Darn shame you can no longer get the black one.  After all, black bras are beautiful and if you are getting a Chantelle bra, you are getting the Lexus of lingerie!

The Amazone bra is very comfortable and offers excellent support.  With the proper care, Chantelle products will last you a lifetime.  Handwash them and let them dry naturally.  NEVER, repeat, NEVER put any bra in the drier!  You might want to use lingerie soap and a lingerie net in a gentle wash cycle if you choose to wash your lingerie in the machine.  Chantelle, a long established company known for their high end, high caliber lingerie does indeed make outstanding lingerie.  Any Chantelle product is an investment.  You will certainly get your money's worth out of any Chantelle product you buy.  I have this bra and love it!",B0002KV6AG
"To be upfront, the Amazone soft-cup is my favorite plus size bra; however, Chantelle quit making it in black.  Thus, I am left with purchasing the underwire Amazone model to get a quality, long-wearing, supportive black bra.  There is really nothing wrong with this underwire model; it is comfortable and supportive. It probably deserves 5 stars, but I think their soft-cup Amazone is exceptional.  Chantelle makes excellent bras, which I wash by hand, as they are an investment, but I think their quality materials and how well they are sewn, lending to long-wear, makes them economical in the long run.",B0002KV6AG
simply my favorite everyday bra.  top quality and fit.this bra lasts forever.  looks better than the above photo.  worth the hi price because it holds its shape after hundreds of machine washing. (do line dry),B0002KV6AG
Do not buy this bra!! There was nothing wrong with the fit! It was the overall quality that was very poor. The underwire pokes through the fabric after only a couple of washes. I bought several of these bras thinking I would eventually get a quality made bra. I finally gave up!,B0002KV6AG
Love the product but pricing is prohibitive.,B0002KV6AG
Never disappointed in a Chantelle.,B0002KV6AG
"My one problem with this particular style is that it has only 2 rows (top to bottom) of hooks rather than 3 rows, meaning the back strap is narrower than I like. Otherwise I like the Chantelle brand for sturdiness and because they are cut low enough under the arm so that the underwire does not poke me.",B0002KV6AG
My wife loves them. They are comfortable and provide excellent support.,B0002KV6AG
Beautiful bra! Excellent fit! Have worn this bra exclusively for several years. Never buy other brands anymore!,B0002KV6AG
I would've loved it but the underwire came out on the first wearing !!! I slid it back in and have hand stitched it but don't know if it will work for long ,B0002KV6AG
Great fit.  Very expensive but the brand that fits me the best.,B0002KV6AG
not a good bra for the price was really looking for a good fit  :(,B0002KV6AG
"For a size 42D, the fact that it has a two hook closure in the back causes me great concern, and the straps are narrow and all elastic.....also, for an $84 bra....it has two tags in the back that itch and that amazes me because most quality bras now have NO tags, and info printed on the bra itself.  The material over all is a bit scratchy, and I guess if I stand ramrod straight as the model in their catalog, maybe I won't have any problems, but the brief time I have had it on, I can tell this is not going to work for me.  Very disappointed.  Update:  I returned the bra and received a refund with no hassles.",B0002KV6AG
"Could not find locally and was a bit hesitant to order, but it fits perfect. Love it.",B0002KV6AG
"This is a LOT of money, and the cups 'pucker"" and really was not comfortable.  I am so disappointed and its already gotten replaced with another brand from the store.  Not happy at all :(",B0002KV6AG
These bras are not cheap. Occasionally you can find them on Amazon or Zappos on sale.  Nothing fits and feels so good.  There are many many styles and finding your fit and comfortable one is out there. Just have a little patience.  Worth every penny!  My girls are happy and when they're happy I have a happy day!,B0002KV6AG
This bra is my favorite. Fits well and provides great support especially on sides. So glad to find it on Amazon since cannot find in stores.,B0002KV6AG
"These bras are the best i have ever found!  I don't know how to explain except to say that all the other bras i had, especially the t-shirt kind would make my breasts hurt after I took them off.  These don't and plus they are very pretty!",B0002KV6AG
I've worn this style for more than 15 years. Love them!,B0002KV6AG
Great fitting bra. Wonderful uplift. BUT very expensive! I would love to buy another one but right now the price is prohibitive.,B0002KV6AG
"This is the best fitting bra I have ever had.....and believe me, I've had lots!  Seems like a lot of money to pay for a bra but this bra is well worth it!! The French seem to understand women's bodies.  Thank you Chantelle!!!",B0002KV6AG
"I love this bra and have been wearing this style for many years. It fits my body perfectly, is comfortable and provides a great silhouette! They're a little costly, but well worth the money.",B0002KV6AG
"It's a bit smaller around the body then usual. I typically wear a 36C but for this one I may need a 38. The back is a bit itchy, it may be the tags. The cup is exactly what I was looking for and it gives me the shape I wanted :)",B0002KV6AG
Comfortable as always.  Wish it came in more colors.,B0002KV6AG

I need to send these back and get a adult medium. I didn't mean to order a youth medium,B0002KVD6I
"Bought these as spanx for under a dress and they are REALLY true to size.
If you're an adult buying as spanx, go a size up than you'd normally assume would work for you. Yes I know, an adult buying youth shorts will be tiny, but you get what I mean.
They work for under dresses but go up",B0002KVD6I
They fit to size.  She likes them & they are comfortable.,B0002KVD6I
These are youth sizes and not adults. Bad purchase  made.,B0002KVD6I

Hi ordered adult med. got three pair of youh med. not sure postage cost makes it worth returning.  :(,B0002KVD6I
these are ok for your tween to wear under a mini skirt but they are flimsy,B0002KVD6I

Incorrect sizing  These are youth sizes. Not Womens. Wish I had read the reviews. Apparently this is a way for the company to regularly rip off the customer,B0002KVD6I
These are youth sizes! Amazon should specify in site; seems like others had the same problem.,B0002KVD6I
"It fits just fine, but if the goal is to have something that will handle smoothing above your waits, this is not what you want. It will cinch like a rockstar on the tummy. Legs fit a bit tight and become pinchy after an hour of wear.",B0002L4O54
This brief is perfect for me under my wedding gown. It has the right amount of support and I'm wearing beautiful white stockings so the garters were a necessity. Can't wait to walk down the aisle!,B0002L4O54
Perfect I absolutely love Rago!,B0002L4O54
I like that the straps for garters are removable.  Makes this shapewear versatile.  Product very comfortable for a shapewear.  I recommend.,B0002L4O54
"This is a classic girdle as classic as one can get, I must have mis-read as I was looking for a shorts style girdle with a hook-and-eye closure at the crotch. THIS DOES NOT HAVE AN OPENING IN THE CROTCH.
This is a solid constructed garment, though using the facilities is very difficult having to strip it off and then back on. There is no wiggle to pull the center strip to the side, just saying. This is not meant for wiggle room in that area.
I am thicker in the thighs and this does dig in a little when sitting, it's not meant to be heaven on earth mind you.

Does what it is designed for, does not give oomph to the derriere mind you. This is meant to flatten and smooth and it does.",B0002L4O54
"I just got these in the mail today and they fit perfectly! You can't even notice them under tight wiggle dresses, although the garter clasps seem to pop out a little bit, but I don't think that that's a huge deal. They're a bit difficult to get on, but once you get them on they are perfect. These are surprisingly comfortable, even with the boning in various places and it doesn't roll down in some places the way my other shape wear has. I love them so much I think I'll buy them in the other colors too. Just remember to check the size chart for Rago before ordering so you don't order something too small by accident. A 6x fit my 41 inch waist perfectly.",B0002L4O54
"I wear a size 20 jean and so I figured I'd order a 3X and have a little wiggle room. Boy, am I glad I re-thought that given the ""waist"" number in the sizing. I went up to the 5X and when I tried it on it was PERFECT. Plenty of hold, a struggle to get on, but once on it fits as it should. Everything is held in, I can breathe, and I look so much better in the evening gown I plan to wear it with. So, great value, but be sure to look at the number (5X **40**) and consider your waist measurement.",B0002L4O54
"Doesn't feel as if made for a larger person, such as my self. Keeping only because it is better than others tried and not great for $41!",B0002L4O54
Very good quality. Wish it was available in long/tall sizing.,B0002L4O54
"All in all, the product is good design and quality but it just didn't work for me. I have a short torso but this still didn't come up quite high enough in the back so it rolled down.",B0002L4O54
"Fits just as described. My natural waist is a 37 with more of the weight in the front and the 38 was perfect.
My torso is on the shorter side so this did come all the way up under my boobs but it makes it so I can wear my comfy bras without the back rolls. It all pulled me in amd flattened my stomach more than I was expecting.

I would totally recommend to amyone looking to bring it all in and feel sexy while wearing it.

Only downside is the boning seems short or may be my general shape on the sides. It hits me right above my hips and pokes out a little but didn't really mess up the shape in a dress.",B0002L4O54
"Idk if i measured wrong but man i couldn't get it over my thigh, and very rough material. rolls down. Returned.",B0002L4O54
"Great product. Good quality. I ordered a size xxxl/36 based off my waist measurement and it was a bit big so I exchanged for an xxl/34. I'm 5'11, fluctuate between a size 10/12 bottoms for reference.",B0002L4O54
Do not buy this unless you really do not need it cause you will never be able to fit in it! it is made in china. I ordered a 7X *as american women are somewhat normal and I would have needed a 1x here in the states. This product would not have fit a teenager.,B0002L4O54
"I does a great job with smoothing everything while being comfortable. It makes a huge difference, I bought it to wear specifically with one dress but have ended up wearing it with a variety outfits: skirts, dresses, pants. The only downside is that there aren't any snaps or other closure on the crotch so when you have to use the bathroom you have to pull up and down completely, which isn't hard if you're wearing the right dress, anything too form fitting and I'd imagine it'd be a pain.",B0002L4O54
"I wear a lot of white and black slacks living in Fl. These are great with the side pocket. They wash very well and they arrived very quickly. I would, and will,buy them again!",B0002LK64M
"Terrible rough fabric-not at all what I expected! very cheaply made = No lining so it is see -through white trouser!!!! I want to return it-but it might cost me.. I am quite disappointed in this purchase- wasted my money,
I could get nicer clothes at a local store and return easily if not satisfied. I regret this purchase -the picture so deceiving.",B0002LK64M

These pants are shorter than Alia's microfiber pants.,B0002LK9QM

I ordered these for my mother because the make was no longer available where she lives.  She loved them,B0002LK5QG
I have had these same pants for years and still love to wear them.,B0002LK5QG
A little thinner than I expected but very nice fit and looks very nice,B0002LK5QG
"Ordered 2 pairs, 1 of each color. One fit and the other is quite large.",B0002LK5QG
Very light and wearable. I do suggest drying on the perm press setting or they will wrinkle and need ironing.,B0002LK5QG
"Some have negative review however I think they are very nice.  Fit good, material as expected, drape nicely, wash up great.",B0002LK5QG
"I purchased a pair of these pants, when I was on vacation in alabama a couple of years ago. I tried to find them on the west coast where I live. Two years later the pants are still beautiful.

Love this particular style and brand of Capri pants.  I've owned several pair in various colors and they wear and fit well and hold up to lots of laundering.  Wouldn't be summer without a couple of new white Capris!,B0002ME6LK
Love the way they come out of the dryer,B0002ME6LK
"Comfortable capris, look and feel good!",B0002ME6LK

"I got my first pair of these pants while visiting family in Florida.
They look great and fit so well and hardly wrinkle at all.  I would have bought a pair in every color they make if I didn't have so many other pair of pants.  Got white so I can wear with almost anything.",B0002ME6LK

Nice and comfy . I don't mind if they are a little big .,B0002ME6LK
Very nice pants for the price.  I get sooo tired of finding expensive cargo pants that can't pass my wrinkle test - who wants to go around with wrinkles  all day?  So when these arrived from amazon  I was thrilled - these are extremely wrinkle resistant !!  The fabric is very soft to the touch.  Elastic waist.is so comfy.  I'm gong to get a few more pair - different colors,B0002ME6LK

I love the shirt.  It is cool in this hot and humid climate.  The one fault I have discovered is the breast pockets are too large and are always billowed out. Other than this the shirt is great.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought this shirt because I wanted a white, easy care shirt for traveling but I had to return it. The picture made it look like this is a solid white shirt. However, this is deceiving. Where there are several layers of fabric - like where the pockets are - it is solid white but everywhere else the fabric is so thin that it is you can see through it.  This made it look very strange. The shirt itself was fine and other colors buy not have this problem but since I wanted white it didn't work for me.",B0002MGM4O
"In spanish

Es exactamente lo que estaba esperando, el producto es perfecto excelente calidad.",B0002MGM4O
It was a size too large. I found the exact same shirt at an outlet in a smaller size and it rules. I wear it with no undershirt and the mesh and vented design keeps me so cool. Love it.,B0002MGM4O
"I love these shirts, but they don't have any fitting, just run too large and hangs like a tent on you. But being of gulf coast I still love them for ventilation they provide.",B0002MGM4O
All Columbia shirts are made quite well and are very comfortable.,B0002MGM4O
"Not remotely what I was expecting or trying to buy, also this is the single largest item I have ever seen in the size I usually wear.  I'm sure it's great for whatever it was intended for",B0002MGM4O
"It's a nice shirt however I would go potentially two sizes down, (one for sure!)  from what you are accustomed to wearing!",B0002MGM4O
"fit perfect, dries fast and super light weight.",B0002MGM4O
Fits as expected great gift for friend!,B0002MGM4O
Ordered the tall shirt and it is just long enough.  It fits really big through the middle.  Wish it had a more athletic cut.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought this for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loved it! He's a large in T-shirts, so based on other reviews, I bought him a medium which fits him perfectly. He loved it so much he bought another one! It is great for the beach, lake, or working outside because it is sun protectant and allows air in.",B0002MGM4O
This is a perfect shirt for warm weather traveling. It is light weight and comfortable. Works with shorts for sightseeing or pants for dinner. My husband likes to wear his shirt tails out so he liked the straight bottom.,B0002MGM4O
"Fits perfectly, needed to get 1 size smaller since they run big.",B0002MGM4O
"The Cotton in this Bahama is far softer than the supposed cotton of the Bonehead from Columbia, which is stiffer and feels more like polyester!",B0002MGM4O

The shirt is good quality and fits well.,B0002MGM4O
"Fits and hangs very well, easy wash&dry. Thanks, will buy other colors soon",B0002MGM4O
Great fit. The tall length for a 62 man is just right.,B0002MGM4O
It is everything I was hoping for and a good buy.,B0002MGM4O
Fits well and full cut under the arms,B0002MGM4O
It was a gift I think he will like it,B0002MGM4O
I like this product but prefer the long sleeve version,B0002MGM4O
"Husband played linebacker in school and wears an extra large. He said it fits pretty good but just a tad small for him. Then again, he has a big build. We decided to keep it as it was not so tight he could not fish or wear it. This material is very thin which is what we wanted and it has SPF and air vents. I wash on warm, delicate and hang dry to make them last longer.",B0002MGM4O
"Great quality, make sure about size, all my shirts are large and this one on large is larger than normal, I can easily fit on a medium otherwise great shirt.",B0002MGM4O
Fits perfect! Really love the design and color. Im 57 and 80kgs and ordered xs size,B0002MGM4O
Love this color and it fits great!!!!,B0002MGM4O

Just a little bit larger than expected. Fabric is another material than a previous I have.,B0002MGM4O
Mi shirt have a big hole in the neck,B0002MGM4O
It is very good. i use it often.,B0002MGM4O

Cool shirt.  Lets air in and is breathable.  Definitely will help you stay a little cooler in hotter weather.,B0002MGM4O
Light and airy to wear.  Just as I expected. JG,B0002MGM4O
Really like me the fit. Very true to size.,B0002MGM4O
The shirt is pretty thin so you will need a t-shirt under it to wear it which means in the summer here in Fl it's useless. For the price I thought it would be a heaver material at least not see through.,B0002MGM4O
This is an awesome shirt... the only need I have is it not quite long enough for a tall....,B0002MGM4O
I feel comfortable wearing this brand and model!... Color is the same as in the pics,B0002MGM4O
"Love this style of shirt ... material, fit, quality!",B0002MGM4O
Loved the shirt.  Took it on a fishing trip and it was great.,B0002MGM4O

"Great shirt, good fit.  If it were available in more than one color in my size, I'd add a fifth star.",B0002MGM4O
The color is perfect and the fitting was true to the size...Material was iron free.. No wrinkles...,B0002MGM4O
My husband loves it! He wears a 3XL (62 and 350lbs),B0002MGM4O
I can get a comment yet as I am giving this item to my  son for Christmas and it hasn't been yet...sorry,B0002MGM4O
Awesome shirts.  Perfect for AZ.  So much cooler and more comfortable when outdoors in the heat than a cotton TShirt.  Wish I would have had these years ago.  Very nice looking as well.,B0002MGM4O
"Love it. Quality shirt, very comfortable.",B0002MGM4O
The shirt fit good and is well build happy with the price and quality,B0002MGM4O

The most comfortable shirt in my closet,B0002MGM4O
Everything OK and very comfortable clothes,B0002MGM4O
I have purchased several of these shirts as they are perfect for this south Texas climate.,B0002MGM4O
I bought several of these shirts.  There's nothing like a Columbia.  I love them.,B0002MGM4O
If you are trying to get that Jeff Probst look.. this is it!!!,B0002MGM4O
Its geniune but should buy a size down,B0002MGM4O
Love this shirt!  Fits hubby well & love the color!  It is light weight & just looks great!,B0002MGM4O
"I find these Columbia shirts run a tad larger than typical. Perhaps they are more true to size than other brands. Otherwise, look great; good construction. Would purchase again but one size smaller!",B0002MGM4O
"Shirt works great, Price was right",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt to wear on the boat or on a hot day. Lightweight and very breathable material.,B0002MGM4O
"Love these nylon shirts. Great for warm weather travel. Can be washed out by hand. They dry quickly if the weather isn't too humid, but will usually drive overnight even if somewhat humid. If you don't ring them out, hang them wet, and smooth out the fabric with your hands, they are quite presentable to wear without any ironing. The back yoke is vented.  Front breast pockets have Velcro to secure the flaps and drain holes in case you go in the drink. Button-down collar. So many colors to choose from too and I've received many complements from friends and strangers when wearing a pleasant bright color. The shirt's color will fade slightly after repeated washing, but you could minimize this by not machine washing. The slight fading is not a big deal in my opinion for a pastel casual travel shirt. Obviously, you won't have that issue with white or some of the very dark colors. These shirts are very light to pack and can be rolled and placed in packing cubes.  I'm hoping Columbia keeps making these for some time to come. Last word - these shirts run a bit large.  I usually like to purchase all my shirts in size 'Large' since I prefer my shirts a bit loose fitting, but in the case of these Bahama II shirts, I've order them in size Medium and they fit perfectly.. Still loose fitting, but not overly big.  I suggest ordering one size smaller than you usually wear.",B0002MGM4O
Fits large.. I got a medium for my husband who usually wears a large. It still has a lot of room. I love it on him.. Nice,B0002MGM4O
"Ordered this shirt for my husbands birthday present along side another Columbia style shirt and Im very pleased with it! Though, I was going to order a MED but read on previous reviews they run big so I decided to go with a SMALL.",B0002MGM4O
Great fit and great price also for this brand shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"Just a little brighter than depicted, but we love it.",B0002MGM4O
"Please note that sizes run very big. If you are a regular large, order the medium size",B0002MGM4O
"The shirt was great, but the sizes do run a little big.",B0002MGM4O
Was needed for a wedding. Color and fit was PERFECT. Most comfortable shirt you can wear in humid environments.,B0002MGM4O
Good product but not the same material that I own.,B0002MGM4O
order one size less than you wear. It is very hot where I live and this shirt is no fun to be in.,B0002MGM4O
Fit and color were great!  Great quality.,B0002MGM4O
"cool and comfortable, well made. Great on these hot days",B0002MGM4O
It was a gift for my son-in-law and he loved it.  I will be getting more for him in the future.,B0002MGM4O
Great fit in casual wear. I like it a lot.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirts. I've bought 4 total. I really like them.,B0002MGM4O
"It was a gift for my boyfriend, he runs Large but I bought M and still runs a little big",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. I bought it to wear on the beach during my Miami vacation. Love how it keeps you cool and blocks out UV rays.,B0002MGM4O
wow did i sweat with this shirt. it lets the air in big time which means no insulation from the heat. i was dripping in sweat. wear an undershirt. horrible.,B0002MGM4O
Size is way off. I wear a medium but this small fit like a medium. Only shirt I wear in Southeast Asia. Keeps me cool but never use fabric softener. It coats the shirt with animal fat and closes the cells stopping air movement. Wash and hang dry only. I used to send to the laundry man in Bangkok but they melted the shirts with a hot iron. Wear yellow for the Thai King's color on Mondays and holidays.,B0002MGM4O
Wonderful casual collared alternative to a polo. Comfortable lightweight easy wash great for travel and flattering casual option that can go from hiking to fishing to dinner out. We have purchased multiple colors. People will stop your man to ask where they got the shirt! Also appropriate for women's sport and hiking if the size is right! Great shirt!!!,B0002MGM4O
A bit larger than standard sizing...but the shirt is great***,B0002MGM4O
have several of these shirts and they are great.,B0002MGM4O
"a gift
Product/Seller seem Fine

Note: I don't care for Amazon's 0/5 star ratings hence, to me, 4 is normal/good, 5 is almost never... (should be 0,1,2 instead)
The five stars set up expectations that everything 5 is excellent and all else is crap. Bad system...",B0002MGM4O
love it - comfortable! fits well!,B0002MGM4O
The fabric is bad quality and it was damaged on the first wash,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt  and that is why I now have different colors in my closet.,B0002MGM4O
"The material is of the type that you can never seem to press out the wrinkles ( I mean real bad wrinkles), other than that the shirt is good.",B0002MGM4O
"Nice fabric.  I see these shirts EVERYWHERE and on Big Men too.  I ordered XXLT with the hope of it being long enough to wear out and give me a long enough shirt tail.  It only widens the shirt....not lengthens, so I had to return because if you have big shoulders and are over 6' tall, these are not sized long enough as the photos suggest.  I'm just going to have to go to a store that sells all the sizes and see if I can find one that is truly made for Big and Tall men.",B0002MGM4O
Bought these for my husband - he loves them.  Lightweight and needs no ironing after machine washing.,B0002MGM4O
"Love these shirts.  Comfortable, nice looking too.",B0002MGM4O
This time the tall size is a little too long for me. Regular size is sometimes too short. It all depends on the shirt.,B0002MGM4O
Great light weight shirt....dries quickly .... fits great,B0002MGM4O
"Fits well, light weight, fast dry. Pockets are ok.",B0002MGM4O
Fit and color was as expected.  Nice quality shirt for casual wear.  Perfect for those 100 plus days.,B0002MGM4O
"I purchased this shirt for my husband's birthday, as I love it when he wears shirts in pinks, peach and coral colors.  The quality is very nice and the fit was great.  Would purchase more if they had colors in this same spectrum",B0002MGM4O
"Got it for my husband.  It fits perfect. Easy to wash,  dries fast with no wrinkles. He loves it.",B0002MGM4O
"The sizing is way off (too large).  I am typically a large and the medium is too big.  Too much hassle; I am returning the product and prefer to buy in person so I can try it on.  If sizing was correct, it would not have been an issue.",B0002MGM4O
If I didn't know how these fit I'd be upset LOL I'm a large in T shirts and a small in Columbia button ups. They do not shrink at all.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt overall; mustard color looks nice.  I normally wear an XL, but went with a Large.  Plenty of sleeve length and room in the mid-section.  It's a little tight under my arms.  I could use a little more length, but didn't want to pay more for the L-tall.  I'm 6'3"" 210lbs for reference.

There are 3 obnoxious scratchy tags on the inside of the shirt at the belt line, 2 of which are heavy duty and about 2"" long.  Why I ask?  These tags are not easy to remove. Stupid, but shirt is worth this inconvenience I guess.  Great for hot days in the south..",B0002MGM4O
"I like all things Columbia.  They are comfortable, fit will and dry quickly.",B0002MGM4O
"This shirt is perfect for cool Pennsylvania nights, and for going out to catch a quick bite.",B0002MGM4O
This is a good fitting shirt. Looks cool.,B0002MGM4O
Great fit and my husband likes the constant cool feeling of the shirt,B0002MGM4O
Thinner fabric fis true to size,B0002MGM4O
Lightweight.  Great for the heat of summer.,B0002MGM4O
I like these shirts I have bought two of them now.  But would recommend anyone go and try it on in a store.  As mine are a little big on the large size.  Amazon did have the best price on these though.,B0002MGM4O
"Fit is a little large so I have to wear a medium vs my typical large but they are great shirts, shed water and breathe.  Perfect for anything outdoors!",B0002MGM4O
"Very nice, my husband loved the color!",B0002MGM4O
"These Columbia shirts are very comfortable, light weight and cool. I really like the 2 pockets. I highly recommend. I have had 2 other shirts for over a year and they wear very very well.",B0002MGM4O
Great fit and comfortable shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"Very comfortable shirts, love the way they fit and feel. Great looking shirt with very vibrant colors, I especially love the fact that they have so many colors to chose from.",B0002MGM4O
It ooooooioooooiiioiThx and I love,B0002MGM4O
practical shirt for tropical setting and travel. easy to hand wash and dries quickly. a bit too many Columbia logos on it. could be more understated.,B0002MGM4O
beautiful shirt.  Too large.  Gave it away.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt. Comfortable,  cool, washes well and dries quickly",B0002MGM4O
"Overall, a good shirt although it seems to run a little big.",B0002MGM4O
"My husband loves this shirt. It's just his style, and fits very well!",B0002MGM4O
Only thing I don't like is the open back. Well put together.,B0002MGM4O
not good quality material now by several wash has poops,B0002MGM4O
Love these Columbia shirts. Great fit and cool in the hot summer.,B0002MGM4O
"As usual, very good quality and cheaper that local stores.",B0002MGM4O
Fits great. Seems to run bigger than normal. Bought my fianc a large (which is his size) and will get him a medium next time. great quality!,B0002MGM4O
"sizing was tricky, the medium was to big but not sure that the small is best fit either - normally wear a medium in most shirts.",B0002MGM4O
Very comfortable as well  as affordable.,B0002MGM4O
"Ordered a large tall. It's a little loose but that is what I was looking for.  No ironing required, stays nice and cool and dry.",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt, very breathable  - extremely lightweight with built in UV protection as well. WAY TOO BIG - I am 6'3 245 and the XL was MASSIVE. It is clearly made for someone with a significant potbelly and still be loose. I returned for a L and it is still large but fits nicely.",B0002MGM4O
Great product. my husband loves it.,B0002MGM4O
I ordered a size smaller because of reviews but they were too small. Reordered proper size and they are great and very comfortable,B0002MGM4O
"Display picture is accurate. Very well made and designed shirt. A little pricey but well worth it. Seems to be a little big for small, but I believe it's designed that way. There is a little history around the actual design of this shirt, that is why it's made this way. Fairly good selection of colors. Custom faded, just like bumblebee. Nice...",B0002MGM4O
Great For hot weather.!!! Runs large get a size smaller,B0002MGM4O
I order a size smaller than what I wanted. It worked well!,B0002MGM4O
"Just what I wanted, runs a bit large but very comfortable, well made and wicks dry quickly.",B0002MGM4O
Way to bug for a Medium size.... Not sure if I would be able to use it...,B0002MGM4O
"Love the shirt.  It is a roomy fit and my husband loves these shirts.  This particular style is a heavier weight rather than the really thin one.  My husband likes the thinner weight ones when it's really hot, and likes these for spring and fall and night time wear.  This color is more salmon ... red/orange ... and not a true red.  Love Columbia shirts!!!!",B0002MGM4O
"Very cool, but looks terrible on my small frame. Saving this for the 110+ days where I have to be out and about.",B0002MGM4O
I would recommend this shirt. Slightly water proof. Dries quickly. If you're doing hand washing in a motel room. Nice pockets.,B0002MGM4O
Glad I read the reviews concerning size. I bought a medium when I usually would by a large. The medium certainly feels like a large. Very happy.,B0002MGM4O
"I am a girl at 5' 5"" 135 pounds and typically wear a small in women's shirts. However, for these fishing shirts, I prefer the men's cuts, sizes, and colors better.
I ordered a men's XS and the shirt fits perfect! It is long enough to wear as a swim cover-up or with shorts. The sleeves aren't too long - although I typically roll them up anyway.",B0002MGM4O
I just love these shirts.  I will have one in every color.,B0002MGM4O
My husband absolutely loves these shirts. He wants all colors.,B0002MGM4O
Normally wear large shirts and I know these run big so I ordered a medium. Good to go.,B0002MGM4O
"love this short, it was bigger than the other one the same size, but in the heat that is fine",B0002MGM4O
"Truly cool shirt in the tropics, dries fast when it does get wet. Easy cleaning while away from home is. a big plus.",B0002MGM4O
Love these shirts! Columbia short sleeve PFG shirts are the best. Excellent and consistent fit.,B0002MGM4O
"Would be a nice shirt except for the logo - I don't know why Columbia insist on the logo, it makes this nice shirt look lame.

Going to try to take it off with a seam ripper.",B0002MGM4O
This is the third one of these I have bought and it is a great shirt.  I have been very pleased with the fit.,B0002MGM4O
"Good value. Good fit, though as with most Columbia, they tend to lean towards the large side, but this is useful if you use the pockets often, as the overall fit remains comfortable, not snug.",B0002MGM4O
Looks great and it really wicks sweat. My husband wore while moving my parents from hot TX to hit humid GA. When he was inside for short time it was dry.,B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirt, had to exchange the XL for a L because it was too roomy for my husband.  I should have read the previous reviews first.  But the return and re-purchase were easy to do.",B0002MGM4O
"These shirts run big, very roomy",B0002MGM4O
Spend countless hours on the water yet to find a better shirt,B0002MGM4O
"ALL THE OTHER DIFFERENT MEASURES, IS A DISASTER MANDARED CHILDREN'S CLOTHES, BE CAREFUL WHERE THE DIFFERENT COLORS AND SIZES ARE NOT THE THOSE WHO BUY",B0002MGM4O
Was a little too short for my liking.,B0002MGM4O
"Really comfortable. Bought a Large. I am 5'8"" 195.",B0002MGM4O
Very light weight but comfortable,B0002MGM4O
"I have several of these and they are great for the summer, as they are vented nylon, designed for activity, and if you catch them out of the dryer at the end of the cycle and hang them up, they are then ready to wear.  Highly recommended.",B0002MGM4O
I normally wear a large/xl and ordered a large.  A little roomie is OK and I think it fits my shoulders and the length is better  than the medium I tried on .  The first time I wore it it got splashed with red wine which came right out and did not stain-  the wine did not penetrate and came off the fabric with just a damp napkin.  Dries quickly,B0002MGM4O
Fit as expected. repels spills.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt for hot and humid days.  Fits well.  Wore it in August in Florida, kept me cool.",B0002MGM4O
I BOUGHT THE XL AND ITS LIKE A XXL,B0002MGM4O
They are at least two sizes bigger than what you would expect...but they are really nice shirts.,B0002MGM4O
"Really nice shirt. Fits great, looks nice on!!",B0002MGM4O
Great quality and pricing. Sizes run big so go down one.,B0002MGM4O
"I love shirt so much that I have it in 10 colors & patterns. It's the best shirt for everyday living. Breathable, cool, lightweight, UV & stain resistant.",B0002MGM4O
Fits great. Breathes very well. Fabric is very comfortable. Best Columbia shirt ever.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirts! Absolutely love them for fishing on the lake all day. They do not soak up water or sweat. Just make sure, as other reviewers have said, to order one size smaller than what you normally wear. I usually wear a large shirt but medium fits perfect.",B0002MGM4O
Came on time. Well fit.excellent shirts,B0002MGM4O
WAY LARGER than any other large sized shirt- fit like a dress,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt! Comfy and perfect fit!,B0002MGM4O
So my hubs hasn't even tried this shirt on but the color is not a nice light yellow like pictures it is a mustard yellow! So not sure if we will keep this but just wanted to let everybody know BEFORE they ordered.,B0002MGM4O
Hubby loved this shirt! Cool and comfortable.,B0002MGM4O
Any thing from Columbia is good !,B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt for the Israeli desert. Helped keep me cool. Also the oversized pockets held my iPhone 7 in the secured pockets. Definitely part of my travel wardrobe.,B0002MGM4O
"A little pricey, but a good quality shirt that breathes well. Great for hot/humid environments (I live in Florida!). I don't get as ""overheated"" as I do with thick cotton shirts. Great shirt for when you're outside - fishing, taking a long walk, or at an outside event.",B0002MGM4O
"Material feels almost like cotton.  Size runs very slightly large.  Order your regular size.  Very comfortable.  Have worn and washed several times, and appears to be sturdy.",B0002MGM4O
 Bought for Fathers Day gift. Nice blue color. Will make a great summer shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"Love these shirts. Comfortable, durable, and sharp.",B0002MGM4O
Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he loved it!,B0002MGM4O
Most of my shirts are Columbia. Very comfortable to wear and use it for my EDC.,B0002MGM4O
Can't go wrong with Columbia clothes they fit great and last much better than other sports wear,B0002MGM4O
"Excellent item, I  love the shirt.  Absolutely as promised and sizing is perfect.  Will be purchasing additional shirts.",B0002MGM4O
Love it! Fits perfect! Great show shirt. Keeps him cool when under pressure and the lights of the show ring,B0002MGM4O
"Runs a size too big. Quality material. Tamiami is the better hot weather summer shirt. Wrinkles pretty easy, maintenance required.",B0002MGM4O
"Good looking shirt, comfortable & fits as expected.",B0002MGM4O
This is the 3rd shirt (ordered different colors) I have gotten for hubby.  He loves them and they look great.  Very pleased.,B0002MGM4O
"Way too large, other brands I own the same size fits perfect, but this shirt looks like a garbage bag on me. Plus not much there to impress me for $40. It might be built ok but for a nylon shirt...$40? I can buy a whole nylon camping tent for $40. Which really, that's what this is... a tent! Now do I want to waste my energy for a return or exchange? I might just donate it to a fat man. It seems like the shirt was trimmed perfectly for the model in the picture but built for fat old rich guys with boats. From shoulder to shoulder width it was made for a guy my size but I need about 40 extra pounds of belly for the front and the back comes down past my tail bone for convenient sitting on it and choking myself. This shirt sucks! I should have gone to the store and tried it on but why can't a large shirt be a universal large? If I keep it, I could put a name tag on it and I would look like a back woods mechanic! ""Hello my name is Guss or Jethro or Buuuuud and I'm here to change your spark plugs!""",B0002MGM4O
This shirt is very light and comfortable. It is great for summer weather.,B0002MGM4O
"Great for casual wear.  Generous cut, comfortable fit.  Have worn to several various occasions.  Bought it two different colors to confuse the fish.",B0002MGM4O
My husband loves it so much! The color is beautiful and he says it's very comfortable also.,B0002MGM4O
My husband loves the way these Columbia shirts wear. I love the way they launder!,B0002MGM4O
Nice quality but the sizing chart is so far off that this medium shirt would easily fit a large and possibly a XL person.,B0002MGM4O
"not a good water wicker, shirt is okay",B0002MGM4O
being color blind its always a gamble when choosing colors. I received many complements both for the style and look of comfort in addition to the color...,B0002MGM4O
The color you see in the picture is NOT the real color,B0002MGM4O
"I now own 10 Columbia shirts, various colors, long and short sleeves.  Other reviewers will delight you with particulars as have I in the past.  Just think about it:  10 shirts.  Do I like this brand?",B0002MGM4O
Great quality and excellent product,B0002MGM4O
Per other reviews Im glad I ordered an XL rather than XXL as these run big. Fit is good and not too long. Very light weight and well made.,B0002MGM4O
Columbia makes very fine clothing. The Bahama II is just another example.,B0002MGM4O
Nice material. Very cool in the sun,B0002MGM4O
"This is a nice, lightweight and comfortable shirt. I wear it when fishing, but also wear it when hiking or camping or any outdoor activity. Looks great too!",B0002MGM4O
Color and size is not what I expected!,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt as pictured---true to color and size! My husband loves it! Will order more in other colors,B0002MGM4O
Great fit and the materials and quality is top notch. Love it,B0002MGM4O
"We purchased a total of 30+ shirts from Columbia to use them as uniform for our company. The quality of the fabric looked fine until we washed them a couple of times.

After a little over a month of use the shirts look horrible. The color faded really bad and they just look cheaply made.

This is the first time we received such bad product from Amazon.",B0002MGM4O
Living in the south these shirts are cool light material comfortable,B0002MGM4O
Ordered 2XL & it fit perfectly. I would not size down.,B0002MGM4O
"Nice material... soft, but unfortunately My husband had to change it from a Medium to a Small.  Medium fit too big.  Runs a bit bigger that a normal Medium  Send to change it for a Small.",B0002MGM4O
"very well made shirt, great for the outdoors",B0002MGM4O
"These are the best shirts for outdoor activities. I am a profesional birding guide in a tropical climate and anything else i wear gets me soaking wet for the entire day. With these shirts you dry very quickly as soon as you take a short break, They are very lightweight to wear and extremely comfortable. My wife assures me that washing and care is very simple also ( I wouldn.t know about that)  My only regret is that I did not discover them many years ago",B0002MGM4O
"I will never understand Columbia's obsession with making hiking/travel/activity shirts that don't look normal.  I don't love the puffy chest pockets, or the big Columbia tag.  That being said, their shirts are incredibly comfortable, sweat wicking, and breathable.  I just wished they looked more normal.",B0002MGM4O
a little larger than a normal large,B0002MGM4O
"My husband uses size M in all type of shirts. He haa bought locally buy before Columbia shirts in size M. I decided to buy online since it is cheapier, but I didn't fit. Shirt was too big, we had to sell it.",B0002MGM4O
I like these shirts. They keep you cool. But these stain so easy!!! When you are cleaning and gutting fish these shirts don't hold up well. Other fishing shirts have scotch guards for this very reason.,B0002MGM4O
The only problem I had the button holes are too small I had a hard time buttoning up and down other wise a great buy.,B0002MGM4O
great item i get what I expected  quality is very good love it my shirt,B0002MGM4O
"I love these shirts. They're perfect for hot summer days in the south. Keep in mind that they run large, so order a size smaller than normal.",B0002MGM4O
Excellent.  Fit and feel as expected!!!,B0002MGM4O
Best shirts and very comfortable,B0002MGM4O
Perfect.  Great for Thailand weather.,B0002MGM4O
nice shirt  well made  attractive,B0002MGM4O
Love it but it does fit a tad large on me.  I wear XL at 6 feet 210 lbs reasonably broad shouldered and it's very loose.  I like that but if you want a closer fit then go a size smaller.  I have not tried a large though so be warned.,B0002MGM4O
Great quality & my husband loves it!,B0002MGM4O
"The shirts and styles are fine, but the sizes don't match with the real size of the shirt. They are too large",B0002MGM4O
Bought for my son for work. Loves the material. Perfect for Florida's weather.,B0002MGM4O
excelent a little big large.... but is ok for me.....,B0002MGM4O
It is huge compared to other XL size columbia shirts...,B0002MGM4O
I suggest going down a size from what you normally wear in t shirts. It fits a bit baggier.,B0002MGM4O
Just as expected from Columbia.  Great product.  Bought several Columbia shirts and all were great.,B0002MGM4O
Purchased as a Christmas gift.  True to size.  Good quality and nice color.  I have always been satisfied with this brand.,B0002MGM4O
Lightweight material little bit on the big side,B0002MGM4O
Looks great on my husband! It is exactly what he wanted for Christmas. He wears them on his boat.,B0002MGM4O
"A good shirt, but definitely needs ironing.  Color is great.",B0002MGM4O
Great quality and price. Great color as advertised.,B0002MGM4O
"My husband and sons have worn the 100% cotton...the boys didn't care for them...neither did I like ironing them.
This year I gave my husband 3 of the nylon mix fabric.  He loves them!  The boys are getting the lg. sleeve for birthdays!
They will like them!",B0002MGM4O
Great gift for my brother the fisherman.  He is a fairly masculine guy but loved this pale purple color.  It looks great on him.,B0002MGM4O
"excellent quality, but the sizes are bigger",B0002MGM4O
The shirt is very nice but the large looks more like an extra large.,B0002MGM4O
"Great deep maroon color and these shirts are so light and cool, great for a Florida native.",B0002MGM4O
"i ordered this shirt when i was a ""prep"" in high school lol.
i'm a 110lb 5'11"" girl and i ordered a men's small so that it would fit me big so i could wear it with my leggings and chacos & it was perfect!
i wouldn't wear it now since my style has changed, but the quality of this shirt is awesome & you definitely get your money's worth.",B0002MGM4O
Perfect gift for my Dad.  He loves it and looks great in it!,B0002MGM4O
"I have cotton Columbia that need less ironing!
Fit - good, length - perfect.",B0002MGM4O
Wonderful!  Wonderful!  Wonderful!!!!,B0002MGM4O
"Nice looking, lightweight shirt.  Would be nice to have cotton version for better breathebility.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirts. I especially like the new green color.,B0002MGM4O
"I read many of the reviews before, I purchased this shirt.
They were all helpful. Especially, the one's regarding that mentioned that the shirts run large.
I am a big guy, 275 lbs.
I ordered the Extra Large and it fits just fine.
Very comfortable.
I am very pleased.",B0002MGM4O
"Perfect shirt for hot, summer days because they have hidden vents.  These shirts are perfect for fishing or casual attire. Tip: Do not use fabric softener when washing and remove promptly from dryer to prevent wrinkling.",B0002MGM4O
"I need to find more, in not so ""Safety Green"". It started a little brighter than I'd like, but faded well.",B0002MGM4O
"As long as you bear in mind this is a loose fitting shirt it is excellent. Love them. Water beads off, allows the body to breath, great for any outdoor fun or job!",B0002MGM4O
"love the color ,perfect size my husband love it",B0002MGM4O
"I bought this for my dad for Christmas knowing he would wear it often. He loves what he calls ""airy shirts""...or shirts made from material other than 100% cotton that help to wick moisture and keep him cool. He spends a lot of time outside in the Texas heat, so this type of shirt is perfect for both working outside in the yard or in his shop. As I have purchased several shirts like this for him before, I know he will get a lot of use out of it. My only wish is that Columbia sold these at a lower price. Still, this makes a worthy Christmas/birthday gift.",B0002MGM4O
"Love this shirt! Cool, lots of pockets with a loose fit makes this a comfy shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"Love this shirt, very good quality.",B0002MGM4O
My husband really liked it. The color was great and it fit nicely!,B0002MGM4O
"One of my favorite brands of shirts, usually my go to for lots of stuff.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt! Beautiful color. Very lightweight and great material. My husband wears it often.,B0002MGM4O
This shirt is super comfy and cool in the heat.  The cut of this shirt is made for a short barrel chested body though.  I had to go bigger than I wanted just to get the length I needed.,B0002MGM4O
"These are my favorite hot-weather, all-cotton shirts ... great quality and will last for many seasons ... love the flow-through ventilation on my back ...",B0002MGM4O
My husband wears this when it's hot outside but he wants to wear something a bit nicer than a t-shirt. Fits as expected and looks nice tucked or untucked.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt.  Very comfortable.  Perfect for travel.,B0002MGM4O
Nice product but not as nice as the comparable LL Bean. Sized a little smaller too.,B0002MGM4O
"Please of you are buying this super big shirt go for a size down, my father use to buy large, but this one had to be Medium.",B0002MGM4O
"I like the way it looks and it fits a little small, but that really could be that I'm a little bit larger.",B0002MGM4O
"I really love how these shirts fit and feel.  I purchased several and wore them throughout my recent trip to Ecuador.  I can get away with short sleeves and over the course of 3 1/2 weeks was never bitten by a single mosquito, despite being all over the country including the upper Amazon.",B0002MGM4O
These shirts have a perfect material for daily wear.  I've got several of the other models of shirts in the Columbia line and this fabric is the only one I feel very comfortable with even without a tee shirt.  Ended up buying 7 of them in long and short sleeve.,B0002MGM4O
Tried on at academy to check my size. Saved some money buying on Amazon. Fit as expected.,B0002MGM4O
"Attractive shirt with very useful pockets. Thicker material than I expected, but holds well on travel.",B0002MGM4O
Nice product.  Brought for trip to Cabo MX.  great for dress and casual wear,B0002MGM4O
"One of the best fishing shirts out there. This shirt washes and dries amazingly well - no wrinkles, no shrinkage, and no change in color. I would definitely purchase again if needed.",B0002MGM4O
Good fitting and good looking wash and wear light weight shirt. Highly recommend especially for warm days on sale price I received.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt even for the hot weather in Arizona.  Fits well and and is quite light weight.,B0002MGM4O
Best cool breathable shirts on the market. Highly recommended,B0002MGM4O
Wonderful shirt. I have four of these. Feel great wearing them. I particularly like the pockets which are large enough to put an iPhone 6 in them and seal with velcro. Fine workmanship.,B0002MGM4O
Great to wear. Fits great. Washes up great,B0002MGM4O
"Just on time, perfect fit, shirt it is great...good seller!!!",B0002MGM4O
"Bought this for my husband, fits great and looks great !",B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirt, as expected by Columbia and their products",B0002MGM4O
Great color!  Perfect fit on my husband and kept him much cooler than a t-shirt!,B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt.  Cool and great for hot Texas summers.,B0002MGM4O
"I chose L instead of XL, and it fits.",B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt but material is very thin.,B0002MGM4O
"Got the XL regular for my 6'5"" skinny husband. It was both too short and too wide.",B0002MGM4O
I can wad this up and jam it into the bottom of a back pack and leave it for days and when I take it out to put it on it is fresh and wrinkle free. That's exactly what I was hoping for when I bought it and it is exactly what it delivers.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirts. Hold up well and keep you cooler than anything else I've tried. I live in Florida and when fishing during the summer months, these are my go to shirts. Only issues are they run too large and are extremely prone to wrinkles. They're pricey, so I tend to wait for sales.",B0002MGM4O
This shirt is sized well and fit perfectly. It dries fast when wet and feels cool in the hot Florida sun.,B0002MGM4O
"I was unsure if my husband would like this shirt when I purchased it.  He loves it and I love the color!  Easy to launder, lightweight, and looks good for all occasions.",B0002MGM4O
Different color and texture of other travel shirts. Easy care washes and dryes fast,B0002MGM4O
I love my old - >20 year old shirts - from Columbia.  This one is closest to the old one in design and comfort.,B0002MGM4O
"Very comfortable, good weight.  I got this primarily for a little extra sun protection while doing yard work.  It's light weight and breathable.",B0002MGM4O
The shirt it great but it ran a size large.,B0002MGM4O
Met my expectation. Would buy another if offered in similar subdued color,B0002MGM4O
"My sixth Columbia shirt of this style and far and away my favorite shirt.  Fit is loose, but I like shirts to fit loose.  Quality is exceptional.",B0002MGM4O
These fit big so go a size down. However these are great for summer time as they are a little dressy yet breathable.,B0002MGM4O
"I ordered the same size that I normally order from other manufacturers, but this shirt seemed a lot tighter/smaller. Otherwise I like the shirt.",B0002MGM4O
Fits great and is vented so its nice and cool to wear.,B0002MGM4O
"Chip fabric and quality
I will not recommended
The treads co.e off after the second use",B0002MGM4O
"uncomfortable in the neck area, the fabric is abraisive and causes chafing, sorry this is a do not buy.
updated review,
The shirt has been worn less than 5 times and the stitching that holds the collar on has begun to unravel.
Of course it's too late to return the shirt so I'm stuck with an inferior product.",B0002MGM4O
Great quality. Buy one size smaller than normal.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt, have five now!  Go to summer shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"my fiance loves his new shirt.  great color, fit & performance.  lightweight & very breathable.",B0002MGM4O
"The color is too bright for me.  It's a nice pleasing color, but it doesn't look good on me.",B0002MGM4O
"Great looking shirt fits just like all Columbia Fishing shirts fit me, a little large. Love the color",B0002MGM4O
"It fit my husband quite nicely. This is a very casual shirt that is good for date night, going to the movies or shopping.

We live in Florida so he appreciate the lightness of the fabric, it keeps him cool.

Very easy to wash and dry and wear, no ironing needed. Personally, I think he looks quite handsome in this shirt.

I will buy from this Amazon seller again, very courteous and polite people to deal with.",B0002MGM4O
My husband Love ms these shirts. Comfy.  Nice colors.  Easy to wear.  No wrinkling issues,B0002MGM4O
Beautiful color and perfect fit. Doesn't wrinkle as easy as the ones with cotton. Just throw in the dryer with a damp rag.,B0002MGM4O
Very comfortable and lightweight. Perfect for summer.,B0002MGM4O
The fabric is thin.  I have to steam press this shirt for it to look nice.,B0002MGM4O

This was exactly as we have come to live about this brand. Consistently excellent!,B0002MGM4O
"Usually I wear size large, but this shirt run too big",B0002MGM4O

"Really nice Shirt for just about anything.  Going out, Camping, Traveling or just anything. Nice quality, cleans up well. Spots wipe off.",B0002MGM4O
"Nothing wrong with the shirt...I ordered the wrong style.

Large size was huge! I wear an xl and it was big on me!,B0002MGM4O
"Beautiful colors and shirts, fir well, excellent quality and my boys loved them!",B0002MGM4O
"Cool, thin, soft, moisture wicking, and safe in the sun. Wear great!",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt... Just a tad boxy but other than that could not ask for a better feeling shirt,B0002MGM4O
"These are my favorite shirts.  I never wear shirts tucked in, and these are made to wear that way.  I usually wear XL (6'2"", 240), but in these I always get a large, and they fit great. I like everything about these shirts.  Might even wear them fishing someday.",B0002MGM4O
"Looks , feels and fits excellent! It was a gift for my husband, and he said he loves it! Such a nice color also! Arrived on the exact date as I was told also!",B0002MGM4O
I live in Florida. It's hot in the summer! These shirts keep you cool! They are light so they move in a breeze to move the air under them like a fan. They are spf 30 for protection. It's all I ware in the hot weather ! Have six. This was a replacement !,B0002MGM4O
Excellent....everything was fine,B0002MGM4O
"Very comfortable shirt, I have several of them, however, the picture portrays a pale yellow, which is what I wanted, but the actual color is more of a bright tangerine shade.",B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt. Glad I went one size smaller after reading the reviews.,B0002MGM4O
Material a little different. took some getting used to.,B0002MGM4O
"This was a gift for my son-in-law, but the ones like this I have bought for my husband are great. Good quality and style.",B0002MGM4O
I was pleasantly surprised by this dress!! It is super cute and fits great. Runs true to size. Was perfect for beach pictures. Highly recommend!!,B0002MGM4O
I love this fabric and the styling. The color could use a little more intensity.,B0002MGM4O
"To whom can I claim, the quality and material used in the fabrics of this shirts I bought were VERY VERY DEFICIENT. How can I get in contact with the Producing Company??",B0002MGM4O
"Outstanding Columbia Shirt! Great fit, breathability with all the quality features I expect from Columbia. It launders well out of the dryer.",B0002MGM4O
These shirts show many wrinkles after washing and drying,B0002MGM4O
great and nicer than the one in store. arrived on time and washes very  easy.,B0002MGM4O
Typical advanced features and quality you expect from Columbia.,B0002MGM4O
"Shirt looked great when it arrived.
I normally wear a Large shirt.

I should've read the other reviews before I ordered a Large in this one.
Definitely fits larger than normal ""Large"" shirts.
So much so that I had to return.

3 stars, but only due to the inconvenience of over-sizing and returning.",B0002MGM4O
These shirts terrific as well as stylish.. They apparently are made well & sizing is full. Personally I'm generally a large but the 4 s***s I've purchased were mediums (due to reading your reviews).  Absolutely fit perfect.. Recommend 1 size smaller.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt perfect for any hot and humid climate. The fabric is extremely light and comfortable and easy to keep clean.  Perfect travel shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"Love the color and the style as always! This makes my 5th shirt, will eventually have all the colors.. The MOST comfortable shirt on the market!",B0002MGM4O
pilled after one wash; not satisfactory,B0002MGM4O
"As previous reviews stated, the shirts do run a little big, recommend ordering a size smaller is you like a tighter fit.",B0002MGM4O
Nice fit and well made. Perfect for the hot weather.,B0002MGM4O
Purchased for my grandson and he was very pleased,B0002MGM4O
Got a lot of compliments over this shirt,B0002MGM4O
"For summertime FL heat, these shirts are a must! Excellent venting, and they don't pick up any moisture at all if you sweat a lot.....like I do.",B0002MGM4O
"Love Columbia clothing because they are nice quality, but, they do run large. The shirts are too big for my husband and now I have to send them back. Bummer.",B0002MGM4O
"I wanted a fishing shirt to wear on hot summer days. Unfortunately, this one did not make the cut. The Columbia Blood and Guts III is a much nicer shirt. This one wouldn't be terrible, but there are better options. The material is light enough, so it would be fine to keep you cool.",B0002MGM4O
Exceptional quality as you would expect from the Columbia brand. Fit very well and wear great. Excellent cooling and comfort.,B0002MGM4O
This shirt is what I expected it would be.,B0002MGM4O
"Arrived on time and fit as expected, my son really likes the shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"Wear them all the time, great for everyday.",B0002MGM4O
"huge! Size M feels like XXXXXL.
Ridiculous.",B0002MGM4O
Remember to buy one size under a normal shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"These shirts are awesome! Very cool and comfortable, dries fast when it gets wet, durable and does not wrinkle. My wife hates them because this is all I wear in the summertime. Ordered different colors to try to save my marriage.",B0002MGM4O
This lavender is just perfect!  Not too purple - not too light!  Short sleeves is great for the hot weather and it fits perfectly! Highly recommend,B0002MGM4O
"Solid company, well made and performs",B0002MGM4O
They run large but my husband loves these shirts!,B0002MGM4O
Perfect for my dad's 81st bday!,B0002MGM4O
Good product at a great price!!!,B0002MGM4O
"Nice light weight, not to be worn new campfires or lite cigarettes, any spark will melt a hole",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. Fit my dad perfect.,B0002MGM4O
This shirt is no where NEAR true to size. My husband usually wears a large and this swallowed him in length and width. we gave it to my father in law who usually wears a 2X,B0002MGM4O
"Always order less than one of your size; Eg., I use XXL. The XL fit me perfectly",B0002MGM4O
"Love the color. It is the most wrinkled shirt I own even when I dry it on the hanger. I HATE ironing but in order to be presentable, it has to be ironed.",B0002MGM4O
the color was as expected - no too pink.,B0002MGM4O
"I liked the color and style of this shirt, but after the 1st washing it began to pill badly.",B0002MGM4O
This is the fifth Columbia short sleeve shirt I have purchased for my husband! He loves them because of the feel and the back vent which helps to keep him cool on hot days. I love them because they are great looking. They wash beautifully and dry quickly!,B0002MGM4O
"The description says red, but it was more of a light pink when it arrived.  Be careful, the online picture is much darker than what will come in the mail.",B0002MGM4O
Husband loves it. He's been wanting one and glad I found a good deal on here as compared to stores. Fits perfect and he finds it very comfortable.,B0002MGM4O
This is the first Columbia Bahama shirt my husband has ever had.  He really likes it and it fits well.  Very well made shirt.,B0002MGM4O
great looking shirt and fine quality!! 5 STARS!!!,B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirt but Medium is way large. I will buy a small and give the medium to a larger man. Otherwise, beautiful color and product :-)",B0002MGM4O
"I have a couple of these shirts and really like them. The fit is on the roomy side which I like, but I would say they run almost a size larger than marked.

 It is a medium weight cotton shirt. It isn't as light and breathable as a Tamiami, but it is still  a great option for a summer day, and even earlier and later in the season.

 When I wash it I normally just put it on a hanger to dry and have never felt a need to iron it at all.",B0002MGM4O
Light and airy and very nice looking.,B0002MGM4O
I own several shirts like this -- good summertime wear.  Keeps you cool with the back vent and dries quickly if you get caught in the rain.,B0002MGM4O
"Great fit, great price, I've begun using Amazon as my Columbia replacement center.",B0002MGM4O
will order again in different color,B0002MGM4O
"Awesome shirt, it is quickly becoming my favorite.  Wrinkle resistant, UV resistant, water resistant (It is not water proof!) beads of water tend to run off of it.  It is light and breathable.",B0002MGM4O
Okay but tamiami looks and feels better overall,B0002MGM4O
"I purchased three Columbia shirts of L size
Thompson was OK
Bahama was at least two sizes bigger",B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirt, both the fit and feel. It seems so many shirts are trending to be on the small side.  This has a nice full fit.",B0002MGM4O
Excellent shirt by one size smaller than you normally wear.,B0002MGM4O
really nice shirt light weight very good color,B0002MGM4O
"These shirts are PFG (fishermen) are more loose. I am Large normally, but this model is better to use Medium.",B0002MGM4O
"Nice Shirts! Light, comfortable, much better quality than most expensive shirts in big box retailers! Great in Florida heat and humidity too!",B0002MGM4O
Great value!! These are for work. I carry my phone in the pocket to protect it from...me. No more screen replacments.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt for a great price.  Fits well and is beautiful.  It keeps you cool in the heat of the summer.,B0002MGM4O
Great buy ......just what I wanted,B0002MGM4O
"I know I'm in the minority here and thought I happened into a good thing - NOT. If you perspire at all, wearing this shirt is literally the same as wearing a plastic bag. After working outside and sweating profusely, no perspiration at all showed on the outside of the shirt and it was totally dry - while moisture was literally running down the inside of it!! I so wanted it to work that I washed it twice hoping the problem was with the sun protection treatment, but no improvement. I bought two of them and am returning both. Also planning on calling Colombia, the maker, to notify them of this issue since (in my opinion) the lack of wicking and evaporative cooling in a product sold as a cool shirt for hot weather activity could be dangerous.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. Had to buy another one.,B0002MGM4O
"It was so big, nice color but too big",B0002MGM4O
Was a HUGE hit for my boyfriends Birthday. He is a fisherman and this shirt blew him away! Thanks so much! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!,B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirt, very light for very hot weather.",B0002MGM4O
"This Columbia shirts are too large than expected, too different from other Columbia shirts I have bought",B0002MGM4O
"A nice Quality shirt at a reasonable price
My husband is an avid fisherman and he loves it",B0002MGM4O
"I love this shirt.  My husband already had a bright blue, so I wasn't sure if I should get this one. But, because he has almost every color, I went ahead and am glad I did.  We love the color!",B0002MGM4O
"This is a great color, especially for Spring and Summer.  My husband didn't know if he would like yellow, but this yellow is really nice, and once he wore the shirt, he realized it is a great color.  My teenage girls love it, and they always have to approve of Dad's wardrobe!",B0002MGM4O
"As noted in reviews, the fit is large, so I ordered down one size, which was fine. Nice color (Commando), light weight.",B0002MGM4O
My boyfriend loves this shirt! It keeps him cool!,B0002MGM4O
"Great looking shirt, good fit, and easy to laundry.",B0002MGM4O
"I bought this shirt for my outdoor loving dad for Father's Day.

Pros:
> fits well
> blocks sun which is important for him
> the back has a flap with mesh so my dad doesn't overheat which happens when you're out fishing all day in the sun
> great color selection
> great and dependable brand
> material is comfortable against the skin and doesn't get all wet and sweaty ( breathes )

Cons:
> I don't like tags in shirts and it would be better if it was tagless.",B0002MGM4O
excellent product for the price,B0002MGM4O
"I bought these for my husband and he finds them perfect!  Wash, a few minutes in the dryer and you're done!",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt very well made fits perfect.,B0002MGM4O
"Had hoped for a fabric that would ""breathe"".  The ventilaiton flaps help, but the sweat from body is not wicked away, you are drenched in sweat.  On a sunny, warm day this protects you from the sun, but does not give enough ventilation.",B0002MGM4O
"I am 5'-9"" and I am 215 lbs. I am super muscular, I had to switch from a small to the XS because the smalls were too baggy. the XS fits well the chest is perfect for me to move around and it is loose in the waist.

Expect these to be extremely large compared to other close in your size.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt.  My wife even asked me to buy more.  Can't begin to describe the comfort and the breeze it allows to travel through the shirt.  So comfortable.,B0002MGM4O
"I love all my PFGs! It's a great summer shirt for whatever your summer brings. Great for working, boating, hiking, grilling out, whatever! Order at least 1 size smaller than you normally wear, because these shirts fit large. Great shirt at a great price!",B0002MGM4O
Son wears a large. It was just too big. Had to size down one size to get a better fit.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt  looks fantastic if i say so myself,B0002MGM4O
"DO NOT BUY unless you plan on having a bubble around you that keeps you from physically coming into contact with anything that may touch the shirt.  I have only worn this shirt 4 times and it is fuzzing!  Did not show up till I wore it the fourth time 4 days after my return window closed.  The other shirts are fine that I purchased from Columbia via Amazone.  They are polyester.  Do Not Buy The Nylon!  Why Columbia Sports Wear charges a premium yet uses inferior material is beyond me.  If it was a discounted line I could see it, but normal store retail price is $40 plus dollars.  The shirt did fit well and was comfortable to wear.  Still doesn't make the lack of durability of the shirt excusable.  I feel like I wasted my money.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt in every way.  I now have 3 of them,B0002MGM4O
I like it the only complaint is that the shirt gets wrinkled way too easy.,B0002MGM4O
"All fine, i received this product without problem",B0002MGM4O
Love the color not as bright as most shirts of this type. Keeps me cool when I work in the sun and would give 5 stars if it didn't wrinkled a little (but not too bad).,B0002MGM4O
Like these shirts as they fit quite well.  Large enough to stay tucked in.,B0002MGM4O
Not as nice as the ColumbiaTamamia II. Fabric is a little rougher and not as dressie.,B0002MGM4O
Attractive and easy care. Wonderful color and fabric.,B0002MGM4O
I'm a woman and wanted this as a beach cover up. A small is great!,B0002MGM4O
"Excellent quality.  I bought a medium but the size is is larger than I intended.  Also baggier than I really like.  However, its good appearance is as pictured and the size problem was not so severe it merited a return.  I would certainly buy another but not until I could test sizes ""live.""",B0002MGM4O
"As with all clothing that is UPC rated it is hard to decide if it actually does work as advertised.  However, I did not use sun screen on my shoulders and I saw no sun damage or redness on my shoulders after a long day at Disney World with the kids so I can only conclude that it does the job.  Material is light and airy and the fit is comfortable.  Only caveat is that it is boxy and runs big in the body but that has already been noted by many reviewers.",B0002MGM4O
My son's in- law loves this shirt.,B0002MGM4O
My husband loves the Bahama shirts by Columbia.  He is a project manager building multi family in the Texas heat and comes home to praise how cool his shirt felt all day.  The UpF 30 helps too :),B0002MGM4O
Buy one size down from your usual size.  This shirt looks great and is appropriate for wearing anywhere.  Love the construction and material.  Wore to brunch yesterday and received several compliments on my shirt!,B0002MGM4O
"Comfortable, lightweight, durable.",B0002MGM4O
The shirt is well made and perfect for fishing.,B0002MGM4O
"I love this style shirt, and these like the others I've had run a little large.  I typically wear a large shirt, but with these a medium fits perfectly.",B0002MGM4O
I bought this as a gift for my husband. It was a huge success!,B0002MGM4O
These shirts are the best of the best!!,B0002MGM4O
Love the fit and feel of the product.  Going to be great for vacation attire.,B0002MGM4O
"The sleeves were a bit long, but overall a good well fitted shirt. I can't wait to buy more colors of the shirt.",B0002MGM4O
Probably my favorite color of my favorite shirt. I like how quickly it dries after a drenching,B0002MGM4O
"Pockets way to large, hard to control closure. fit is large by at least 1 size maybe 2, good for very loos fit",B0002MGM4O
"I wear women's medium, unfortunately the color that I need (Sage) is not available in the women's shirts so I decided to take a risk and order a men's shirt. I a size XS and it fit perfectly, just like the women's M, the only difference is the orientation of the buttons and the sleeve length is maybe an inch longer than the women's.",B0002MGM4O
"The quality of this shirt is great, and while a bit larger than expected, that wasn't my problem.
My problem is that the ""sunset red"" shirt is not red, or sunset.  It's fluorescent salmon or orange.  Much lighter than depicted, and much more pink.  My son looked at it for a second horrified before I told him I'd return it.",B0002MGM4O
Love got for my husband . Hold up good still looks new and he wears it a lot.,B0002MGM4O
Didn't fit like it should have to large,B0002MGM4O
Looks great - nice and cool.  Great for the boat.,B0002MGM4O
Excellent product.  Vibrant colors as presented.  Quality materials. Have received many compliments.,B0002MGM4O
"looking forward to wearing again this summer.cool looking, cool wearing",B0002MGM4O
Good fishing shirt for husband. He likes the short sleeves. I'm more of a fan of the long sleeves. The color is a bit bright for my tastes but it is not my shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"Solid shirts, had them embroidered and they look great.",B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirt but too large. I ordered a medium.  I always wear a medium . That medium shirt is 22 inches across the shoulders, 50 inches around at the arm pit, and 50 inches around the waist. Convince me that is a medium shirt.",B0002MGM4O
Fits as expected (loose relaxed fit). Good quality materials.,B0002MGM4O
I bought this as a present and he loved it! I'm really glad I took the time to read the reviews because they do run big and getting a size smaller worked out perfectly!,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. It does run a little large.,B0002MGM4O
Very nice shirts especially when it comes to Casual Wear on the boat or for fishing. Very comfortable and easy to maintain.,B0002MGM4O
Buy these and embroider them for customers that want an upscale work shirt ... they are great!!,B0002MGM4O
"great shirt, but order a size smaller then your ususal.",B0002MGM4O
I gave it 4 stars because the white button should be black. Fit perfect for normal extra large,B0002MGM4O
It's lightweight and cool (he likes) and still looks nice (I like).,B0002MGM4O
Very comfortable. Tad on the large side,B0002MGM4O
"Purchased for my husband at Christmas. Fits perfect and I mean perfect. It's great for any occasion casual or dressy. These are very nice shirts and can be very expensive but these are worth every dime great fit, great price.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt with room to move my arms when lifting above my head.,B0002MGM4O
i expected to be alittle larger then 2xl and it is. love this shirt,B0002MGM4O
"Comfortable, fits great.  Can be used casual or more formal.  Stitching is starting to unravel after a few washes, still holding up though.",B0002MGM4O
"i love these shirts... wear them all the time. comfortable, nice cut, great pockets, make me look much more attractive than i actually am",B0002MGM4O
too long just like the other one but medium is too tight,B0002MGM4O
He lived it!  Very comfortable and light.,B0002MGM4O
Material is nice and my hard to please husband likes the lighter weight for our hot humid summers!,B0002MGM4O
"I love it, good price and fit. I plan on buying more.",B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirts.  Got to love em.  In S. FL, this fabric is wonderful.  Almost wrinkle free if handled properly after the wash.",B0002MGM4O
"The shirts made in Vietnam are running larger ,",B0002MGM4O
Very nice shirt its great here in the desert.,B0002MGM4O
I really love my Columbia shirts!,B0002MGM4O
"My husbands favorite shirt, I've bought many of these over the years.",B0002MGM4O
"I'm normally a 3x size but after reading reviews I went with a 2x and it fits perfect. So believe the reviewers, this product runs large. This is a quality product all the way and I am glad I didn't go cheap. Vented throughout and double stitched. I accidentally left a black marker open in my pocket and the stain came right out.",B0002MGM4O
Perfect shirt for outdoor activity or going out to dinner.,B0002MGM4O
Fast shipment. No problems. My son loves it,B0002MGM4O
I bought it because I loves the color and design of the short.  Very comfortable ....,B0002MGM4O
"These shirts are great.  Nice and light weight.  Great UV protection.  The sizes do run big but in reading the other reviews I anticipated this so they fit as I had hoped/expected.  I wear a XXL and ordered a XXL.  These are likely a size larger so there is plenty of room for me to move around comfortably. In other words they are not snug.  If you want it to fit without a lot of room, order a size smaller at least.",B0002MGM4O
Pockets fray around the velcro fasteners.,B0002MGM4O
Medium size was a perfect fit; wear large t-shirts normally.,B0002MGM4O
"I purchased this shirt for my husband. It arrived quickly and was exactly what was described. Beautiful color shirt. These shirts tend to fit a little loose in our experience. My husband wears a large t-shirt and wears a medium in these shirts. The Columbia polo style he wears a large. These shirts are great wash and wear shirts. They are very low maintenance but look great! He always wears these fishing, outdoors and takes them on cruises with us. They are very comfortable and cool. The really seem to hold up well.",B0002MGM4O
Way too large!  Nice shirt but order two sizes smaller.,B0002MGM4O
My boyfriend loved the color!!!,B0002MGM4O
"I recommend ordering down a size, my husband is normally an XL but he is a L in these shirts.",B0002MGM4O
"Nice fit, cool airflow helps in warm, humid environments.  Would recommend.",B0002MGM4O
"A little big on him, but he didn't want to return it or exchange it so I guess it's a winner.  The color is very handsome on any guy (right ladies?!).  The fabric is, I am told, extremely comfortable and breathable.  It has some wrinkle-resistance which makes it a really great shirt to pack for travel, or even wear it on a drive and still look neat and nice when you finally get out of the car.  He took it on a trip to Italy and judging by the photos, he wore it almost every day!  We will be getting more of these in lots of colors, we just might look at going down a size for the next batch.  These are really great shirts.",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirts, but they do run large.  Went down a size in Men's and Women's.",B0002MGM4O
"I also must thank everyone who said to buy a size down, this shirt was a gift and I was really afraid it would not fit. I bought a size S. He is skinny and tall (180, 6'1) and it fit perfectly.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirts and fit as expected.,B0002MGM4O
Bought this for my dad and father-in-law. It's both their favorite shirt. We embroidered my dad's company logo on his so he can wear it to business meetings comfortably in this hot Texas heat.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt. However, it arrived very badly folded and completely wrinkled. Obviously, a shirt that someone have returned. Really disappointed.",B0002MGM4O
Looks awesome. The black fabric is a very dark black even after multiple wash cycles. As always Columbia shirts seem to run a bit big. I wear a large T shirt and I wear a medium Columbia shirt comfortably.,B0002MGM4O
Comfortable and fits nice. I get lots of complements and inquiries about the shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"As expected, good quality and fit",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. I got this for my boyfriend's dad and he loved it!,B0002MGM4O
Bought several of these for the hubby. True to size and color. Great quality shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"I love the fabric, so nice for the cool weather!!",B0002MGM4O
Husband likes the fit and color,B0002MGM4O
"I got this for my boyfriend and he wears it all the time in summer/spring. It's lightweight, comfortable and it can be dressed up or down.",B0002MGM4O
"Great material, had to return because it was way too big. Good seller, no problems.",B0002MGM4O
Nice looking shirt for work or play.,B0002MGM4O
These shirts fit as expected and my husband loves them!,B0002MGM4O
Size runs almost one whole size larger than normal.,B0002MGM4O
"My husband loves these shirts! He is however 6 ft 7inches tall so he needs the tall version, unfortunately they only come in light blue and white, not really the best choices for actual fishing, since its not the cleanest sport, but nice for feeling dressed well and comfortable in Texas heat.",B0002MGM4O
Love it...live in them in the summer....,B0002MGM4O
Great deal on this shirt! I love it for working around the house and for fishing! These shirts can be upwards of $50 at Academy but was very affordable here. Obviously it's the same quality product (Columbia) as you would get there for a fraction of the price. Would definitely buy more in the future!,B0002MGM4O
"Wrinkles after wash and dry, followed wash and dry directions.",B0002MGM4O
I have a few other Columbia sport shirts.  This one is significantly larger than the others.,B0002MGM4O
It is a nice shirt that washes well.  I still run an iron on it.  The price was reasonable.,B0002MGM4O
"No complaints, fit great and wears very well. I will be ordering more in different colors.",B0002MGM4O
Great fit. This shirt fits better than others I have bought. I am a big guy that has broad shoulders and I often have trouble with fit across my chest.  No issues with this shirt.,B0002MGM4O
I recived this produc very fine and on time,B0002MGM4O
Even though its a bit large on him.  I still love the material and it looks good on him.,B0002MGM4O
"I am large in almost all shirts, but on these Columbia shirts which I have like 7 or 8 my best fit is small. I like fit but tie, medium fits me fairly ok but too long for me I am 5.10"" tall and 175L  t which mean I am not a short nor a fat or belly gay I will call myself regular. So my recommendation is: if you like it fited buy tow sixes down if not buy one size down.",B0002MGM4O
Great style from Columbia and very comfortable for humid climates with its airflow design as well as the uv protection .,B0002MGM4O
"Good quality, product as advertised right size",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. Sadly it ripped in the wash.,B0002MGM4O
"I liked this colombia shirt, Amazon has the best price",B0002MGM4O
Good color (marine blue) and very comfortable to wear even in warm environments.,B0002MGM4O
Ordered this for my friend. I love the color! Fits him perfectly and it arrived fairly quickly.,B0002MGM4O
"I've bought these shirts  before so I was aware of what size to buy.  YOU MUST BUY 1 SIZE SMALLER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR, and it will fit you perfectly-----------TRUST ME. Nice selection of colors.  Nice and cool in the hot summertime",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirts for fishing or any other summer activity. I own five of them now and they are pretty much all I wear outside of work during short sleeve weather. I was apprehensive when I first bought them because previously I wore nothing but cotton, but these are just as soft and dry out much quicker than cotton. My nephew and I were out on the boat and both got soaked running across some chop, we stopped in a bay to dry out in the sun and my shirt (at twice the size of his) dried in about 10-15 minutes; his cotton t-shirt was still wet when were loading the boat on the trailer at the end of the day.",B0002MGM4O
Its looks great but this color goes a little short,B0002MGM4O
"Shirt runs large, Im 6'0 and 215lbs and use Medium size. Very confortable but not as fresh as I thought for air flow on hot places.",B0002MGM4O
"Bought this shirt for extended travel in the Med especially Greece.  Needed something durable, easy to wear in humid climate especially around the beach.  Also easy to wash and dry quickly.  This shirt was outstanding great set of pockets to make it easy for all the things we carry today.  Would dry after washing in an hour in the sun.  Wicked off the sweat avoiding the smell from shirts that did not.  Well worth the money.",B0002MGM4O

"I'm a big fan of Columbia ""breather-back"" shirts. In the hot Texas summers these things are no joke- they really do keep you cool. For no good reason, I only had one of these for many years and I only used it for fishing. This past summer I snapped out of that nonsense and started buying more and wearing them all over. Here's my take on the different shirts, hope this helps you. (for reference I am 5'8"", 175#, 32"" waist and usually wear either an athletic-cut large shirt or a medium if it's cut normally...yes, I live in size hell)

Bonehead: This shirt is 100% cotton and is very tough. Makes a great work shirt. It wrinkles easily and has the traditional PFG assortment of pockets on the front. It is the quintessential PFG shirt. It does not fly under the radar but it looks fine for what it is. I have several of these and if you can get them less than $15 that's a great deal. Given the pros of the other shirts, however, I must say this style is my least favorite (but still a great shirt, and my go-to work shirt). I always get a small in this style and it's still roomy at that. It's cut VERY large.

Bahama II: Much like the Bonehead in terms of pockets, but it's made of a synthetic fabric. Breathes better and wrinkles less but can still wrinkle. The ""Super Bahama"" version has a print rather than solid colors. Heavier material than the Tamiami. I wear a small in this shirt as well. Not super lightweight but tougher and can be used as a work shirt.

Tamiami II: This seems like a refinement of the Bonehead and Bahama. Very light cloth, kind of parachute-like. Different pockets. This, to me, is the coolest (temperature-wise) shirt of the bunch. The ""Super Tamiami"" is the printed version. I wear a small in this one as well and it's my favorite for very hot weather but I would be very hesitant to wear it for work applications. Not as tough as the Bonehead or Bahama. Pretty much wrinkle-free.

Baitcaster: Lightweight like the Tamiami but different cut and different pockets. It's kind of a cleaner version of the Tamiami, however, because of the cut I wear a medium in this rather than the small in most of the others. I tried a small and it would button but was tight in the shoulders.

Low-Drag Offshore: Another lightweight version with far more conventional pockets and a very clean look. Some colors have contrasting stitching which, in my opinion, looks sharp. The sizing on this is smaller than the Bonehead/Bahama/Tamiami but slightly larger than the Baitcaster. I ordered a small and it fits, barely. By far my favorite design. When I order another I may or may not order up a size to a medium.

So there you go. If I seem addicted to these shirts it's because I am. In a hot climate you may be able to find a cooler shirt but if one exists I don't know about it. Retail you can expect to pay anywhere from $30-$60 for these but if you keep an eye out on Amazon getting them as cheap as $11 isn't unheard of. Money well-spent if you spend a lot of time outside.",B0002MGM4O
my favorite brand and style :-),B0002MGM4O
Ordered an XL but not happy at all with the fit. Its more like a 2XL!!,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt, just keep in mind that the sizes run slightly bigger.",B0002MGM4O
"Columbia makes some fantastic shirts, but make sure to order the appropriate size.  I am 510, 195 lbs, and would typically wear a Large in most similar styled (button-up) shirts, but I have to get a Medium in Columbia PFG shirts.  (The Medium is still a moderately loose fit, as the Large is like a tent on me).  Tip number two is that because these shirts are on different sizing scale, many get returned to the Amazon Warehouse, so keep an eye for Amazon Warehouse deals on these shirts (see tips to finds the easiest way to compare prices across sizes and colors at the conclusion of this review).  I have tried the Tamiami II, Bahama II, and Bonehead (AND new Blood & Guts III  see below for updated comparison including the BG3 series) versions of the Columbia PFG shirts, and have been mostly pleased with all of them.  The Tamiami II was my favorite due to the cooling effect of the weave, but the similar Blood & Guts III is now right there with it.  My reasoning for giving the Bahama II 4 starts instead of 5, is that out of the four series discussed in this review, it is my least favorite.  The Bahama II tends to wrinkle, is not as cool feeling in extreme heat as the open weave Tamiami or Blood&Guts, and the nylon tend to feel slimy during periods of heavy perspiration.  Below I have noted the differences in four of the PFG styles, for those trying to decide which shirt they may prefer.

TAMIAMI II STYLE (POLY) - SUMMERTIME CASUAL FAVORITE
The Tamiami II (T2) and the Blood & Guts III (BG3) are my favorite of the aforementioned PFG styles.  The main difference between each of these styles is material.  The T2 & BG3 are 100% polyester (liner and exterior), the Bahama II (Ba2) is nylon, and the Bonehead (BH) is poplin cotton.  The T2 is the thinnest/lightest (most breathable) material of the three styles, also has a slightly shinier appearance, and is probably the most wrinkle resistant of the three (as the fabric is less rigid that the nylon Bahama II or cotton Bonehead).  (Update 7/11/16  The Blood & Guts series is also breathable polyester similar to the Tamiami with a slightly different styling, and stain resistant fabric.  See update at end of review for full comparison.)  The T2 has a snap button pocket on top with Velcro pockets underneath on both sides, which I also prefer over the pocket style on the other two (Ba2 & BH have identical pocket styles).  The synthetic T2 and Ba2 both wick moisture and create a cooling effect better than the cotton BH, but the lightness and weave of the T2 makes it by far the coolest wearing of the three.  For outdoor activity in the heat and humidity of summer, it would definitely be my preferred choice.  The long-sleeve version is fantastic for offshore fishing when lightweight sun protection is essential.  The Ta series also does not wrinkle as badly as the Ba and BH series shirts do.  (The PFG apparel which has an SPF rating, such as the Tamiami & Blood/Guts series, has an open fabric weave which is lose enough to allow some penetration of UV through the material itself; which means the material is much more breathable ergo cool feeling, although technically you could get some UV exposure through the shirt.)

BAHAMA II STYLE (NYLON) - WORK WEAR IN MILD WEATHER
The Bahama II is the middle ground between the T2 and the BH.  It is synthetic - similar to the T2, but is a nylon exterior shell with a polyester liner (whereas T2 is poly liner and shell).  The pockets on the Ba are the same traditional Columbia PFG look as the pockets on the Bonehead.  The slightly more rigid feel of the nylon, also gives the Bahama a more traditional (cotton-look) appearance than the T2.  In a certain respect, the Ba nylon manages moisture better than the BH cotton version  i.e. it evaporates sweat more quickly.  On the other hand, the nylon does not absorb moisture as cotton does, so while it does dry faster, it has a slimy feel to when sweaty that simply is not comfortable.  The Bahama also wrinkles worse than any of the other PFG series shirts, so it is my least favorite series.  That said, it is still a good quality shirt, and makes for a great work shirt during temperate weather (i.e. when it isn't going to get slimy with sweat).

BONEHEAD STYLE (COTTON) - COOL WEATHER FAVORITE
Most everything has already been covered.  The BH and the aforementioned Ba styles look virtually identical.  Essentially, I like the Bonehead over the Bahama because it does not get that slimy feeling when you sweat, and it is slightly better from a wrinkle perspective.  The Bonehead is probably my favorite series when moisture management and cooling effect are not important, so I like these in long sleeve for fall and winter wear.  I also like the traditional appearance of the Ba and the BH for work wear, but the T2 look I like better for casual.  (The newer Blood & Guts series has the comfort of the Tamiami series, but has a look similar to the Bonehead, so it is my new favorite summertime work shirt.)  The Bonehead long sleeve also makes a great layering option for hunting season, and Sage is a great natural neutral (earth tone) color for this purpose.

UPDATE 7/11/16  BLOOD & GUTS III (POLY) - HOT WEATHER FISHING FAVORITE
When this review was originally posted, I only contrasted the Bahama, Tamiami, and Bonehead series shirts, but recently I have found a new favorite  the Blood & Guts III (BG3).  While the name may not be all that appealing, these are really great shirts.  They have an SPF rating, therefore breathable/open weave, similar to the Tamiami, with a styling that more closely resembles the Bahama & Bonehead series.  The BG3 is also treated for stain resistance, making it a great shirt for fishing, work, and outdoor activities.  Finally, the BG3 does not wrinkle nearly as severely as the Bahama nylon or Bonehead cotton shirts do.  Out of the four PFG series shirts discussed, the BG3 series probably have the tightest fit.  I still wear a medium in the BG3, but the series has a slimmer type cut than the previous versions discussed.  All in all, this is my favorite alongside the Tamiami.  I slightly prefer the Blood & Guts for fishing due to the stain resistance, whereas, I prefer the Tamiami for casual and boating wear just from an aesthetic standpoint.  The Tamiami may have the slightest of edges in the cooling department, but they are very close in that regard.

AMAZON PRICE COMPARISON & WAREHOUSE DEALS
I used to always get aggravated at the way Amazon list apparel items with multiple colors, as it can take forever to search through multiple color (and size) options to see the cheapest offerings.  On my iPad version the color prices are displayed in a list style automatically, but on my PC desktop I would have to select each color/size to see the price options.  I did not realize there is a much simpler way.  Select the new and used from (or new if no used offerings available) icon, which will take you to a list view.  There must be multiple offerings for the exact size and color selected for this option to appear, so if you do not see the new and used from hyper-link, then select another size/color combination till the link appears.)  In the list view screen, select your size and click the lowest offer for each icon beside the color selector.  It will display the cheapest offering for each color shirt in that size, so you can quickly see which colors are the cheapest.  Also, this view will show any Amazon Warehouse Deals available.  As mentioned in the first paragraph, these shirts get returned often due to sizing issues, so many times the Warehouse deals are shirts that were tried on and immediately returned for a smaller size.",B0002MGM4O
"I have five, they are not wrinkle free after wash however, but a nice shirt!",B0002MGM4O
"Nice shirt.  I usually wear an XL, but ordered a large this time....fits perfectly.",B0002MGM4O
Columbia makes good quality clothing--especially summer shirts.  This is no exception.,B0002MGM4O
Most comfortable shirt I have ever purchased.,B0002MGM4O
Exactly what I was looking for.  Bought several.,B0002MGM4O
This is a wonderful shirt.  My husband has 3.  The colors look like they do in the picture.  He wears an XXL normally and this shirt fits him well.  Light weight and comfortable,B0002MGM4O
"I should have listened to the comments, but of course I didn't. The shirt fits VERY large. I had to return it and get a size down, but thankfully they accepted the return without a restocking fee and no fuss. The fabric is nice, if somewhat ""delicate"", but hey you get what you pay for.",B0002MGM4O
Fit as expected but after I changed the size. I normally wear size M but in this kind of shirt I had to change from M to S as it comes really big. I went to a store and had the same result so is not the seller but the brand. Other than that everything was ok.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt - nice fit and very comfortable,B0002MGM4O
You can never go wrong with Columbia.  I normally wear a large but got this in a medium.  It fits like a large shirt that is a little on the small size.,B0002MGM4O
"great shirt, fit as expected, washes and wears well",B0002MGM4O
My husband loves this shirt and it is one of his favorites.  He tends to get hot easily and this allows him to cool down quicker than many other types of shirts.  He also likes the little pocket for pen. :),B0002MGM4O
Bumped into a rail on a deck and snagged fist time I wore it. Nice looking But the fabric is not for anything outdoors.,B0002MGM4O
"This item after being washed only 3 times has developed ""small pills"" on the fabric.  Not what I expect out of Columbia.  Evidently a return is not possible even though the shirt is useless.  Very upsetting.",B0002MGM4O
"A gentleman with whom I work wears these shirts and I liked them so much that I asked him about them. He gave me the information I needed to order one as a gift for my brother, who lives in a semi tropical environment. He really likes it! The colors are crisp and clean looking, and the specially designed ventilation adds comfort. The fabric is easy to care for. I will order more as gifts!",B0002MGM4O
this is exactly what you want.  Its light but sturdy and fits as expected.,B0002MGM4O
"No problems whatsoever with this shirt. Exactly what I thought it would be. If it fits ""Too Small"" or ""Too Large"", you aren't the size you think you are.",B0002MGM4O
"Some of the reviews mentioned the fact that one should order a size down from your normal.  Unfortunately, I failed to read them until afterwards, otherwise the shirt is excellent in all areas.",B0002MGM4O
"My favorite shirt on my husband.  easy to clean , very nice material.",B0002MGM4O
"Excelent fit, excelent quality, the best out there",B0002MGM4O

Great birthday gift for my Dad! Fit as expected.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt, I already own an identical black, and white shirt. Fits perfect. I like to wear these in the Florida summer when visiting theme parks. Keeps me cool in the hot sun.",B0002MGM4O
The person I bought it for really loved it!  and it fit perfectly!,B0002MGM4O
"very good shirt. good fit, great feel. is now my favorite comfortable shirt to put on. I got it embroidered and the fabric is holding up perfectly.",B0002MGM4O
My favorites for the weekend or fishing,B0002MGM4O
"Great looking practical short sleeve shirt.  I cycle commute to work almost every day - and I prefer to wear these synthetic SPF shirts that can look business casual (when paired with a good set of trousers).

This shirt is vented, light, and airy.  The large size that I have fits my shoulders nicely, but it quite loose and baggy around the middle - so you may have to tinker with your normal size.",B0002MGM4O
"I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted.",B0002MGM4O
This is a GREAT shirt!!  Can't go wrong!  The price is much better here too!,B0002MGM4O
"I have four of these shirts, all in different colors. I love them. They do run just a little large, but so do I. I stay very cool in these shirts.",B0002MGM4O
Excelent purchase..I'm  so happy with the product and  chosen size.,B0002MGM4O
they run a lil big so I ordered a med fit perfect. pleased all the way around,B0002MGM4O
"I got it for $24 dollars I believe, and that is an amazing deal for this shirt. These shirts are perfect for warm weather as they are very thin, cool, and sweat resistant. They only thing bad about them is they tend to come out of the dryer with rinkles, but that isn't a huge issue. Great shirt hands down.",B0002MGM4O
"These are great shirts. I have about 8 of them. I just pull them straight out of the dryer, hang them up, and wear without ironing.",B0002MGM4O
these are very nice summer shirts.,B0002MGM4O
"Excellent product, nice finish and fit (loose fit, very confortable).  Love the way it repels water by rolling down the drops over the fabric. Dryes in no time at all !",B0002MGM4O
Excellent shirt size to fit me like a very happy purchase,B0002MGM4O
"This particular design is my 3rd fishing shirt from Columbia, I LOVE IT! Comfortable, light, and durable...great price for a great product!",B0002MGM4O
"PFGs models are normally 1 to 2 size bigger.  I have been Columbia customer for a while.  Beside that... very comfy, excellent quality.",B0002MGM4O
Most comfortable shirt!  Will be buying in several colors,B0002MGM4O
Shirt fit as expected and I love to wear this shirt I plan to order a few more..,B0002MGM4O
Very comfortable and sporty shirt.  It's just right for this hot weather.  Lightweight and keeps me dry- lets the moisture out.,B0002MGM4O
"Most comfortable shirt I have ever worn.  Travel to the mid east monthly and this shirt is my new best friend.  Sizes do run large, but not a problem for me.  Love the back vent.  I just went back online and ordered my third shirt.",B0002MGM4O
I knew the sizes ran a little big,B0002MGM4O
Hubby loves these shirts.  They are his favorite.  Wash well and need no ironing. Whoopie!  Very nice looking and extremely comfortable.  Thanks,B0002MGM4O
"Love this shirt! Fit is great, the weight is perfect for the sweltering summers in the South. You should get one.",B0002MGM4O
Very nice fit.  Very cool when wearing,B0002MGM4O
My husband really likes these Columbia PFG shirts. They pack well and wash and dry with little effort.,B0002MGM4O
Love these light weight shirts.  Comfortable and very light weight for those hot summer days!,B0002MGM4O
"Well-made shirt.  Comfortable, fits well and hangs nicely.  The fabric is lightweight for comfort out in the sun, but seems a just little bit heavier than the Columbia Tamiami II.  Vented in the back for extra cooling.  Columbia shirts with UV protection are always comfortable, stylish, well made, and hold up nicely for a long time.",B0002MGM4O
This was a gift for my dad. He loves to fish.  I will be getting him the long sleeve shirt as well.,B0002MGM4O
"Definitely order a size smaller than you normally wear.  I read in several other reviews that they were oversized.  I took the advise and ordered them a size smaller.  They fit great, a little loose in fact.  Very comfortable shirt.  Great material.  I would and have recommend these shirts to anyone.",B0002MGM4O
Love these Columbia Bahama shirts.,B0002MGM4O
great shirts just buy a size smaller than normal if your a slim guy,B0002MGM4O
I ordered one of these for my boyfriend and he liked it so much he ordered two more !,B0002MGM4O
As expected. Great shirt.  I ordered five different colors.  Would recommend,B0002MGM4O
Excellent product. Absolutely love these shirts.,B0002MGM4O
I have always like this style shirt and got this one for Father's Day and it has quickly become my favorite!  It is very comfortable and light.  Has all the pockets you could ever want and if you get wet it dries so quickly. When we go hiking this is always the shirt I wear.,B0002MGM4O
Was going to order a size larger but read reviews indicating not to.  I wear 16 1/2 35-36 dress shirts and this size large fit just fine.  Love the thin light material; just what the doctor ordered for Central Florida in July.,B0002MGM4O
My husband loved this shirt!  I ordered two of them.  They are perfect especially in extreme heat!!,B0002MGM4O
My grandson loved it and he will grow quickly. It was a Men's shirt and he's 13 so big is ok.,B0002MGM4O
I bought as a gift for my dad for Father's Day and was a huge hit! He loved it! I bought the size according to reviews!,B0002MGM4O
"my height: 1.69 meters
my weight: 65 kg
I am a size M , this shirt is too big for me.",B0002MGM4O
Extremely happy with the fit and style.,B0002MGM4O
Bought as a gift. They like it but usually don't wear short sleeves.,B0002MGM4O
Very nice shirt.  Looks good on and fits well.  Good price.,B0002MGM4O
"Bought this for my husband who is 6'3"" XXL due to tummy. This shirt is flattering, easy wash and wear. And it is perfect for hot weather or boating. Dries quickly.",B0002MGM4O
My husband uses these for work shirts (he works outside). He said they are the best because they dry so quickly and don't stick to you like a cotton shirt would.,B0002MGM4O
Looks great and wears great.  Runs a tad large but cool,B0002MGM4O
"Great Product, quality as expected. Highly Recommended.",B0002MGM4O
"I like, just what I wanted.  I like these kind of shirts.  Fits exactly like I thought.  Good deal!!!",B0002MGM4O
If you don't like to iron do not buy this shirt,B0002MGM4O
excellent quality and good pricing,B0002MGM4O
Excellent quality! Great for any outdoor activity!,B0002MGM4O
Great Qualityand great color but runs large.  Living in the country of Panama this is a must shirt for staying cool!!,B0002MGM4O
"Fits nice, but comes out of the dryer very wrinkled. Ironing not my favorite activity",B0002MGM4O
"I love the shirt. I just wish I had gotten a size smaller, as these shirts are cut a little more generously.",B0002MGM4O
"It is great, and the price uhlala!",B0002MGM4O
"didn't notice a description on being an oversize shirt, but easily can fit that category (pun intended) ... it's great for hot summer days at the lake/beach or just by the pool ... color is exactly as shown too so no surprises there ... has great extra pockets for just about anything you can think of ...",B0002MGM4O
Great button up short sleeve shirt.. Dries quickly wicks the sweat from the body. Great in hot humid environment .  Not too mention people who sweat a lot like me!! Like the bright colors too. Available in other colors for those who are more reserved. Check it out,B0002MGM4O
Perfect fit!! Looks great!! Not wrinkle free though!,B0002MGM4O
My son in law loves these fishing shirts and this was a great buy on a Columbia.  Perfect color and fit.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought the Gulf Stream, Sunlit and Black as gifts (approx. 6'1""/195lbs) and we are both very pleased with the quality, feel of the material and colors.

I listened to other reviewers and sized down.  Normally I would have bought an XL, but instead I purchased a Large.  The Large is still very roomy/not fitted, but I feel it is meant to be comfy for fishing.

The material feels a bit like mens swimsuit material.",B0002MGM4O
My son loved his Father's Day gift.  I will definitely be order again.,B0002MGM4O
I am glad I read all the reviews before I ordered this shirt. I am a XXL but ordered an XL. It fits perfectly. It is cool and comfortable. Highly recommended.,B0002MGM4O
Came on time as promised. Love it!!,B0002MGM4O
"This shirt does run VERY LARGE.  I am normally a large and fit perfect in a medium.

The shirt is super lightweight and really helps keep you cool on super hot days.  I wore it in Florida recently and when it got wet it was usually dry in a few minutes.  Super for hot climate where you want to keep the sun off your skin.  Combine with a sun hat and you are all set!",B0002MGM4O
"Beautiful color, cheaper than what it costs at the ""outlets"", big pockets up top for my iPhone, covers my 9mm on my belt.",B0002MGM4O
"Comfortable in the Houston heat and humidity.  Light weight, breathable and nice enough to wear out to a casual dinner.",B0002MGM4O
"These great shirts run almost a size too big, so make sure to allow for that, unless you're wearing a tee-shirt under them.",B0002MGM4O
Great timeless design.  Roomy perfect fit and great color!,B0002MGM4O
I have ordered the some size long and short sleeve of these shirts. I guess it is because there is more arm and shoulder room but the short sleeve shirts feel looser than expected. This isn't necessarily bad though because it is very airy and keeps you cool,B0002MGM4O
"Wish they were cheaper, but nice shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"I have several of these shirts, this one was purchased on line, the others in the Columbia outlet store. This one fits on the large side. Will have it taken in as I like it a lot.",B0002MGM4O
"I like PFGs, and this one is no exception. I got the blue one because I didn't have a blue SS. Durable, lightweight material that helps keep you cool. Would recommend to serious fishers or people just wanting to look like a fisher.",B0002MGM4O
"Wonderful shirt....wonderful fit, wonderful buy.",B0002MGM4O
My favorite line of shirts. Extremely comfortable and the perfect sport (fishing) wear!,B0002MGM4O
"Fits good, but looses character after washing.",B0002MGM4O
"Looks great on him, fits as expected and washes and dries well.  Well made shirt!  He loves it...that's what really counts!",B0002MGM4O
Husband says it is the shirt the keeps him the coolest in warm weather.  Design of back makes movement easy.,B0002MGM4O
This shirt is roomier than the tamiami however I love these shirts!,B0002MGM4O
Wow great price for this shirt! Great quality!,B0002MGM4O
very nice I love it when other people look at it with envy !1,B0002MGM4O
"Want to look like an official Florida Sports Fisherman? This is the shirt for you. Great fit, great in the heat and sun while on a boat or in the high desert of New Mexico. I wear these Columbia shirts for work, while mowing the grass, and around the house. You can not go wrong.",B0002MGM4O
The Columbia was a gift and it was excelent!!!,B0002MGM4O
I liked the shirt in all respects.,B0002MGM4O
"Got this as a Father's Day gift for my Dad.  He liked the yellow color, not to bright, not too pastel.  I have a couple pairs of Columbia PFG pants and love them...just keep in mind that while this material dries quickly, provides sun protection and is fairly cool, it does not stretch much at all.  This shirt in particular is about a half size larger than what it says on the tag.  Better to be too loose than too small though!",B0002MGM4O
Ordered this for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it. Very cool,B0002MGM4O
"I work out in fields as a consultant and these shirts are perfect. It normally gets around 95 everyday in my area but always feels 104-108 with the humidity. These shirts are so cool and comfortable that it is almost like you don't even have a shirt on. I also like how water just seems to beed off these shirts if it rains. Great product and some say get a smaller size, but in my experience this shirt fits true to size. I think some people are confusing the Bahamas Columbia shirt with the bonehead Columbia shirts which are one size bigger than label.",B0002MGM4O
Columbia products are well known and respected by backpackers. The shirts are very light weigh yet very durable. They wick moisture away and dry quickly keeping you cooler than cotton. I have several of these and they have remained wrinkle free despite many washings. I will buy them again if the old ones ever wear out.,B0002MGM4O
Excellent. I'll buy again as these wear out.,B0002MGM4O
Another great product. Just pulled out for our summer time,B0002MGM4O
"Ordered a Large and it measures 52 inches at chest ....... 54 at hip
Shirt is great, but way, way too LARGE ...... would have returned it but was not home to do so .............",B0002MGM4O
I love this shirt so much I want it in all colors. And it fit so nice it gives your body a nice shape. lol,B0002MGM4O
"Good quality shirt. I thought all the Columbia shirts had the same fabric. Learned the hard way that some are 100% cotton and some are nylon. Glad my son did not notice that the black one I just got him was nylon. The polyester is better. The cotton is awful. They have the same na me on the three fabrics because the style is the same. So, if you want the better shirt look carefully for the fabric. The cotton, no matter what you do is wrinkled. Very hard to get the wrinkles out even when ironed. He will wear it out m on the boat...maybe. glad I got it on sale. The last one I got was black and has white buttons. I didn't think it would matter but it does. The black buttons would have looked much nicer.",B0002MGM4O
Awesome light weight shirt! God looking and fits nice!,B0002MGM4O
"great shirt, not as soft as the columbia tamiami ones but still very light.  great for hot days.",B0002MGM4O
"Great Shirt for the price,  It keeps you cool in the summer, especially in the Texas heat.  Can be used in Outdoor activities as well.",B0002MGM4O
"good price and very nice shirt, i bought a blue PFG shirt from academy sport for 40.00 just a week ago wished i would have looked here 1st",B0002MGM4O
Great summer shirt for most occasions.,B0002MGM4O
Great Company!  Good fit & lots of color selections.,B0002MGM4O
I use this every day and love it the older bahama had a better fabric,B0002MGM4O
WHY can't they make shirts like these in the good ol US of A.,B0002MGM4O
"My husband is 6'4"" 220 lbs and these shirts fit him perfectly!",B0002MGM4O
very cool and comfortable with a relaxed fit resists water is very stylish with compliments and questions from other men,B0002MGM4O
"Lightweight, breathable, comfortable. Perfect summer shirt.",B0002MGM4O
Love that peach shirt.  Want more colors just like it,B0002MGM4O
My husband was very happy with his Columbia shirt. It looked good and was comfortable,B0002MGM4O
"Medium is way to big, but maybe US size so watch out. Otherwise it is perfect.",B0002MGM4O
"I wear a XL and I ordered a L because of reviews I should have ordered a M the L is even way to big, I tried washing it on hot and hi temp drying but it didn't shrink and now I guess I cant return it..",B0002MGM4O
Beautiful color. Much cheaper then at Academy. My husband loves it,B0002MGM4O
You need to order 1 or 2 sizes smaller....shirt is great other than that.,B0002MGM4O
"Love the color, fit & feel of this shirt on my husband. Great purchase",B0002MGM4O
Finally found a Columbia guide shirt in white!  If you've owned one of these shirts you know the quality and fit are exceptional.  If you haven't then you should!,B0002MGM4O
"Other reviewers had accurately stated that the shirt fits on the large side.  Based on their advice, instead of getting the normal medium size, I went with the small.  The small fits just like most of my other medium size shirts.  I like the look and feel - this is a very comfortable shirt.",B0002MGM4O
Exactly what my husband wanted.  Lightweight and washes beautifully.,B0002MGM4O
Husband looks good in these shirts and I am saving it for Father's Day,B0002MGM4O
"All shirts fit well and are tailored very well.  Design is very good,",B0002MGM4O
"I've bought probably 5 of these as gifts. One recipient has very sensitive skin and can only wear the softest of materials.  He has several of these.  It's the perfect fishing shirt, with all of them commenting on air flowing through the shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"I have 3 or 4 Columbia PFG shirts, two pairs of pants, five pairs of shorts and two convertibles. Does that tell you what I think of Columbia Sportswear?",B0002MGM4O
"Great fit for my odd shaped upper body. Comfortable and cool! The right design for casual desert wear, day and night.",B0002MGM4O
"Buy two sizes down!  The sizing is different than other Columbia shirts.  This shirt is super wide.  Great shirt otherwise.  More green and less gray-green than pictured, but still a nice color.",B0002MGM4O
This is cool and my husband spent the day working and sweating outside.  He came in the house and the shirt was completely dry!  A t-shirt would have been soaked by the time he sweated that much!,B0002MGM4O
"Love these shirts...real cotton...they breath, built in mesh and stay looking nice wash after wash...I have had it with all this polyester self wicking ""made with motor oil"" under armor BS.",B0002MGM4O
Good quality shirt put fits to large for the size.,B0002MGM4O
"Somewhat different pockets than the Bonehead shirt I normally wear, and also a smoother softer feel to the fabric.  Might not quite hold a kindle in these pockets as easily as the boneheads...",B0002MGM4O
"I really like these shirts, but I wish the pockets would lie flat when empty.",B0002MGM4O
"This is a nice shirt, it is comfortable, and fits well.  However, for me it was only good for one wear.  The shirt comes out of the wash too wrinkled to wear.  Upon my surprise, the fabric literally melts instantly upon contact with an iron.  Be sure to read the care instructions first (no ironing, no steam, no dry cleaning).  Not bad if you don't mind wearing wrinkled clothing.",B0002MGM4O
"Great Shirt, comfortable and cool to wear. I will get a couple more in differtent colors.",B0002MGM4O
"fits my husband well and he states it is very comfortable and likes the yellow.  washes well and even if wrinkled, when left in dryer, he wears it and the wrinkles disappear quickly",B0002MGM4O
"Very light, cool shirt.  Could be a bit longer in the tail.  Would be nice if squared off so it could be worn outside.  Very comfortable- great for travel.",B0002MGM4O
I would order 1 size smaller than usual.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought my husband two of these shirts for his birthday and he loves them!! He had bought one of these shirts about four years ago and it quickly became one of his favorite shirts!! He loves the vented area on the back because it keeps him cool! The shirts arrived on time, the fabric is lightweight and cool, the colors are beautiful, the quality is great!! Awesome shirts for the price!!",B0002MGM4O
I love this kind of shirt whenever I can get my wife to press it for me.,B0002MGM4O

Great price. Fits great. Academy sports had this same shirt for $47....,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt that was very comfortable during my 2 weeks in St John. I think i wore it 7 days out of 14. Loved how it kept me cool with the breeze blowing through the mesh seams,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. Well made and accurate description...  Plus it got here quick,B0002MGM4O
"Very nice material, very well constructed. A little wide in fit, but otherwise a great shirt.",B0002MGM4O
Runs a little small. Material is a little heavier than the Tamiami II shirt.,B0002MGM4O
The white fabric its made of became a white and yellowist color after several uses so if you don t want to deal with don't get it,B0002MGM4O
Looks like in the picture it's amazing,B0002MGM4O
I bought a size S as a present for my husband but the shirt was huge and it didn't fit,B0002MGM4O
"Color nothing close to the color shown. Was much darker when it came in.
The shirt that came in was mucky green. It will do. But I wish it had
looked more like the color in the picture. Nice shirtwrong color2 1/2...",B0002MGM4O

Sizes seem to run on the large side. Comfortable shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"This fits perfectly because I read the reviews for this shirt before I ordered it.  Most reviews recommended that you order one size less than you normally do.  Glad I took that advise.  This shirt runs very large.  It's very well made and a has a lite fabric, it's not a cheap fabric just a well made lite fabric, perfect for summer.",B0002MGM4O
Very nice shirt. Can wear it with any type of pants or shorts.  We were happy that we bought two different colors.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought a different color as a gift, and he liked it so well I ordered this one too.",B0002MGM4O
I'm a big guy and being a big guy I have a hard time finding shirts that look professional and hold up to what I do inside and out. These fit the bill perfectly and they are functional.

These shirts are the best for summer time and anytime you plan on getting hot or wet.  Dries quick and is breathable.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought several of these shirts for a recent trip to Singapore where I knew a well vented shirt would be welcome. It performed exactly as expected, with one exception. These shirts wrinkle a lot, and I spent the entire trip looking like I had just crawled out of bed.",B0002MGM4O
"I own a long sleeve from the same brand, the Med size on this product is much larger than the other. Disapointed.",B0002MGM4O

"My hubby works outdoors in extreme heat and swears by these lovely, colorful, comfy shirts.  PS The sizing Is very generous.",B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt  and fit above expectations,B0002MGM4O
As the shirt is all synthetic and a tight weave it is basically like wearing a plastic bag. I sweat like a stuck pig wearing it and as such don't wear it. If you perspire even a little bit stay away from this shirt!,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt, fit was standard for most XXL sizes across different brands! Worked really well.",B0002MGM4O
"Perfect s***s for fishing or doing a bbq outdoors. As with all Colombia clothing you must order a size smaller unless you like it to fit big. I am 6'2"" 200lbs and a medium fits perfect. I usually wear a large with other clothing. I have this in short sleeve and long and in about 4 colors.  You cannot best Colombia's quality for the price. Don't hesitate to purchase.",B0002MGM4O
"I work Quality Control at a fabrication plant. I am outside all day either in the shop or in the sun looking at oil and gas equipment. My shop has a high standard for cleanliness, quality, and proficiency/efficiency. That and my position requires me too often ""dress to impress"" as the sales team is always riding around with customers showing them the facility and as you would expect they always want to talk to the QC guy. Ive tried ""polo"" style shirts, T-shirts, and many other button up shirts. I always got Pit stains and a big wet spot on my back. to be expected I cover 30 acers on foot several times a day. finally I broke down a got these Columbia shirts.

They are nice thin and breathable without being see-though the material is durable and can take some abuse. my favored part is the back were the shirt has vents that allow a constant air flow. These shirts really make a difference. They absorb moisture but it doesn't show unless its a lot and they air dry rather quickly. Since Ive started wearing these I feel cooler Im not seating through my cloths as often and I just over all feel more comfortable especial when Im standing in front of a salesman and customer ""pit stain free"".

I whole heartedly love these shirts and would recommend them to anyone who wants to stay cool and dry in a hot or humid work environment while still maintaining a  professional look.",B0002MGM4O
excellent seller highly recommend,B0002MGM4O
"I gave it as a gift, and it fit perfectly and he wore it often!",B0002MGM4O
"It's the textura that cautivates me because when you're fishing in a 40*C , 104*F, the least you want is being uncomfortable so you concentrate in the fins and not the heat.",B0002MGM4O
hi i recive my shirt with a yellow spot on the shirt and with a big smell,B0002MGM4O

These shirts fit good and wear extremely well! Highly recommend these...,B0002MGM4O
"Bought this for my husband to wear on a mission trip. He was in some very rugged places. Shirt was easy to wash and quick to dry in the sink or with a hose and did not stink (big deal!). Quality was perfect. Runs LARGE. Husband 5'9 and wears a 33 jean, had to exchange the medium (his size in polos) for a small. Small fit perfect, not too tight but also did not look like a paper bag.",B0002MGM4O
an excellent product. Fabric so soft. Normally size M on others brands is smaller than this one. Recommend buy a downsize as normally wear,B0002MGM4O

"Great shirts.  I have nearly all their colors.  They hold up,  wash after wash.  no fading. great comfort.",B0002MGM4O
"I based my purchase on the comments that said had to choose a smaller size at which use regularly, but it was a mistake,
I usually use XL and i order size L, The shirt closes me but still tight, I had to return, so be careful when buying.
It is best to check your size in a store on your country and ask the exact size, not based on the comments.
The factory always produces the same sizes defined in their page,
It is absurd to think Columbia's manufactured Supersized as  said on comments, they (Columbia) manage quality standards.
It was a mistake on my part to trust on the comments,
I recommend if you are using size XL in Columbia, require this size, not based on reviews, best based on their own experience with this brand Size.
Greetings from Guatemala",B0002MGM4O
"It is a nice looking shirt, i am 5 feet 6"" tall and ordered a  X-small size and it was a bit on loose to me.
So better to order a smaller size that u normally order as it goes big.
Apart from that its a gr8 looking shirt nice and airy good for summers to keep you cool from the inside.
Go for it.",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt.  Super lightweight and has the expected Columbia Quality.  I live in a tropical climate, it's perfect.",B0002MGM4O
Great travel shirt. Excellent for doing business in hot / humid climates like Hong Kong and Singapore. I own an assortment of different colors with a total of about eight. They are all well made and holding up well.,B0002MGM4O
the M size is too fat for a man tall 177cm & weight 70KG,B0002MGM4O
Very fresh and light. Ideal for hot summer days.,B0002MGM4O
"Excellent, but require a great deal of precise ironing. Dry cleaning can be expenive",B0002MGM4O
"Perfect fit and excellent quality, just what I wanted. I will request additional shirts soon.",B0002MGM4O
Love these shirts. Easy washing and always look nice.,B0002MGM4O
"Great Quality Shirt at a fair price. Fit is a little large, so I'd suggest stepping down a size unless you like your shirts really loose.",B0002MGM4O
"I got one of these for my dad for Christmas. He is a fisherman and doesn't have any quality shirts like this. I listened to the other reviews and got a size smaller than he usually needs, and it fit him just fine. The fabric is really nice and light weight, with plenty big pockets. My dad loves his shirt and wears it maybe a little too much, haha. Every birthday or father's day, he asks me if I got him another shirt! I finally got him a few more! They are a great buy and I recommend them to anyone who is the outdoorsy type!",B0002MGM4O
Good shirt. Runs large by one size.,B0002MGM4O
Loved the way it looks on my husband.,B0002MGM4O
"Ordered this shirt in size ""S"" because of all the reviews stating that comes larger than the actual size.  I normally wear size ""M"", and this one still fits a little bit loose but I think that's just a part of Columbia's shirts. Not disappointed.",B0002MGM4O
"A great shirt, Love the fast dry feature, will be buying more for sure.",B0002MGM4O
"Really liked the orange shirt, althought the color is very different from what is depicted in the photo.  The orange is more of a flourescent orange rather than a bursting blast of orange as depicted in the photo.  The material and construction of the shirt was great with no frayed threads like I've seen on some of the other Bahama II's I've ordered.

Overall, if your timing is right, great shirt for the price on Amazon and well worth the purchase.  I wear these everyday basically as my work shirts and love them!",B0002MGM4O
"Lindas, el producto cumpli con mis expectativas!",B0002MGM4O
great product! recommended. good quality and design.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt.....Does fit a little big but I like it that way!,B0002MGM4O

very trendy shirt right now very hot,B0002MGM4O
"Fits as expected, great color! My boyfriend loves it!",B0002MGM4O
"What is needed in manufacturing land is quality in regard to size and proportional dimensions. For this price, you would think they would produce a 3x, & not skimp on the materials.",B0002MGM4O
"Ordered a Sail (light blue XL), but when it arrived it was dark blue. Would've had to send it back anyhow, because although it runs large, I still require an XXL. So far so good. The shirt arrived today and I'm quite happy. It is unique and nicely designed. Can't wait to break it in, and I may even buy more colors.",B0002MGM4O
"Excellent Shirt, comfortable and good quality.",B0002MGM4O
Our son loves the Bahama II shirt he got for his birthday!  It was a choice of his from the internet.,B0002MGM4O
Very comfortable and breathable shirt!! Fits to size.,B0002MGM4O
Columbia brand shirts are a family favorite,B0002MGM4O
"I bought this for a vacation trip with the idea I'd use it for fishing eventually.  I like it so much now, I wear it to work on casual Friday.  The fit of the Medium is good for me, shoulders fit, body is loose but hangs well (I'm 5' 8"" and 160 lbs on the lean side).  The thing I like most is the way if feels when I wear it, like there is no shirt at all.  It is remarkably cool to wear and the fabric feels soft.  I have some other technical shirts that are scratchy, not this one.  I've washed it 6 times by now and the color and shape are unchanged.  It's a very bright, light yellow color.",B0002MGM4O
hubby luved them...excellent choice,B0002MGM4O
"Very comfortable and Beautiful shirt, Columbia quality all over. Beware whith the size. Doesn't wrinkle, and is very cool for wearing in hot weather. the  UPF protection is a plus",B0002MGM4O
"I first ordered an XXL but it was too big, so exchanged it for XL which fit better. It is really comfortable to wear in hot and cool weather alike.",B0002MGM4O
Bought for my husband.  He loves it!  (I was asked to purchase other colors) this shirt breathes and has been great for our travels,B0002MGM4O
Awesome as always!  Great product; perfect transaction.,B0002MGM4O
"The fabric is really bad, does not breath at all, good thing I read about the sizes, I ordered XS and still big, normally I wear M-L, total waste of money.",B0002MGM4O
"I love these shirts.  I have bought several of them this year and will buy more.  They are extremely comfortable, nice looking, wash & wear, stain resistent and dry quickly.  Perfect for summers in the deep south.",B0002MGM4O
"good buy, my husband would charm",B0002MGM4O
"Doesn't wrinkle, and is very cool for wearing in hot weather. I like it very much and plan to order a few more.",B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt althought I think I would have ordered a color other then white. However I do recomend the shirt for summer activities.,B0002MGM4O
"My second Columbia shirt and really like it. I only use them for kayaking and find them very comfortable and quick drying. Made a mistake on the second shirt and ordered a large instead of medium. If you happen to be a size 40 suit jacket you will find the medium is a very good fit. In all my other regular shirts I usually buy large because I like a looser fit, but the Columbia is perfect in medium.
The material takes a lot of punishment and sometimes after a trip I think 'well, I trashed it this time', but it comes out of the wash as good as new.",B0002MGM4O
"Yes, they are cut bigger than you expect but I was looking for that so it works well.",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt - looks good, feels good",B0002MGM4O
"Son took this shirt to SE Asia, where he trekked across country and had to do his wash by hand. This shirt dried within minutes, he says, and even after getting caught in a monsoon, within half an hour he could put it back on. Looks good, too, incredibly cool and comfortable, and didn't wrinkle at all. Looked as good when he got home as it had when he took the tags off. It's expensive, but so well engineered and made that it's worth it if you're spending any time in a hot, humid climate. Much cooler than a tee-shirt.",B0002MGM4O
My husband loved the shirt. It washed great and he loved all the pockets.,B0002MGM4O
Great shirts.  The sizes run larger.  He usual wears an xl and I ordered a large based on other reviews.  Fit was perfect.,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirts for fishing and casual wear. Cool and comfortable. They do run a bit large, but I have one in my normal size as well as a couple one size down and they're all fine.",B0002MGM4O
A pretty disappointing piece of clothing!,B0002MGM4O
Shirt was size large like all my other shirts. However was huge wore it 1 day. Probably will not wear again,B0002MGM4O
Best Shirts for outdoor activites,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt.  Well-made and sized nicely.,B0002MGM4O
best shirt husband owns he is happy boy,B0002MGM4O
"too small, me quedo gigante, una talla inmensa",B0002MGM4O
"Very nice shirt. Runs very big,though had to give to my uncle. A medium is like an xl.",B0002MGM4O
Really like the fit and feel of this shirt. Will be buying more,B0002MGM4O
Arrived in plenty time and fits well,B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt. Especially for the days when you expect it to be sticky and humid. Its light weight makes it perfect for the hottest days but a not warm enough for the cooler days or evenings. The sunscreen effect is a nice addition to those spending the day outside on the water or near the beach. The downside if there is one that it is very casual and not suited for evening dining at upscale beach restaurants.,B0002MGM4O
"Product of an impressive quality and durability, is excellent I recommend it",B0002MGM4O
"Learned a lesson here, Didn't try it on for a month after I got it. Then it's to late to return. I bought 2 of these and they are not just a little large, not a lot large they are circus tents. If you buy this shirt and normally wear XL get a medium and then have it tailored.",B0002MGM4O
I am glad I read the reviews about ordering down a size for these shirts.  I normally wear a Large size but after trying one on it felt like I was wearing a curtain.  Dropped down to a Medium and BOOM issue solved.  Awesome shirt especially in South Florida Climate.  I just ordered 3 more shirts in a Medium.,B0002MGM4O
Excellent Product!!! Recommended 100%!!!,B0002MGM4O
Great lite weight gear for summers in Florida,B0002MGM4O
Great material and color and fit.!!  LOVE it!,B0002MGM4O
"Way way to big for an XL shirt..
This is more like XXXL size! Can't wear it! Tent size :(",B0002MGM4O
"Shirt runs BIG so get a size or even 2 smaller.  Luckily I read the reviews and did so myself.

Otherwise great material, and wonderful for outdoor excursions.",B0002MGM4O
"I had been disappointed with my recent purchases of Columbia goods, but these shirts are really of high quality.  The material is very pleasant and air circulation is excellent, whether the shirt is worn tucked in the pants or over them.  The cut is definitely on the ample side, so the people who always order one size over their real one should be careful with this item.  The only thing I don't like much, and take a point off for (but wish I could take a half point off only), is that the color is not as it appears on the web site.  I had ordered the ""Capri"" and the ""Bright Peach"" colors.  Both shirts are a lot more vivid in reality than I expected/hoped.  Furthermore, the ""Capri"" is much more blue (no hint of green at all on the real shirt) that what is pictured on the site.",B0002MGM4O
the shirt quality is very good! but M is very very big than usually M !if you buy it please take a little code than usually!,B0002MGM4O
"Piss off your co-workers who can't afford 40 dollar shirts and look like a real frat daddy at the same time!
Just kidding but really, one of the guys I kinda work with who has an IQ of room temperature doesn't like to look nice. I do and feel for the price of one of these it is worth it. A comfortable, utilitarian, flashy shirt will surely catch peoples attention.",B0002MGM4O
"Great Shirt, easy care and fits perfectly, my husband wants more shirts!",B0002MGM4O
I'm very pleased with my purchase. This was the first time I purchased a shirt of this kind. I love the back vent.,B0002MGM4O
"Good fitting shirt, the color was off from what the pic represented.",B0002MGM4O
"This was my second Columbia Omni shade shirt.  Great Shirt but Runs BIG! I usually like my shirts big, but you can almost by 2 sizes smaller than you usually do, certainly at least one.  I am  42"" chest and the medium was still way big through the chest and shoulders.  I got a small and there is plenty of room.",B0002MGM4O
nice and I'm no going thru this everytime I make a damn order,B0002MGM4O
Ordered and received fast and right size  and color I wanted. Thanks very much.,B0002MGM4O

"bought as a gift, was well liked",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt for hot weather in deep south.  Very light but protective from sun and bugs.  Pockets on both front sides to hold glasses and sunglasses, etc.  Cooling flap in back.  These shirts are not just for fishing, but great for daily wear.  Hint:  don't wear a t-shirt under these when you are working outside.  The fabric will adsorb sweat and evaporate it much better when in contact with skin.",B0002MGM4O
I bought this for my husband and he loves to wear it. Very comfortable in the warm weather. Nice change from the polo shirts he likes to wear.,B0002MGM4O
A very light and breezey summer shirt ! great material and nice cut. I have no idea how durable it is. We shall see what it looks like after a year !,B0002MGM4O
"I own several of these Columbia shirts ... same model.  This one, however, was cut smaller.  The sleeves were about an inch shorter than the rest.  I'm tall and need the length.  First time I've ever encountered a sizing issue with a Columbia product ... but it happens sometimes I suppose.",B0002MGM4O
"I like the shirt, but it is big.  I typically run between XL and XXL, so I got the XL.  But even that was still too big.  But this was my first Columbia shirt and i love the material, feels great.  Good ventilation.",B0002MGM4O
I buy these all of the time for husband. He loves them in all colors. Because he fishes I buy a new white one each year,B0002MGM4O
"I really like Columbia shirts, but the men's run SOOOOO big!  I prefer men's shirts because they are almost always cut longer in length and have bigger pockets than women's and I am pretty flat chested, so it has always been my preference.  I first ordered a size Small and it was HUGE!  I have a large chested friend that wears a size XL in the Women's Columbia Tamiami II shirts - the Men's Small Bahama was. Little big on her!  So, I returned the Small and exchanged it for an Extra Small - The XS was NOT much smaller than the small :(  I didn't have my friend try the XS, I just returned it.

The shirt is great, if you can find your size.  I ended up ordering a women's small Bahama.  For a women's shirt, the length is longer and pockets bigger than most. Still had to knock off one star for the sizing.  Amazon's return policy takes the stress out of online clothes shopping - just be sure you are buying from Amazon if your not sure about your size.",B0002MGM4O
I haven't rec'd this particular shirt yet but I have already bought 4 of them.  This shirt is my fifth.  Needless to say I love them.  I live is the deep south so having something cool to wear in the summer months is critical.  They are extremely comfortable.  They dry quick if they get wet and are easy to care for.  Cannot beat wash and wear!  If I could wear these shirts year-round I would do it.  Other guys have told me they really like their Bahama shirts too. I will be buying more but probably not until next summer. I hope the prices stay resonable.,B0002MGM4O
My husband loves this shirt to wear while sailing!,B0002MGM4O
"I liked the fit and feel of this shirt so much I ordered 2 more in different colors. I don't do much fishing, but great for cool, comfortable casual wear.",B0002MGM4O
Great brand and comfortable to wear,B0002MGM4O
"Bahama II short sleeve shirt fits well and I like the color, but whoever designed the pockets was out to lunch.  Surprisingly, there is no dedicated space for a pen.  The main breast pockets are large and functional, but the additional smaller pockets are absolutely worthless for anything - they are practically sewn shut - both sides of each of these smaller pockets is sewn down tight.  No, sir, I will stick with the Columbia Bonehead shirts.  I just wish that the Commando color of the Bahama II was available in the Bonehead series.  I will neither buy another of these Bahama II shirts nor recommend them to anybody.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirts and a great price!,B0002MGM4O
Great shirts. Great Price. Real comfortable.,B0002MGM4O
Awesome shirt. Buy one size down from what you normally wear.,B0002MGM4O
"I'm a Columbia ""fan"" and this is the first time I've bought TALL because I have never seen them in the stores.  I'm 6'4"" and really appreciate the added length.  VERY Happy!  I will never shop for Columbia shirts in the stores again!",B0002MGM4O
"First look) Material is so glass and hot, size is very big. I have a xxl size, and I bought xl size, but still big and long. Worry.",B0002MGM4O
"I love this shirt. Not as over-sized as many reviewers warned but still fits if not as roomy as I usually wear. I took the advise of other reviewers and ordered one size smaller (M) than I typically wear (L). Next time I order this shirt, and I will, I'll just get my usual Large. cheers",B0002MGM4O
"Medium wouldn't fit me, and Large is too wide. It is wider than it is longer. The picture must be of a small or medium, because the large and XL is too wide for my liking.",B0002MGM4O
GREAT PRODUCT AND VERY COMFORTABLE!!!,B0002MGM4O
I bought this shirt and the Columbia PFG Tamiami II short sleeve shirt. The Tamiami II is a better fitting shirt. The front pockets do not bellow out like they do on this shirt. I would not recommend this shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"When it's 95 degrees and 75% Humidity, in Texas, playing Golf, it is a little more comfortable even though you are still wet. Better than wearing a wet Golf knit shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"Love it!  It is cool in hot weather, comfortable, clever pockets.  Very well-designed, and beautiful color.",B0002MGM4O
"It is cool, colour is my favorite blue,and easy to wear. Nothing to complain,and wonderfull.
I like columbia's Shirts. prriod",B0002MGM4O
"Fantastic work shirts, Orange Blast for the safety of it all.
Very cool in the summer, one of the best for the cost.",B0002MGM4O
Exactly as ordered - good quality - color as presented,B0002MGM4O
Great fishing shirt - Perfect fit!,B0002MGM4O
"Purchased this shirt for my daughter, who needed a cool light-weight shirt for working outdoor this summer! Really did the job BUT with Columbia, I have never purchased anything that wasn't EXCELLENT!",B0002MGM4O
Sizes runs BIG! But other than that this a great shirt!,B0002MGM4O
"Excellent shirt, fits as expected. I would advice you that this type of shirt is bigger than expected! Be aware of it",B0002MGM4O
"I've worn these Columbia shirts for years.  They are comfortable, durable and stylish.  Also, they come in a large assortment of colors.  Overall, these are my favorite shirts.",B0002MGM4O
"I love these shirts.  Great quality and relaxed, comfortable fit.  Just about all I wear for shirts now.",B0002MGM4O
Great fit - wear for leisure or business casual. Wash & wear. Dries fast.,B0002MGM4O
Love!  Great fit and material for the summer heat.,B0002MGM4O
"Really like there shirts. Lightweight, cool to wear& gives UV protection I wanted. I have several.",B0002MGM4O
"I just bought this product and I should have listened to what the reviews stated regarding the size issue. You really need to go down one size, if you wear Large you should buy a Medium etc, other than that this shirt is so comfy and the material is just great. I live in Kuwait (The hottest spot on the planet, literally) where temperatures reach 140 degrees in summer, I used to fish wearing old T-Shirts but now I would never wear anything else other than Columbia fishing apparel. The cooling system of the shirt works great, the pockets are really handy and free movement is second to none.",B0002MGM4O
"The shirt is wonderful, it keeps you cool on hot days.  The sizes however run a little big.  I'm a bigger guy who wears 2xl, it fits comfortably, just could have been a little smaller.",B0002MGM4O
great summer and outdoor wear shirts for the price,B0002MGM4O
Bahama II SS shirt is as good as the other 3 I have with vented back.,B0002MGM4O
Good Quality however they run unusually large. Order size below what you would expect to order.,B0002MGM4O
"I love the shirt.
cool in this hot and humid climate especially living in singapore.
The one fault I have discovered is the size are too large for me.
shud have taken L instead since i am asian size.
hope no one noticed over size shirt when i am wearing it LOL..
 Other than this the shirt is great",B0002MGM4O
"Another excellent shirt from Columbia. Fits my 300 lb, XXL body loosely, but looks good. I would recommend this to my friends.",B0002MGM4O
"I like it, good team, good material, durable, attractive, durable, good price, good condition, durable, good looks, easy to use, always works.",B0002MGM4O
"I run between a size Large and Medium, depending on the shirt.  Even within the Columbia brand some shirts fit me better in a Large and some in a Medium.  Based on the other reviews of the shirts being too big, I ordered a Medium.  The shirt fits perfect.  I've washed it a few times since purchase, sometimes I've air dried it and other times I put it through the dryer.  I must say it comes out of the dryer very nice.  I have caught it just as the end of the cycle and removed it before it sat there with a chance to become wrinkled.

I ordered the Bright Peach color and every time I wear it, I get a lot of compliments.  Highly recommend the Bahama II Shirt.  I also ordered the Tamiami II shirt and I like this shirt better. They both fit the same however the Bahama shirt has a tigher weave and comes closer to looking like a regular shirt (cotton) than the Tamiami shirt does.",B0002MGM4O
"Love the shirt, but we had to return it for a smaller size in Fossil and it's a great shirt.",B0002MGM4O
This shirt (XXL) fits as expected. It is a very comfortable shirt and I will get more like it. I feel comfortable recommending this shirt.,B0002MGM4O
Good shirt for fishing. Rugged and cleans up well. It is hot if no breeze is blowing. The fabric traps your body heat if it has no push to draw it out. Keeps the sunburn at bay.,B0002MGM4O
"Very nice! The color, the desing, very good quality!
I recommend this model. The size is big, not as other models with ""xxl"" size.",B0002MGM4O
"I have stocked up on a few of the Bahama II's recently. They are really light and allow heat to escape and fresh air to come in. These do run slightly larger than size, so they are nice and roomy. No brainer here other than which colors do you choose!",B0002MGM4O
"Perfect shirt for south Mississippi. Lightweight, and the mesh vent on the back helps to keep you cool. I have one in almost every color.",B0002MGM4O
my boyfriend loves the quality of this shirt. says its cool and soft. It looks good on the boat or going out on the town. I want one now.,B0002MGM4O
"I will be buying more of these. I really like the big pockets and the shirt feels so light and cool. Thank you.

 P.S. You can't go wrong buying this.",B0002MGM4O
"This shirt is perfect for all day outdoor activities. I ordered the black one, and even in the sun all day you still don't get hot.",B0002MGM4O
"So far, I love the shirt.  Sharp looking, and true to size.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars, is because I ran into another person wearing the exact same shirt at work.  One difference though.  It was pretty faded.  He even mentioned how mine must be pretty new.  So, I expect a similar future for mine.",B0002MGM4O
This is a very good shirt and I am glad that I ordered it for my husband for Father's Day.  He will love it.,B0002MGM4O
This was purchased for my husband.  He loves the comfort of these shirts.  The price was extremely reasonable for Columbia.,B0002MGM4O
"Well made, breathes easy.  Water rolls off of it as if off a duck's back.  Kept me cool and dry even In muggy weather.  I will be buying more of these in different colors.",B0002MGM4O
"Love this shirt and actually bought two but another color and they are nice for summer weather,  Great,  THanks.  Will probably buy more",B0002MGM4O
"nice cool shirt for the summer, and stylish I guess.  I like it because it is comfortable, and I love primary colors.
I bought 3 more in different colors.",B0002MGM4O
"I use this shirt on all my warm weather vacations and have several colors.  It is great for walking around sightseeing, fishing, at the beach, going from beach to lunch etc. It dries quickly,really  needs no ironing  and holds its color very well. I have been wearing these shirts for years and even some of my older ones are fairly color fast.  I enjoy the larger pockets, I enjoy it running large...it is not a fashion shirt folks, it is designed for fishing. I wear Xlarge in all my summer shirts, aloha shirts, camp shirts etc. They don't stick to the body, they circulate air well, they dry on me. Sometimes when it is really hot I wear a wicking shirt when I hike or sight see. Even though I have lost 30 lbs I still wear an XL. I really don't care if it looks a bit large on me...it is my comfort I am concerned about and not making a fashion statement with a fishing/outdoor shirt. I also have them in long sleeve for cool weather travel and they too are great. btw..I have worn them in Greece, Turkey, Hawaii, Bermuda, NOLA, Key West, heck all over in the heat and they are the only shirts, in my mind, to wear in the heat.",B0002MGM4O
Love these shirts. Only issue is the velcroe on pockets fails after a wash or two. Fix that issue and you have a five star shirt.,B0002MGM4O
"This is one of the best clothing purchases I've made in the past year.  Excellent 'Columbia"" quality and UV protection.  After washing it as per the garment directions, I hung it out for a few hours and it looked very good for not being ironed.",B0002MGM4O
Size is alittle of the larger fit type. No dramas as i wear them in hot asian humid climate with these.,B0002MGM4O
It is a nice shirt and I use it for fishing. However it wrinkles much more than other brands. Probably could be ironed if you wanted to.,B0002MGM4O
"What a great birthday present - just what he needed, and it matches his eyes! I think he'll enjoy wearing it.",B0002MGM4O
I now have 7 of these shirts (4 of them long sleeve). They are so comfortable and breathable. I use them for everything from fishing to going out for the night. Very fast drying and protective for all day in the sun.  I plan on getting some more.,B0002MGM4O
best shirt i have ever owned and the only shirt i ask my kids to get me for dads day,B0002MGM4O
"yes these....I have 4 of these shirts cause I look so good in them.  well I think i look good, so anyway that's all that matters",B0002MGM4O
"It is a very nice shirt, It's true to size on the shoulders but cut like a tent on the torso and waist. Nice shirt for CCW or if your very overweight.",B0002MGM4O
EXCELLENT PRODUCT. THATS THE PERFECT SIZE AND IT FITS PERFECTLY. I JUST LOVE COLUMBIA BRAND!,B0002MGM4O
I buy these shirts for my son and my husband. They both love these shirts so much that I find it hard to get them from them so I can wash them. They wash wonderful and come unwrinkled out of the dryer. Great colors!,B0002MGM4O
"Very nice shirts, the colors are perfect  I like to see more of this, also T-shirts and pants, please thanks",B0002MGM4O
I bought this for my husband as a casual shirt.  He loves it!  It very comfortable and looks great on.  The fit is true to size.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought a large, like I usually do with button up shirts. However, this large was more like an XL. But a size down if you want it to fit better.",B0002MGM4O
"excellent product, is what is asked both in size and color. My recommendation is that you introduce your product to the invoice to then have no problems with customs. This product has its tranking to trace the same and no customs problem.",B0002MGM4O
"No... seriously. This is the best shirt EVER! I bought one about a month ago and I've been buying another each week. I have five now. It's all I wear. They dry almost instantly and they don't change colors when they get wet with sweat. I'm posting this review as I'm buying shirts 6 and 7.

The only bad thing is the color choices. I wish they had more ""normal"" colors.",B0002MGM4O
I bought a couple of these shirts for my husband to fish in. Just the right weight and style. Would buy again.,B0002MGM4O
"I love these shirts I have several of them but I ordered a black one and recieved a blue one that was not at all like pictured, pockets, collar, vents were not as pictured.
I have since returned the shirt for a refund.",B0002MGM4O
"My husband and I both wear Columbia Bahama shirts all Summer and Amazon has a good selection of colors. Amazon is also very competitive in pricing..I just bought this Zing color for my husband who normally wears the whites and blues. He gets many complements when he wears the zing colored one.
They are very attractive comfortable shirts to wear fishing or just a good cool Summer shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"The shirts I ordered came in a timely manner and the fit perfect. I ordered a large and it was the right fit...the material is good
and the fit is good. All and all the shirts are very good and i would order them again.",B0002MGM4O
"Don't order unless you like bright yellow.  I thought it was too bright and returned it.  Otherwise, good quality.  Thanks",B0002MGM4O
I was very pleased with the look and fit of this shirt.  It looks like it will hold up well as it is washed over time.,B0002MGM4O
Wrinkle so bad that I don't use it very often.  I was looking for shirt with a better liner inside it,B0002MGM4O
Shirt is fantastic.  Will order more.  Material is great and he says it is very comfy.  Thanks alot!  GMa Lori,B0002MGM4O
"As other comments this shirt run Big, in my case a Large size fit well very well, will buy more in a close future",B0002MGM4O
LOVE THIS TOP! Cannot wait to wear it on our fishing trip! Love the color & feel to the shirt!,B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt! Well crafted, comfortable, with enough pockets to safeguard items. Colors are awesome; they go well with a number of color coded jeans and casual pants.",B0002MGM4O
"I ordered four of the large size of these shirts for general use in the sun. They probably would have performed OK, but the cut of the shirt is very large in the midsection, and I am not. This is not apparent in the picture. They are quite expensive, so I would want them to fit well. I returned all four.",B0002MGM4O
"I wish it didn't have the hoops and name on it.  Also, I took the buttons off the collar.  Great material and workmanship.",B0002MGM4O
"I love this shirt. It's durable, and great for a variety of uses! I wear mine fishing, at the beach, by the pool, and just lounging around. It's breathable - so you won't get hot wearing it! I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to be comfy!",B0002MGM4O
My husband loves Columbia shirts and especially loves that they are available in tall sizes.  These shirts are very cool and comfortable which is important to us as we recently traveled to Israel.,B0002MGM4O
Exactly what I expected and arrived when it was supposed to! The size was accurate and it's very comfortable.  You can not beat this price for the great quality.,B0002MGM4O
shirt works great in the hot weather but  one draw back is it comes out of the laundry wrinkled pretty bad.,B0002MGM4O
Got this shirt for our trip to Dominican Republic - it kept me very cool and was extremely light and comfortable for my big/tall size. It's not just for fishing--,B0002MGM4O
Buen Producto y buena atencion por parte del vendedor,B0002MGM4O
"Great product. I'm a sucker for Columbia clothes anyhow due. feels good, can use it for hiking or for social events as well. The only thing due is the size, Columbia sizes are running big, always buy one size smaller than you usually wear.",B0002MGM4O
"I buy Columbia shirts for my construction man, they are comfortable, breathable, and fit true to size and I do not have to iron them.  He also is an avid fisherman and hunter.  If he is not at work he is in the woods or out on the pond or lake.  After hundreds of washings, from wearing to work or play the color has not faded it has not shrunk.  I highly recommend this brand and style!",B0002MGM4O
"Definitely there's a reason why every man is talking about this brand, I got this shirt for my husband and he absolutely loved it, he says the fabric is so fresh and the fit is wonderful, he is a little overweight but this shirt looks great on him.",B0002MGM4O
It was my favorite color. It was what I really wanted to put my monogrammed initials on. I really appreciate this person/company,B0002MGM4O
"OOPPS I just wrote this review on another item that is similar and that item we were happy with.
This shirt is way to short for an active person.  All the reviews state buy a size smaller and we did.
the shirt is too short and we are disappointed.",B0002MGM4O
"Columbia Bahama11short sleeve shirt is perfect for my husband.  Yellow color is nice, bright and a good choice for spring/summer.  Outdoor walking and hiking provides ample pockets for carrying items. Comfortable, true medium size, nice button down collar and SPF factor.  We wouldn't buy any other brand. Columbia shirts are quality through and through.",B0002MGM4O
"The size of this shirt definitely runs on the large side (loose fit). I usually wear a large and based on other reviews I ordered a medium; I am glad I did because the medium is a PERFECT fit for me. The shirt is very light weight, but very durable. It makes packing for a long trip a breeze, because you can pack more shirts and still not have a heavy suitcase. The pockets on the front are deep and perfect for people that have a lot of things to carry with them. I highly recommend this shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"I like this shirt.  Good comfortable, casual shirt.  Expands well and allows movement.  Quality fabric and constructed well.  I recommend this shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"this shirts keep you cool, feel good on the body, they are comfortable, they look good. I really like them. I will buy more!",B0002MGM4O
This is a great shirt i definetly recomend it to the buyers. This shirt is very fresh and fits great.,B0002MGM4O
Husband loves it  light weight and breathable,B0002MGM4O
This shirt fits very well and is so comfortable to use on a day to day basis. Just took 4 of these to my vacation in Orlando in temperatures of 75 or so degree weather and these shirts performed nicely. I like de Tamiami model better it fits better and looks cleaner .Another good quality product from Columbia!!,B0002MGM4O
"A couple years ago, I bought about 5 of the PFG shirts because of the great breathable material. Quick dry. For some obscure reason, the current shirt material is light, but not as breathable.. I can't find that material in any of Columbia current offerings. Too bad.",B0002MGM4O
Perfect light weight Shirt for Men that like to wear the shirt out made sized giving room to move around.,B0002MGM4O
"Husband ordered a XLT (extra large tall) and while the shirt received is labeled XLT, compared to another Columbia XLT (Columbia Men's Silver Ridge Short Sleeve Shirt) this one has 6"" additional diameter - it's huge on him (he's more tall w/o the XL, but a prior Columbia Large just doesn't cut it).

I expect Columbia quality would have made this 4 or 5 stars, but the variation in size between styles is a pain.

BTW can anyone explain what 'Inseam' is doing in a shirt size:  ""Large, Tall Inseam""?",B0002MGM4O
"Beautiful color,great quality and the item was reasonably priced! I am pleased with my purchase. This will look nice this spring.",B0002MGM4O
"Fits 1 size smaller. But great fit after all. I'm a size M, but in Columbia i fit in a Size S.",B0002MGM4O
all well recommend 100% in good condition came to Venezuela was nice buying this new product without further ado thanks,B0002MGM4O
this shirt looks better in the picture than in real life. very thin material. nice design though. would not buy again.,B0002MGM4O
Bought this for the color and not at all disappointed.  Nice look and good ware.  The fabric hold up well.,B0002MGM4O
GIVEN AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT. HE REALLY LIKED THE COLOR AND WE LIVE IN THE SOUTH AND IT FITS WITH THE WEATHER. CAN BE USED AS DRESSY AND CASUAL.,B0002MGM4O
Love the complete Columbia brand. They are made overseas but in the hot humid weather of Florida is just what i need. Very durable and great choice of colors available.,B0002MGM4O
"I have a few of these shirts for fly fishing. Awesome for those hot days. Very comfortable. I purchased this color for vacationing in Mexico as they are cool and comfortable. They fit a bit big, which makes them the perfect size for me!!",B0002MGM4O
Husband likes these a lot. They are thin and cool and look nice. They are cooler fabric than the Drake shirts we tried. Will purchase again.,B0002MGM4O
My husband has a number of these shirts.  He says there are a lot of imitations but none can compare with the quality of Columbia.  Buy with confidence.,B0002MGM4O
"This T-shirt design is very good, I think it's time for summer wear will feel very cool, its high cost.",B0002MGM4O
This was bought as a gift and it was well received.  It seems to be well made and a good material.  Since I'm not wearing it I can't give it 5 stars.,B0002MGM4O
These are great shirts...cool and comfortable.  They resist stains (I spilled red wine on it and it blotted up without a trace) and wash up great.,B0002MGM4O
This product has fulfill my expectations and its quality is good.  I would recommend it to those who like Columbia clothing.,B0002MGM4O
"This is the second Columbia shirt product that I've purchased. The first was a long-sleeve design. As I suspected when I bought this short-sleeve Columbia design, it fits well, and it is very comfortable in both warm and cold weather.",B0002MGM4O
"It's perfect, except for even if it is X-Small it's still too big. Other than that, it is a great product.",B0002MGM4O
"If you are a bigger guy then you know all about the magic that is fishing shirts! These shirts do run big, but they fit so well. You can move and bend and it doesn't get tight. The Columbia brand specifically seems to be a GREAT brand on this shirt. I have had no trouble with shirts fading or buttons falling out.  What is also nice is that they are long so you can bend over without your lower back falling out.  Really a great product, but know that they run a little big. If you have experience with these shirts then you know all about it.",B0002MGM4O
"Item as expected. Color true to picture.  We were going to Isla Mujeras, Mexico.  Perfect for the warm weather and sunshine for my fair skinned husband. Shirt was comfortable and suitable for the resort dining areas, Lots of room to carry passport while traveling when needed,",B0002MGM4O
"but he takes what he calls a triple medium (xLarge) -- you have to think about it -- ''triple medium'' -- I ended up returning it and paying much more at a local store that was supposedly on a sale of 40% off, coming in at $20 more than Amazon. Then adding insult to injury, I picked one up at a thrift store for $1 that was in good condition.",B0002MGM4O
"From the box the shirt is very soft. I have machine washed mine several times now. No shrinkage, discoloring or loss of  its neat appearance. I like the fit so much I bought two more.",B0002MGM4O
"Bought it as a Xmas present for a family member. He is very happy with this shirt. True to size, nice color.",B0002MGM4O
"I take photo trips for 2 or 3 weeks at a time and dealing with clothing on top of my gear is a PITA. The Columbia Bahama helps me keep it simple: super lightweight and folds tiny, can be washed in hotel room sinks and dries fast. Plus it's comfortable, cool, not prone to wrinkles and rocks the safari look. I love the sage color but be forewarned it's similar to park ranger and zoo keeper attire. I was asked for park information a couple times while enjoying the California Redwoods! Next time around, I'll spring for the blue Bahama...

The workmanship of this made in Vietnam shirt is excellent but, as other reviewers noted, runs at least one size too large. I'm 5'8"" 140LBs with slim athletic build (biker/runner) and normally wear small. However, I bought extra small and it fits okay but is still oversized, sort of a 1980s tent shirt fit. I've been wearing Columbia jackets and shirts for years and most run a size large, so par for the course.

I live in the tropics and the sun burns me through my t-shirt within 30 minutes. UV protection is excellent and I'm good for hours of shooting without a hint of redness. As for coolness, it's okay but not much better than a normal light cotton shirt. The nylon fabric is more prone to abrasion than cotton shirts: Cordura bags and daypack straps tend to ""sand"" it if you walk around all day.

Finally, as a photographer I find the large pockets useful for holding filters, memory cards, lens caps, etc. The velcro makes for quick one-handed access and the pockets expand enough to hold a small lens. All in all a great shirt for photographers, travelers and outdoorsmen.",B0002MGM4O
"This product is made with a very good quality material and fit very well to me, I'm glad to make business with them",B0002MGM4O
Arrived on time and looked exactly like the picture. Gave it as a Christmas gift to my son-in-law and he loved it.,B0002MGM4O
"I usually wear a size XL or XXL,I ordered an xL .but it run too large for me .I was  swimming in this shirt.  It is light, cool, and is made very well. I like it very much. but I have decided to give it as a gift to a frend of mine who is a larger man.",B0002MGM4O
Is an excelent product so some large to me. I wear M size but this shirt is so large in my size. I recommend to latin people buy one menor size.,B0002MGM4O
"Gave these shirts to my son, son in law and grandsons in their 20's for Christmas. I puuchased different colors for each of them. Their ages spanned from age 25 to 60 and each of them were genuinely happy to have them. This shirt appeals to all ages, it washes well without wrinkles or need for ironing. All of the men proclaimed how much they love how comfortable this shirt is to wear in the hot weather.",B0002MGM4O
"I have purchased this shirt before in another color.  For some reason, this shirt runs large.  This is strange since I ordered the exact one in a different color before which fit fine.",B0002MGM4O
"This shirt is not only an awesome sports/fishing shirt, it is great in the desert. I have several - even one with my LSU Tigers logo on it! It is so comfortable, I wear it in the winter in the desert (VERY cold) and just wear my warm tactical coat over it until I enter my control post. If you don't own several, you should!",B0002MGM4O
These shirts run slightly a little big.  My husband usually wears a large in t shirts but in these shirts he needs a medium.  He was very excited to get this shirt.  Great price!  Great buy!,B0002MGM4O
My husband noticed this shirt on a family member and just had to have it!  The fit is perfect and it is very comfortable.,B0002MGM4O
I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday hoping the deal wasn't too good to be true. I got mine at 1/2 the price PFGs normally run for and he had no idea I bought it online.  He loves it and I will keep buying his PFGs through this company,B0002MGM4O
Is excelent. Superior from any point. Everything is done to be an excellent product. I have 6 in diferent colors and never looks like old. They seem to be new every moment. Do not hesitate to buy it.,B0002MGM4O
Will need a little ironing but a great looking shirt. Cool and comfortable in warm weather. Will wear it in the Bahamas,B0002MGM4O
"Fantastic fitting lightweight nylon shirt
Even a better price !

I am VERY Happy with this purchase !

In fact just bought three more colors !!!",B0002MGM4O
"Very nice shirt, it runs a bit bigger tan your normal size tough, so if you normally use a size M, u should pick a size S.",B0002MGM4O
"Great purchase so far, light and fresh as I expected. Kind of big for a Large size but I like it.",B0002MGM4O
I BOUGHT  SHIRTS ONE SIZE SMALLER AND FIT WELL.UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT A JACKET TO SIZE AND NOT USABLE FAR TO LARGE.,B0002MGM4O
Nice shirt from Columbia.  This model is their dry quick material.  It makes it lighter weight than some other Columbia shirts.,B0002MGM4O
I did not buy it for myself. The one I got it for just told me their size. It fit true true to size. And very comfortable he said.,B0002MGM4O
"If you are tall, this shirt is for you---I mean very, very tall.  My son is over six feet
and he said it came down low like a tunic and could not be tucked in.  Fine material and workmanship though.",B0002MGM4O
This shirt is the best light weight useful travel shirt that I own; I plan to buy another (different color).,B0002MGM4O
"Liked this shirt, same usual Columbia quality.
Stay away of Super Bonehead Classic Short Sleeve Shirt, those are terrible, wrinkle magnet",B0002MGM4O
"I own a few of these in different colors.  They are very light but durable.  They stand up to multiple washing an drought use better than any shirt I own.  The prices of these fluctuate all over the place so put the ones you want in your shopping cart and WAIT.  The price drop to the $20 range frequently.  A helluva lot cheaper than the local store ""sale"" price of $40.  ;-)",B0002MGM4O
I love these Columbia shirts for traveling.  They have very large pockets that I can put my passport and tickets in.,B0002MGM4O
"slightly large size, but I prefer it that way.  beautiful material and color.  look forward to wearing it in hot weather.",B0002MGM4O
Bought a cotton and polyester of same style.  The cotton one is a pain to iron and the polyester one is a bit flimsy. I like the nylon best.,B0002MGM4O
"Really nice shirt, cool, comfortable and the quality is excelent.  The only negative is that it was larger than expected.  At 6'2"" and 185 lbs. I normally wear size large.  Based on the fit, I'm sure I could have easily fit into a medium.",B0002MGM4O
"The size is totally out of American standards! This equates to a Large XLarge XXLarge almost. I already bought the Tommy, Polo, etc. U.S. and shirt size is much larger than those other brands.",B0002MGM4O
"I have purchased several of these shirts for my husband.  He originally wanted one for when he goes fishing. Then, I noticed that he was wearing it every weekend. I love that they look great and are wrinkle free. My only wish is that Columbia would make this and the long sleeve version in more colors. My husband has lost weight but still needs a 3xlt. The color selection for the tall sizes is rather limited. I guarantee that my husband would buy more of these shirts if there were more colors.",B0002MGM4O
"wonderful product.
very comfortable .light , prefect for the casual look.
I highly recommend an assortment of colors to round out your wardrobe.",B0002MGM4O
"Todo bien, solo que no le sirvi a mi esposo, es una talla M bastante grande. All right, just not served to my husband, is a pretty big M size.",B0002MGM4O
"I am 5'8"" 190 lbs and ordered a large shirt from columbia.  The shirt came in a little larger than the local store displays.  I don't know why really?  Could be that I lost weight or maybe, it's made that way.  I verified at the stores again and it was conclusive...my Amazon bought shirt was a bit bigger on the waist and sleeves.  Still, I will use this shirt for fishing on hot days and it surely beats paying the extra price at your local stores.",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt for the tropics or Florida.  You definitely stay cool and the SPF 30 protects the covered portions from the sun.,B0002MGM4O
"I really liked, is beautiful, the color is beatiful, the correct size, the brand I love, my husband really likes, good price, the offer is very good, thanks.",B0002MGM4O
"Comfortable, light, looks great.  Perfect shirt for Malaysian weather.  I would highly recommend this shirt for anyone but especially those who live in high temperature, high humidity climates.",B0002MGM4O
"Color is a little darker than anticipated, but my husband loves these shirts.  He has at least a dozen and some of the loaders ones are starting to show yard work appropriateness.  Got this for his birthday and he was a happy man.",B0002MGM4O
"Just like anything else Columbia puts out, this shirt is awesome.  lots of pockets to stow gear and vents to keep you cool.",B0002MGM4O
I really like it and enjoy this items. This is perfect purchase. So definitely I have to buy new one.,B0002MGM4O
"I have purchased 6 of these shirts and will purchase more.  I'm a ""big and tall"" guy.  The ""T"" for tall shirts are much longer than most others, whcih I really like",B0002MGM4O
"Nice looking shirt, but was way too big for me.  I ordered the large.  I am 5' 11"" and 185 pounds.",B0002MGM4O
"Love this shirt so comfortable, and light.  Bought 3 of them, living on Okinawa Japan it can get hot and muggy but this works great.  Bought XL and was a little to large but I like loose fitting clothes.",B0002MGM4O
"Love it. Fits right, no problems getting it, NOT a second. People like purple. I AM enjoying the shirt. Get you one.",B0002MGM4O
"The material on this shirt is slightly heavier guage than most columbia PFG shirts I have purchased. I prefer the other, lighter materials.  I am happy with this shirt because the price under 20 dollars was exceptional value.",B0002MGM4O
"I must thank all the other reviewers for warning that this shirt fits large. I bought a size down from my usual and it fit well.
The Bahama shirt looks and fit very similar to the Bonehead and the Tamiami. However, the material for all 3 shirts are rather different. The Bonehead is cotton, the Bahama and the Tamiami are both synthetic type material which have different UV protection abilities. I must say that I like the Tamiami as it offers the best UV protection and has the nicest fabric of the 3. But this is subjective and many would prefer cotton. The Bahama has a different pocket deign from the Tamiami and again I personally prefer the Tamiami.
It is a good shirt however and Amazon offers a pretty competitive price for it. Happy overall with it.",B0002MGM4O
"Keeps its shape and stays nice looking...will buy more as time passes and sales return.
Not sure how well the ""keep cool"" panel in the back works yet but I will check it out and give updated feedback.",B0002MGM4O
Just what I expected for the price. Good quality. I would buy another If needed. Looking for other unique items.,B0002MGM4O
"Very large shirt, I thought it was smaller, and usually buy shirts that size and fits very well ... I could not use for that ...",B0002MGM4O
Looks great and is super breathable. I love the color too. It's still orange but it's not too much. Buy one!,B0002MGM4O
"Size fits a little smaller than what I'm use too but I'll deal with it, I really like the shirt.",B0002MGM4O
I love the style of this shirt. the fabric also breathes which it great. my husband normally wears a large shirt but after the reviews we decided on a medium. I think the small would have been better for him as it is a little big still.,B0002MGM4O
"I use this as a beach shirt. It keeps the sun from scorching my Irish skin, and I wear it in the water! It dries pretty quickly! I have owned these Columbia shirts in the past and have loved each one!",B0002MGM4O
"The fabric of the Columbia fishing shirts keep improving over time. I look in my closet at the early ones that wrinkle like cotton, which were followed by wrinkle-free shirts that were hard to keep tucked in or rolled up on the sleeves, and then look at this one that is wrinkle-resistant, comfortable, and isn't slippery. Bravo! Mostly I don't care about how they look...all of them dry quickly in the elements and stay cooler in the hot sun than other fishing shirts I own.",B0002MGM4O
I have bought this shirt because of the material fast drying and comfortable to wear would recommend this shirt to anyone.,B0002MGM4O
"Love the shirt, love the color, very comfortable.  Just what I expected.  Get loads of compliments when I wear it.",B0002MGM4O
"The first time I wore the shirt was on a hot day.  It seemed VERY hot and did not provide the cooling from evaporation I expected.  Will the shirt breath & be cooler after washing??  I have an older long sleeve similar shirt & it seems to be much cooler.

Overall I liked the style, cut, features, & fit of the shirt.

Mac",B0002MGM4O
"I really like this shirt as it is light weight (great for the hot summer), airy, comfortable and fits nice.",B0002MGM4O
"This item is huge and i guess a guy needing an XL size should be wearing an L or an M , do keep in mind that the shirt is extremely loose can not be altered due to the fabric but has an amazing finish and is extremely light and comfortable.",B0002MGM4O
Purchased these shirts for the whole family.  We already had some and loved them.  Nice and light for fishing and cruising.,B0002MGM4O
"We just moved to Florida from Washington State so the weather is oppressively hot.  My husband works out side a lot and noticed a number of men wearing these shirts.  We purchased a couple and he loved them so I jumped on Amazon and ordered a couple more (cheaper than the local store.)

Highly recommend!",B0002MGM4O
"Liked my original so much, I bought one for my brother and step father.  Light weight, resists water, dries fast.  Broke mine in sailing in Florida with plenty of sun  and spray. Pockets well designed and functional  nice color selection.",B0002MGM4O
"This is way too large - the michelin man would have no issues fitting inside it.
- Strange as Columbia's other clothes fit me fine.
The material is also a lot denser/warmer than the Tamiami II - look at this shirt instead for warm weather and good fit.",B0002MGM4O
"I bought this for my husband and he likes it.  Very cool shirt to wear in hot weather - back yoke has ventilation.  Nice fit and love the olive color!  a great gift for your husband, boyfriend or relative.  Very well made.  I will have to buy more in different colors!",B0002MGM4O
I'm glad that I read the previous reviews because the sizing does run large.  I usually wear a 3XLT so I ordered a 2X and it fit perfectly.  I wore this while on vacation in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park while hiking in 100 degree plus temps.  This not only kept me cooler than a regular shirt but also dried quickly when the sweat was pouring.  Overall a great shirt and a great price.  I will be getting more of these.,B0002MGM4O
"This is the third one I have bought for my husband.  They do run a little large.  He typically wears an XL, but in this shirt he wears an L.",B0002MGM4O
This is the shirt to buy for the high heat & humidity. It is the shirt to have try to believe.,B0002MGM4O
"Sad thing is, would love to buy other colors of this shirt, but different pricing, much higher, wish that was not the case!!!",B0002MGM4O
"Shirt has a good feel, would have been a 5 star if it had a pen hole in the pocket.",B0002MGM4O
"These are a must in humid climates. I ordered some long sleeve ones too. There are lots of pockets on the chest so it ""looks"" very much so like a fishing shirt. If that is okay, then you are fine.  Columbia makes some others that have less or different pocket style.  My Tamiami II long sleeve one has better pocket designs.  Color is a big factor in cost which is weird, but price can vary as much as $10-12 per shirt based on color despite Amazon being the seller.",B0002MGM4O
"I ordered this shirt for a cruise vacation and found the size to be much larger than expected.  If you typically order shirts in the x-large size, I would go with a large size here.",B0002MGM4O
"Nice material, great fit, cool, just needs a light press after laundering. Looks great on my husband and have seen several other men with the same shirt in Florida.",B0002MGM4O
These shirts are well-known and for good reason.  They are light and comfortable dry or wet.  I don't use mine in a true outdoors fashion.  I think the sewing may not be robust enough to stand up to a load that fits in all the pockets.  Opposed to an Oxford shirt this is a nice statement shirt and very comfortable.,B0002MGM4O
"Being 6'4"" 205lbs I went to bass pro to try this shirt on prior to buying it. Medium was too short and large is a little wide at the shoulders. It's an excellent shirt but they definitely have their own size guide. Suggest trying on a shirt first to know your size",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt for the spring and summer!!! The material is great and it gives a natural look without having that ""heavy starch"" look! I feel very relaxed and enjoy the ventilation this shirt gives. I purchased six other shirts to give my summer wardrobe a makeover...highly recommended!!!",B0002MGM4O
"I was very happy with all three shirts and I must have machine washed several times since I bought them. All my Columbia shirts I bought together are fine except for this one. The last time I washed it two days ago, the two upper buttons were missing, evidently came off during the wash. I can not saw buttons too well and I can not wear it like this. I am disappointed and felt short changed by the poor quality control.",B0002MGM4O
"I purchased these for my son and he absolutely loved them.  The sleeves are a bit large but my son says they are more comfortable this way, so my son and I give them thumbs up!",B0002MGM4O
And I mean that literally - this shirt is my favorite shirt to wear when it's hot. It breathes beautifully and is very lightweight. I owned one for over a year and bought this one because I like it so much.,B0002MGM4O
This shirt fits and looks good but it doesn't breathe! It is HOT HOT HOT! It's humid where I live and it sticks to me.,B0002MGM4O
"Everybody needs to own a few of these. Fir size reference, I am 6' tall, 190lbs and ordered a medium and it fits perfectly (not tight but loose and comfortable).",B0002MGM4O
"Wish I had paid attention to other comments. We reordered a size smaller for my husband. Otherwise, a great shirt!",B0002MGM4O
I used the shirt for the first time on a trip to South East Asia and it was a great relief.,B0002MGM4O
I do love this shirt but they do run large.  Very roomy and comfortable.  Casual but can be worn to a decent restaurant.,B0002MGM4O
"My husband really likes this shirt that I ordered for him from Amazon.com.  It fits perfectly, the material is good, the color looks charming on him and it has all the ""boy accoutrements"" that he loves in a shirt.  Perfect!",B0002MGM4O
Great shirt at a great price. Very well made and plenty of pockets for storage. This shirt is great for travel and keeps you cool in hot weather.  Dries very fast plus plenty of colors to choose from.,B0002MGM4O
My husband is very hard to please but he loved this shirt. I also love it as we'll because it is very easy to wash and dry.,B0002MGM4O
"Columbia have the perfect fabric for the summer which breathes and the shirt is perfect for travelling with pockets and hooks to make your holiday and camping easier.

This is my 3rd shirt.",B0002MGM4O
I bought these shirts for my husband and son for a camping and fishing trip.  They came home raving about these shirts!!!! My son even got fish blood with his first catch and wet it with the lake water.... they said it came right out!!!! Also they got caught in rain and the shirt dried in no time!  It helped keep them cool out in the hot aluminum boat!  I will definitely buy more!!!!!,B0002MGM4O
Comfortable shirt for warm weather and great looking.  It can be worn many times before needing washing.  I wear it to work and play.,B0002MGM4O
"Color was nice and bright without being gaudy.
Fit was good, husband loves this style.
Only negative thing I found was this particular shirt for some reason comes out very wrinkly!  Not sure why, same shirt different color does not, obviously something is different .
Overall happy with the purchase",B0002MGM4O
These shirt has lived up to expectations and I do not even fish.  I could not have asked for more as this is a perfect shirt for being able to look nice and still be out in the heat.,B0002MGM4O
"The shirt is fine just a little large even when I ordered the smallest size

La camisa est bien un poco grande, aun cuando ped el tamao ms pequeo.",B0002MGM4O
This shirt is really hot in sun its better open with a tank top and sizes run a little to big,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt. Great price. Can't beat Columbia quality. The sizes of these shirts are huge. I have several other brands of fishing shirts in xtra large so I ordered this one in xl as well. It is huge. I could have easily worn a large. Something to consider when ordering.,B0002MGM4O
"the best pants that I've tried, I'm great without complaint, the best brand, the best fabric, good any thing. i liked",B0002MGM4O
"fits better than the copy cat products such as the ones in walmart, academy sports. I would highly recommend this product.",B0002MGM4O
I recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought it is as expected buy a recomend them,B0002MGM4O
I recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought it is as expected buy a recomend them,B0002MGM4O
"This shirt is the best product I have ever purchased. And I must say, it looks great on me. Fantastic is the word",B0002MGM4O
"Medium, my regular size, was way to big, returned it for a small and it fit perfect. Liked it so much I ordered 2 more of different color,",B0002MGM4O
"I have bought a lot of shirts, size large.  I'm not chubby but fit and it's common for the large size shirt to be a bit large in the belly and chest.  These are freaking HUGE.  My girl friend and I could both fit inside these things.  Oddly, I have a Columbia Bahama shirt that fits, but it's about 15 years old.  I guess a large is now almost a XXL.  Now I have to jump through hoops to return these things.",B0002MGM4O
"The shirt is of good quality, but something I do not understand, my first shirt size L Columbia's pedi, I'm great, then another model pedi size M and even feel great, third shirt that my father buy pedi S and I have no, strange situation.",B0002MGM4O
PEFECT GIFT. HE LOVED IT!!!!!  COLOR WAS WONDERFUL. EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING!! I WOULD FOR SURE BUY FROM THIS SELLER ONCE AGAIN.,B0002MGM4O
Columbia it's a great brand and super comfortable fit me right on the spot I would by again the product i'm very happy.,B0002MGM4O
This is a nice shirt as i have it in other colors however it arrived with a broken button so i can only give it 1 star,B0002MGM4O
I couldn't wait to get this. I had never seen a black fishing shirt like this and black is my favorite color so I had been on the look out for one. I heeded the advice that they run big and ordered a size smaller. It's still big but I can live with it. I went with the cheaper blemished type shirt. I could not find a thing that would have relegated it to that category. I am delighted.,B0002MGM4O
"I own two of these now (different colors) and I love it.

It's a great shirt for living in hot climate. The vent in the back is a life saver.

I want more of these shirts!",B0002MGM4O
I found this glider at a condo I was staying at.  I had to have one. I love it.  I am 6 foot tall.  Nice for a tall man.,B0002MGM4O
I could literally wear this shirt every day of the week. Very nice! Dries fast and fits well.  The shirt dries within minutes of getting out of the river.,B0002MGM4O
"These run big, i bought one for my dad, his usual size is xxl but it was way too big. I returned it and got an xl, which fits a little big but works wells.",B0002MGM4O
This is an excellent shirt. I am outside 8-10 hrs a day during Spring and Summer. I like this shirt because it is very cool. T-shirts are too hot for me sometimes. This shirt will keep yo cool.,B0002MGM4O
"Great for travel. Stays sharp looking. Very comfortable. I liked it so much, I bought another. I recommend this shirt highly.",B0002MGM4O
I bought this shirt for my husband for his May birthday . It's an addition to the  many Columbia PFG shirts he wears all summer long.,B0002MGM4O
"nice shirt for fishing or just taking a hike , very cool to wear , looks great , buy this shirt you won,t be disappointed",B0002MGM4O
"When the summer time rolls around, I get to being a pretty sweaty guy. Whether it's yardwork outside, going to concerts in the heat, or even going out to the lake in the midst of summer heat, this shirt just manages to keep me cool and comfortable. I think I'll be buying more of these and even if PFG stands for Performance Fishing Gear, know that you don't have to be a fisherman to get the most out of these shirts!",B0002MGM4O
I got this for my son who wears XL shirts in every brand.  This is huge and I can wear it and I'm an XXL.,B0002MGM4O
The weather here in Dallas is about to go into triple digit so I can use the help with the heat.  Sturdy too.  Nice pockets.,B0002MGM4O
"I bought a couple of these shirts before heading to the Caribbean, and I am thankful I did. They are super light, and breathe easily. A perk of the shirt is that is dries rapidly. It has plenty of pockets, and is a very functional shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"What can i say, it's a Columbia product. Well made, super comfortable, rugged, and well worth the money. it won't be my last.",B0002MGM4O
"Fits great and construction is fantastic.  This should last a while, and be nice and comfortable.  Couldn't ask for anything better.",B0002MGM4O
"very nice shirt, but runs quite large.  I am just into XL after losing some weight, and this shirt fits like my old XXL's",B0002MGM4O
"Bought this for my 20 year old son to wear for fishing at the lake, and it fits great, lightweight.  He totally loves it...wants more!",B0002MGM4O
"Bought this for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it. Perfect fit! Quality material! Very nice color, as well. Highly recommend this brand.",B0002MGM4O
I love these shirts I have quite a few of them and I love the fit and feel of them much better then the bargain brands that try to duplicate the Columbia products. It arrived when promised and the price was great and I will recommend this short to anyone that asks me about them!!,B0002MGM4O
When i buy this shirt don't know the incredible and confortable are; now i know and recomended for all people,B0002MGM4O
"PROS:

It's kinda baggy which I love, the cuts on the back make it a perfect match for a hot summer day. The fabric is pretty awesome since it's neither hot nor cold.

CONS:

It kinda snags on everything so if you have pets better watch out because this attracts everything (specially hair) like there's no tomorrow.

Bottom line it is an excellent shirt, I simply love it.",B0002MGM4O
Exact fit...great material and nice looks. It was amazing the stain resistance.....I was eating and spilled my soup but it slipped over the fabric and no stain to my shirt......cool!!!!,B0002MGM4O
I have three of these shirts now and really like them. Plenty of pockets to put glasses and other items. Easily accessible. Cool during the hot summer months. Great product.,B0002MGM4O
"Excellent shirts recommend them and they are much cheaper than in the shops, do not think there best price value relationship",B0002MGM4O
"My husband loves this shirt.  It's comfortable, attractive, and the color can be matched with several different pairs of pants.  It washes well & requires minimal to no ironing.  The sale price was a deal for the quality of the shirt.",B0002MGM4O
"My husband has wanted one of these shirts forever but everywhere else wanted 3 times the price. He says it's the most
comfortable shirt he has ever owned.  It's so comfortable in hot weather.  It's water resistant and launders beautifully.  He just
ordered two more.",B0002MGM4O
"I buy these shirts for my husband every year and I am thrilled to find them on Amazon! First, I want to let you all know that these do run a size larger. My husband normally wears an extra large so I purchase these in a large and they're perfect. The shirts wash well and do not shrink. While I will say that you need to take them straight out of the dryer when they are dry as they are prone to wrinkle, there are so many greater qualities that makes me not care if I have to iron them! They have a mesh fabric under the back flap of the shirt that allows heat to escape so these shirts are so cool in hot weather. Rain rolls right off of them and you never see sweat. Anyone who works out in the field absolutely would benefit by purchasing one for every day of the week! These are sharp and handsome looking shirts that come in a big variety of colors that do not fade. Amazon needs to put my husband on commission because now all the guys that work with him buy them. I just put two more in my cart!

I HIGHLY recommend these awesome shirts and I thank Amazon for carrying them as they are much cheaper here than in the Sports Stores! You can't go wrong and they are addicting!",B0002MGM4O
"He bought it for a fishing trip, but fell in love with this product, is so fresh, here in the caribbean with the humidity and all is the perfect fabric.",B0002MGM4O
"The shirt it's self  is well constructed. The stitching is strong and the cuts and contours are in the ideal locations allowing for full,range of movement without feeling like its pulling or tight, like under the arms whe stretching or reaching.
The venting is fantastic ad does help with overall cooling.
The ONLY drawback to this shirt is that it is way WAY t big for me.
I'm not a small guy, but not a manatee either. I'm 6' and weigh 190 lbs and I am swimming in the large, to the point that I gave it away to one of my fat friends and when he tried it on it even looked big on him and he is about 2 of me!

I don't know what kind of people run Columbia sportswear but they must be giants in stature.

My opinion of the shirt sands however. I liked it so much (despite the fact that it came as a tent, hahaha) that I ordered another on, only this time in a medium s I can keep it.",B0002MGM4O
"The product is great but the sizes are over sized, regularly I use XL on all my shirts but this one was too big.
I am from outside the united states so exchange this shirts for a smaller size is a bit of a problem to me :(

Thanks.",B0002MGM4O
"bought the shirt to use while fishing, though its still too cold out to try it out. don't see why it wouldnt be a good shirt though.",B0002MGM4O
"Great shirt. Original style, a lot of breathing elements. I order the Columbia regularly, but this shirt are larger than usual, ordered to a size smaller.",B0002MGM4O
"I found these exploring the net and saw that they were $10 less than store price.  I tied them and they are the same shirts that I own, fit correctly, and will buy more when I need them. (I have 15 of them!)",B0002MGM4O
"Light, splashproof almost waterproof, dry right the way, cool free feeling. easy acceptable pockets
Recommend for hot outdoor weather, specially on a water",B0002MGM4O
I agree with the product because is in fact the product that i bought i love this product and the responsability of the store,B0002MGM4O
"This brand is just comfy, I like the way it fits the male body and how fresh it is, not only in style, but comfort and you can wear it almost in every daily scenario",B0002MGM4O
"me gusto por que la media era la exacta
estaba a buen precio
era como lo especificado x el vendedor
llego a tiempo
me gusto el color
lo recomendare",B0002MGM4O
The shirt is M size?Eh?I can't believe it. I think it should be wear by Giant man. Another puma coat of M size I bought at the same time is suit for me very well.,B0002MGM4O
I looked at the shirt at two other retail/mail order I have bought from in the past. They were at least $10 higher. This shirt is NOT a lower quality imitation,B0002MGM4O
"La camisa manga corta Columbia, es muy suave y comoda. Ideal para estar expuesto a ambientes de clima cambiante, sol, calor y para practicar la pesca. Excelente producto.",B0002MGM4O
"Run's a little big...I'm an XL on every shirt I wear...and this felt like a XXL. It's still fine and I'm wearing it, but had I bought this in a store in person I would have went down a size.",B0002MGM4O
"I have had some columbia shirts before, still in use as of today, and this one just comes to support the summer hot climates",B0002MGM4O

"What can I say, excellent quality materials, comfortable, durable, light and functional but what the heck is Columbia thinking. I hope that they principle is due to some functional requirement for fishing for arm movement or something that requires these shirts to be so big, like 2 sizes bigger. I bought an XL as I usually take XL this thing is like a bed spread on me or a table cloth it is super large. I like these shirts so next time I will buy a Medium!",B0002MGM4O

"I bought this shirt for my husband to take on a long European vacation.  It is lightweight, cool, and has lots of pockets (which he loves).  Unfortunately, it was designed by a tentmaker.  My husband wears a large in every shirt but THIS large would have fit two of him.  It was like an extremely baggy dress.  It seemed like a nice shirt but we didn't have time before the trip to return it and try other sizes.  I think he would have worn a small and he's not a small man.",B0002MGM4O
"The moment we received this shirt, my husband put it on.  He loves it.  I was hoping it would be a bit more wrinkle friendly but what the heck, if he's happy, I'm happy.  Thanks Amazon.",B0002MGM4O

"I am very happy with the shirt that I purchased.  I have several others, and a white one was on my list.  It fits the bill.  Enjoy the feel of the material on my skin.",B0002MGM4O
"Columbia has great clothes but this shirt is designed huge in comparison to other similar shirts (EG LL Bean Tropicware(R) Shirt).  Maybe the Columbia designers think Americans who are in the market for their shirts are double portly or want rapper style. Fortunately, LL Bean still designs for athletic people who want a shirt that is loose but not tent like.  B/C I have a 38 chest, I wear a Small LL Bean and it fits great.  I can't order a size smaller from Columbia b/c there are no sizes smaller than small!  Columbia still has better color selection, so if not for the design flaw, I would choose Columbia and it would probably earn 5 stars.",B0002MGM4O
The shirt is of excellent quality. arrived at the time who said they would come. Buy it again but in a different color. I recommend it.,B0002MGM4O
This shirt proves to be very cool and comfortable. The pockets are plenty deep and there are hoops for (e.g.) sun glasses and one for a pen or pencil.,B0002MGM4O
"This shirt will show no sweat marks.  Sizes big, almost 1-size too big.  I normally wear a 2x but this sizes out near a 3x, almost 4x.

If you watch Survivor, you'll recognize this shirt as this line is often worn by Probst.",B0002MGM4O
"This is not ocean blue, it looks like dark turquoise or perhaps aquamarine,  there is too much green in it to be ocean blue.  It is not what is pictured.  On the other hand, I've never had a SPF 30 shirt before, so maybe there's something to that.  It fits and looks great.  I'll keep this one but remember not to buy from them again.",B0002MGM4O
"I bought this shirt as gift for my father, and he really liked it, it is true to size and very comfortable. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",B0002MGM4O

"I was looking for a light-weight, quick-drying, sun-protective shirt for my husband for a trip to Africa.  The cost of ""safari"" shirts was outrageous.  This ""fishing"" shirt had all the advantages at a fraction of the price.  The only reason a gave it a 4-star instead of a 5-star is some quality problems.  The buttonholes are not completely cut open.  I had to pull out my seam ripper and finish cutting them to get the buttons through.  It's fixable, it doesn't detract from the shirt after I made the fix, but I would appreciate a little better quality work on the shirt.",B0002MGM4O
This was a Christmas gift and the receiver has given rave reviews.  He likes the style and color as well as the fabric which is light and airy--great for warm weather.  I think I detect a hint for more of the same in other colors!!,B0002MGM4O

"This is my 3rd Columbia shirt that shares several similar features. If you get caught in a downpour, and soaked, don't worry. Take shelter, and this shirt will be totally dry in 10 minutes!
Click on the different colors to see a price differential. Great for casual wear, fishing, etc., and very well made.",B0002MGM4O
"The shirt is very well made and comes in a heap of colors. My one problem is that the vents on the back are massive and look tremendously goofy. They do keep you cool, no doubt, but it's not really a great look. I wish they were a bit more subtle.",B0002MGM4O
"My husband wears a large in any brand I've shopped at all major stores, however he was swimming in this shirt.  It is light, cool, and is made very well so I gave it 4 stars.  Just beware to buy one size down for a good fit.  The shirt is so nice that we have decided to give it as a gift to family member who is a larger man for Christmas.",B0002MGM4O
"I like Columbia Shirts, i wear them every day, it looks great with jeans. very comfortable, lightweight and nice looking.",B0002MGM4O

"My husband is a horticulturist and works under the sunshine and in the elements inherent on a nursery. Unfortunately he also has a history of skin cancer from his decades in the plant industry, wind surfing and sailing. When I learned about these Columbia shirts with 30 SPF and protection against both UV rays, I bought two of these moderately priced shirts for him to test. After the first day in his new shirt, he bragged about how much he loved it; I immediately ordered four more! Thanks Amazon -- couldn't find it anywhere else at such a great price!",B0002MGM4O
The Columbia fishing shirt is as good as can be bought. Cool in the summer sun and dries quickly when wet.,B0002MGM4O

"Bought this for my dad who wears an XL, it was way too big. Fit my husband who wears a 3x normally",B0002MGM4O
Shirt is much bigger than expected,B0002MGM4O
Great shirt . If you are an XLT like me you want this size. A normal XL doesn't come close to the same fit. My arms are 36 and I'm 6ft 3 3/4,B0002MGM4O
Beautiful color but unfortunately this shirt is so much larger then other shirts by Columbia in the same size. Great color but I had to return.,B0002MGM4O
"I like this gown so much I keep at least 4 of them.  When one wears out, I order another one.  They are very comfortable; if no one but me is home, I sometimes keep my gown on all day.  But they do run a bit large; you might want to order a smaller size than you usually wear.",B0002MGB9K
"Nothing else like it on the market that I know of.  I have osteoarthritis in my back.  I use this with satin sheets and sleep much better because it is so easy to turn and roll over.  It is thin and slinky, but substantial and not see-through.  Good quality.  This is my third order.",B0002MGB9K

"I have one in blue which washes nicely, no need to iron, so I purchased one in purple.  Extremely comfortable to sleep I a d they look good, no scratching like a few of my more expensive night gowns with lace.",B0002MGB9K
Bought for a gift.  Very disappointed as the hem came out on the first wash.  Embarrassing!  Not happy with this purchase.  Quality control must have been out to lunch on this one.  Kept to give as gift so now they won't even let me return it.,B0002MGB9K
it was rather small and it looked cheap when I received it.  I would have never have bought it if I had seen it in person first.,B0002MGB9K

"Love these nightgowns, they seem to last forever",B0002MGB9K
"I LOVE these nighties!  Soft oh...so soft, not to thin, the best I have EVER bought!  I bought two navy and turquoise and am going to order a third.  The petals are NOT scratchy, the flutter sleeves are the perfect length and this gown is not to full.  These are best gowns I have ever gotten!  Wash beautifully!  The length is also just right!",B0002MGB9K
"I like Shadowline gowns because the fit is good, and you cannot see through them.",B0002MGB9K

I love the Shadowline nightgowns. They are made with a great deal of quality and the material is neither too thin nor thick. I have several of these nightgowns.,B0002MGB9K
"I bought this as a Wendy Darling costume to run the Disney Marathon in. I tied a blue sash around my waist, some blue ribbon in my hair and it worked fairly well. The material was comfortable and didn't chafe (I wore a sports bra and running shorts under). It was quite a humid day so I was fine as it breathed well.",B0002MGB9K
"I  have 2 old nightgowns just like it, 26 years old.  They are finally wearing out, so I replaced one of them.  It is the only kind of nightgown I will ever buy.",B0002MGB9K

I fell in love with with Shadowline products and have bought them every since 1959.
I have never been disappointed in  shadowline products.",B0002MGB9K
"My wife loves these nightgowns... they are very soft and great to sleep in. The ""petal"" detail around the neckline is a nice touch and not scratchy as some other reviews suggest. If you like a roomy fit then order your normal size as they do seem to run a bit large.",B0002MGB9K
"Amazing quality. Bought two years ago, not a stitch went loose, no holes, no run-ups, good as new! Wearing almost every day, or every other day- for 2 years. In summer, feels nice and cool.",B0002MGB9K

Just right for my 88 yr old mom.  Looks just like picture.  Washes up well.  Very satisfied!,B0002MGB9K

"Will be ordering another one, my new favorite nightgown, fits beautifully and the color is fabulous! I ordered another brand with short sleeves, I liked it at first, but it kept getting tangled under my arms, a tight feeling. That's a deal breaker for me. I saw this one, so glad I ordered it. Very happy with my purchase, maybe a tad spendy, but worth it.",B0002MGB9K
great gown nice and soft i alson have this on in the long gown also i have thrown away al my men pajamas and only sleep in sof silky pink nightgowns and my wife loves it.,B0002MGB9K
"Through the years, I've purchased many of Shadowline's Women's Petals gowns in the long length.  They've been my favorite of all other gowns.  I wanted something shorter, so I ordered two of these.  My ISSUE: The fabric is not the same as the longer length!!!  The fabric is too thin.  I am able to wear them on hot, summer nights, but I had hoped to wear them year-round.  I hope that Shadowline will begin making the short version of Petals with the same, quality fabric as the original long ones.  PLEASE, SHADOWLINE, hear my plea !!!",B0002MGB9K
This was for my mom. She is happy with it and said it fjits fine. We were afraid a small would be too small so we got a medium.,B0002MGB9K

Was a gift.  Greatly appreciated.,B0002MGB9K
"Colorfast and cool for sleeping, size is right.",B0002MGB9K
"I bought them as presents, reasonably priced and are comfortable to travel!",B0002MGB9K
"Fits my mother great. Thicker material,  can't see through it.  She love it.  Very comfortable.",B0002MGB9K
Wife loves it.  Fit is good and the color is very attractive,B0002MGB9K
love Shadowline. so nice for summer,B0002MGB9K
This gown is so comfortable and feminine.  The length is just right falling just below the knee and plenty of fullness for comfort.  the stitching on the signature Shadowline roses at the neckline is beautifully done. No threads ends visible.  The embroidery does not shrink with laundering and stays as pretty years later as when it was new.,B0002MGB9K
"really worth the price, soft and cool.",B0002MGB9K
I looked for days to find this gown for my 92 year old mother-in-law.  This is the only kind she will wear.,B0002MGB9K
My wife has enjoyed the fit of shadowline products all of her life.  For the summertime when the temperatures are warmer she found these to be excellent.,B0002MGB9K
Beautiful quality and nice color.,B0002MGB9K
Always as expected - one of the few consistent products these days.,B0002MGB9K
"My wife received one of these gowns for her Mother's day gift , and she liked it so much that she had me order two more.  She said it was just what she had wanted.",B0002MGB9K
I liked it but now into PJs rather than gowns,B0002MGB9K
"This fit perfectly (the small is actually small and not too long either, especially for a short tiny person ^_^ ) and the neck isn't too wide wither, which has been odd, because most have had an extra large neckline but this one fits just right ^_^ my only grumble and this has been standard on most clothing, is that the tags are put right at the neckline so cut them out, and the stitching around the top portion is a bit on the thick side too. Great for assuring that the stitching holds but, it seems like it could have been done in such a way as to make it flatter, so it doesn't protrude out from the gown itself so much.

Minor flaws though, because they can easily be cut out. Worth it though for such a pretty, soft gown ^_^",B0002MGB9K
"THIS PRODUCT WAS A WONDERFUL SURPRIZE.  GREAT FIT,PLEASING LENGTH, AND C OMFY!!",B0002MGB9K
"I love this gown, I have 3 of them. Very soft and very comfortable",B0002MGB9K
For my grandma and she was so happy it was easy to put on,B0002MGB9K
"It is just a little big large, nothing too uncomfortable",B0002MGB9K
Hospital blue nightgown.  These just came in the mail so I can't attest to their long-term durability.  I purchased both a blue and purple.  They are about as shapely and  alluring as a hospital gown until you walk into bright light.  Then they are nearly invisible.  I don't recommend walking around the house in these unless you don't mind anyone seeing whatever you have (don't have) on underneath.  I will say that they are very light-weight and feel good.  They will likely make nice summer nighties.  I'm wondering if they will hang a little nicer after a wash.  I will update my review if that is the case.,B0002MGB9K
"Love the color and style, but a medium is more like a large or extra large.",B0002MGB9K
Purchased for my 80 + year old Mom.  It fit perfect and is exactly what she wanted.  Loved the color!,B0002MGB9K
"It was a gift and receiver said she loved it, said it was very soft and comfortable and fit just right.",B0002MGB9K
My wife loves the Shadowing gowns. She has worn them for years. It's nice to see Amazon has there line of gowns. The best part is there at Great prices.,B0002MGB9K
"This gift was well received. I wish these gowns weren't so pricey, ""they are not all that.""",B0002MGB9K
Nice but wayyyy too large.  I ordered large and sent it back for a medium and it is also too big but I won't return it.  Will give it away.  :(,B0002MGB9K
I was so happy to find the Shadow Line Sleepwear again.  I truly love my gown and the Blue is just stunning.  I also ordered a house coat that is just as lovely.  I will be purchasing more of these in the future.  Would love to have one of every color! :),B0002MGB9K
"great gown  and fit, the only ones I wear are shadowline, a little too expensive but never wear out",B0002MGB9K
great fit - great style. wash and wears well..,B0002MGB9K
"This gown is so pretty and so comfortable, you never want to take it off.  The red flowered neckline against the black make it simply irresistible.  Love it.",B0002MGB9K
Amazing! My mom loves this brand and it was a wonderful addition to her collection!,B0002MGB9K
Granddaughter loved the nightgown--just what she wanted.,B0002MGB9K
arrived when predicted. Fit great! Was a welcome gift!,B0002MGB9K
"Looks kind of old ladyish. Is very comfortable, fits pretty big, but then again I like my pajamas big.",B0002MGB9K
Have several but always want more.,B0002MGB9K
"Actually, none of the suggestions applied.  The gown  is perfect.  I can't wait to order more.",B0002MGB9K
The gowns fit perfectly.  The colors are great.  I had been looking for gowns like these for months & Voila! at my favorite store.  And at a great price.  I could not be more pleased.,B0002MGB9K
I have worn shadowline gown before and love it.,B0002MGB9K
I love Shadowline gowns and robes.  They have good coverage and can be used while in the hospital which is what I used them for this weekend.  Colors are beautiful.  The robes and nightgowns last a long time.  I am very pleased with my purchase and loved the price on Amazon!,B0002MGB9K
"Brought for Christmas present for my mother, she loves this!",B0002MGB9K
My wife LOVES these nighties. So comfortable and they hold up very well. So three Xmas later and I always give one as a stocking stuffer. (I like the look !),B0002MGB9K
This was a Christmas present for my Mom and she LOVED it. She sleeps in in often.,B0002MGB9K
Looked nice. Soft to the touch. The small is more like a medium. Had to return. Would have reordered but no extra small.,B0002MGB9K
I bought 2. The magenta and the teal. Excellant quality. The material is soft and a delight to sleep in. I would recomend these nightgowns.,B0002MGB9K
This is cool and great for summer,B0002MGB9K
it is way too large. would not reccomend.,B0002MGB9K
I love this gown  fits perfect.,B0002MGB9K
This Is for a lady at my work and is the only kind she wears its been the same for 20 yrs.,B0002MGB9K
"Very silky soft. Fit is not really that flattering, kind of looks like an old lady pajamas. Is fairly big and has no real curves or shape in the abdomen, making you look 20 lbs heavier. But with that said, they are very comfortable. I bought these for comfort, not style. Other complaint is the flowers in the front scratch a little, so not good for sensitive skin. Maybe they will soften up after a wash. Size fits somewhat big, but I ordered my regular size and it fits.",B0002MGB9K
color and fit were as expected. Nice gown.,B0002MGB9K
Love the way this feels and fits.  Purchased the matching robe to go with it.  Very comfortable.,B0002MGB9K
"This nightgown is beautiful and comfortable, per the gift recipient.",B0002MGB9K
"Love the color, just wish it fit better....too billowy!",B0002MGB9K
Bought this nightgown for my lady and it looks good on her.  It is soft and comfortable.,B0002MGB9K
This is a very pretty and comfortable gown.  I was looking for gowns and robes that could be worn comfortably during recovery from surgery and this fits the bill quite nicely.,B0002MGB9K
"This is one of my favorite gowns ever.  Soft and comfortable, weight of fabric just right, lovely and feminine.",B0002MGB9K
I love shadow line  gowns. They last longer than any other gown.,B0002MGB9K
Fit perfect and so easy to launder,B0002MGB9K
"High quality, lovely color, perfect gift, true to size.",B0002MGB9K
So compfortable! And so cooling in these hot days.,B0002MGB9K
"She's very happy with it: soft, cool, and comfortable, and a nice length that's not too short.",B0002MGB9K
"This nightgown looked good online, but material feels synthetic, slippery, and was more see through than expected. Also, while I usually wear a large, this gown was gigantic. Sent it back.",B0002MGB9K
This is just the right thing for Florida summer,B0002MGB9K
"Especially the color!  Accurate fit, good value for the price. I may need to order more for both of us!",B0002MGB9K
I've worn this this gown style for years and love it!  I especially like the cap sleeve...very comfortable.  I know I have at least four of these and they seem to last forever...well almost!,B0002MGB9K
"This fits and I like very much.  Even though a small, it is okay. Fabric very nice.  Will be buying more.",B0002MGB9K
Great gown for the price. Good brand all round. Lovely product line. Nice colors. Hand wash and hand to dry,B0002MGB9K
This is a very comfortable nightgown.  I bought two and they are practically the only two I wear.  I recommend it.,B0002MGB9K
"Looks and fits like I expected; howeverr it has not been washed so I don't know how the color will hold up.  Sometime ago I received two bright yellow ones.  They immediately faded out to the worst beigy/greenish color you could imagine.  Otherwise, they have held up very well.",B0002MGB9K
Love the color - just like the photo.  Rich feeling fabric.  Seems well constructed.  Washes and dries nicely.  My Mom is very happy with it.,B0002MGB9K
"Nice colors to choose from.  A nice fit and flow nightgown that has pretty embroidery and is very comfortable.  I like the length too.  Overall would highly recommend to those who don't mind not wearing ""cotton"" gowns.",B0002MGB9K
"Never had this brand before. Size small fits me just right - 5'3"", 132 lbs. The neckline is a little higher than I expected but the embroidered flowers are so pretty.",B0002MGB9K
"Very pretty gown and not too sheer.  Good quality and great color selections.  I've purchased several for my mom, and she has been very happy with the quality and variety of colors.",B0002MGB9K
This night gown is very pretty and very comfortable.  I will order more in many different colors.  The detail on the yoke is very nice.,B0002MGB9K
"Neck opening is way too big, so it falls around and is uncomfortable to wear.  I could not tell this by the picture.",B0002MGB9K
"My Mom loved it, will probably order another for her as she has already discreetly suggested. She said best gown she ever had.",B0002MGB9K
These gowns are very pretty colors but the fabric is so so thin. I'm sure the older woman would appreciate a bit more density to their nightgowns.,B0002MGB9K
"I gave this gown to a friend who usually sleeps in oversized cotton t-shirts & she fell totally in love with it! The color is pretty & the fabric feels really smooth against your skin, plus it's not too clingy or sheer. You'd think maybe the nylon-y fabric would be sticky when you're snuggled under a pile of nice warm blankets, but it's not at all. I admit that at first glance it does look a little like something you'd give your grandmother, but if she wears this one, grandma's got it going on.",B0002MGB9K
"This is a beautiful nightgown.  The fabric is a nice weight, and not at all see-through.  I usually order nightgowns one size larger, so I have room to move when I sleep, but this nightgown is very roomy.  I had ordered one size larger than normal, but had to return the gown, and get my normal size.",B0002MGB9K
"Was hoping for the material to be a bit more cottony, though.  It is as stated and advertised.  Fine for warmer weather when it is not ten degrees!",B0002MGB9K
This gown was a gift for my mother-in-law. She is a small frame but large breasted woman so I got a medium. The medium was more like a large. She still liked it- very comfortable.,B0002MGB9K
Mother loved this nightgown for a Christmas present.  She requires a higher neck and loved the style and length.  It is so pretty!,B0002MGB9K
"My mother in law wanted a new night gown and she likes the light weight one's.  She really like this one.
She said it is comfortable and fits her well.  She is very small and petite and the length was good for her.",B0002MGB9K
"I ordered this for my wife and was concerned ordering the small size.  To me surprise, it fit perfectly.  She his happy with it.  According to her, she would recommend it and the sizing is correct.",B0002MGB9K
This night gown is very comfortable and it is also pretty. You can even wear it as a comfortable dress. You can answer the door if someone comes to your house and you do not have to put on a robe.,B0002MGB9K
"I acquired this sleepwear product for my wife with some Vanity Fair sleepwear gowns for birthday gift for my wife.  She indicates they fit perfectly, the color, style, and quality of sewing etc are perfect.  She is totally pleased with them.",B0002MGB9K
This is a nightgown need i say more ? It was for a gift for a very particular person and since i can't find this brand anywhere close its nice that i can get it on amazon.,B0002MGB9K
"I looked everywhere for a Peter Pan's ""Wendy"" costume and the only one I found was a $48 one that I would only wear once.
I purchased this gown and added a blue ribbon under the bust and in my hair and it was PERFECT!  The fabric is also super comfy!
I celebrated Halloween in Disney and guarantee that I was the most comfortable one in my Peter Pan crew!
I've also added it to my PJ drawer for sleeping pleasure as well. :)",B0002MGB9K
Purchased this gown for my mother-in-law who is 99 years old and Loves her satin nightgowns.  She loves this and it is easy to wear & clean.,B0002MGB9K
"Loved this!  Fits well. I'm 5'1"" and wear a size 10 and I still have plenty of room in a med. Great purchase!",B0002MGB9K
it was as I expected.  I love the color and I know it will not fade.  it is flowing and soft for sleeping.,B0002MGB9K
"Lovely fit, stayed on my shoulders, soft cool material and went through the washer-dryer without a problem. What is not to like about this night gown?  The length is perfect for me, although I'm 5'8"" and it comes a bit below my knees.  The flowers are very feminine.  Choose purple and save some money!",B0002MGB9K
"Love these gowns! Have had a hard time finding these gowns, glad to have found them on Amazon.... fit perfect and are so comfortable. Ordered a sleeveless and sleeved gown both are fabulous.",B0002MGB9K
"about 4"" less in width than another same gown I have already...I put them together to see the difference.  It is acceptable.  I had thought the very same gown would be sized appropriately.  The color is perfect and true to my other Shadowlines,",B0002MGB9K
"This is the second Shadowline Gown I have purchased.  I have had the first for about 3 years, worn a lot and washed uncounted times.  It is still almost good as new.  I just purchased this as I needed another one for travel.  This appears to be of the same quality, only a different color, so I am expecting similar satisfaction from it.  The gown is cool and comfortable.",B0002MGB9K
This was an amazing gift to my mother in-law. She typically wears Moo Moo's and she loved this! What a deal!!!,B0002MGB9K
I have loved these gowns for years - they never disappointment me. They hold up extremely well. I will purchase this brand many more times.,B0002MGB9K
The colors are beautiful.  They wash well and dry quickly. I originally ordered 2 but when they came I ordered another one.,B0002MGB9K
Love the color of this gown.  I needed something comfortable and cool to wear in the summer months and this looked perfect.  It is just a little big on me but that makes it roomy so I'm happy with the purchase.,B0002MGB9K
It doesn't seem like it but these gowns actually keep me warm in bed.  I am 5'4 and 170 lbs and the large fits perfectly.  They wash and wear easily.,B0002MGB9K
Item was a gift and the person I got it for uses it to sleep in and they said its very confortable to sleep in,B0002MGB9K
Very comfortable and washes well. These gowns last forever. Good variety of colors too. Excellent for travel. You will not be disappointed.,B0002MGB9K
"My 35-year old pregnant-but-chic sister loved this gown for a house dress.  These are hard to find in anything but gawdy prints.  This solid color was a good alternative.  Still a bit suited for the elderly in style and color choice, but my sister didn't mind this sapphire color at all.",B0002MGB9K
Bought two of these for my mother and she is more than pleased and she is hard to please!  Easy to care for also!!!,B0002MGB9K
"I bought this nightgown for my elderly Mom and she loved it because it was almost exactly like the one I got her several years ago. It is lightweight and dries quickly, so it can be washed by hand and hung to dry. It can be machine washed, but I don't
think it would last as long. My Mom also liked the fact that it was wide and flowed freely so it was not too tight. I would recommend this product to anyone. I bought the short version and it was not too short and the sleeves are longer than portrayed. It also comes in a longer version for those of you who dislike short nightgowns.",B0002MGB9K
My wife and i believe this is the best gown she owns.  We have many gowns from many sources and this is the best.,B0002MGB9K
Mom has worn this gown for years. She always purchased them from a department store in town but it no longer carrys this brand. She was so excited that I found it here. its perfect for her.,B0002MGB9K
I got this as a gift for my sister-in-law and she said it was great. She said it was very well made and laundry well,B0002MGB9K
I got a bunch of these for my mom and she loves them!! Shadowline is wonderful and the material feels great!,B0002MGB9K
This gown is an absolutely beautiful gown that feels like a million dollars. I purchased it in this deep purple color as a gift and I can't wait to give it.,B0002MGB9K
"This was a gift for a friend and she loved the color and the rose embroidery.
It is such a nice change from the drab pink nightgowns.",B0002MGB9K
"I purchassed this gown for myself and have been very happy with it.  It is soft, cofortable, and it is very well made.  I think it will last a long time, and last...but not least...it is a beautiful coloor in sapphhire bluue.  I would highly recommend it.",B0002MGB9K
The colour is rich and the fabric is stable.  This is a good little nightgown for a senior lady who likes soft fabrics.  Size is true.,B0002MGB9K
"The gown pictured appears to be dark purple. I purchased a robe to match. The gown is actually lilac, not dark purple as shown. So the gown and robe set I purchased for my  mother does not match. As a care giver for my elderly parents I have no time to send anything back. I wished the gown and robe matched. The shadowline products are expensive and superior. My mother loves them. She would have loved them even more if they had matched.",B0002MGB9K
"Just the right night gown is so hard to find but this
is it! Great quality and perfect fit. So comfortable
and very pretty too.",B0002MGB9K
"I have often purchased this brand of 100% nylon sleepwear over the years.  I find the alternative polyester sleepwear scratchy and uncomfortable, hot, and unable to breathe.  I purchased two Shadowline gowns from Amazon.  One of them is just fine, but this one is not.  I washed both before wearing, and the hem unraveled and came out of this gown in the dryer.  I also noticed the Shadowline gowns are now made in Mexico, no longer in the USA.",B0002MGB9K
"Fits as it should
Great quality",B0002MGB9K
"Little shorter on me than pictured, but I am quite tall. Still really like the gown.",B0002MGB9K
The color is fantastic...i got pink.  Very vibrant!  Although I think it was a little pricey.,B0002MGB9K
"So pretty, & Christmassy! The red & green embroudry around the flowers on the black one made it feel lije the holidays, although I will wear it other times. I have this same gown in other colors, and I like all of them, but this is the only one where there is contrasting stiching around the flowers. The other colors have matching colored stitching around flowers. The contrast makes this one more unique. Very comfortable fit!",B0002MGB9K
I have rand of sleepwear for many years and love it! been wearing the b,B0002MGB9K
Fit my wife great !  She loves shadowline.,B0002MGB9K
Excellent material. The nightdress is see through!!!,B0002MGB9K
"This is my preferred gown due to chronic illness - just perfect, so I don't stray from this brand. And, this color is wonderful! I love it, so I ordered another one!",B0002MGB9K
real comfy thick awesome tight neck hole but i like it like that. true fit order your regular size. great color,B0002NYUE2
nice and thick i love this hoodie i order it in black in a large but should have order a medium because its a little big but i still workout in it and wear it when its a litte chilly outside,B0002NYUE2
"I'm 6'4 almost 300 athletic build, usually wear xxl but I was smart and paid attention to other reviews and ordered one size up.  The 3x fits well and is long enough. Nice all-around sweatshirt.",B0002NYUE2
"I liked the color on these -- I chose the safety green. However, I am a person who sports a large, and when I ordered a large sweatshirt and got a very small ""medium-at-most"" I was a bit upset. Still like this sweatshirt though.",B0002NYUE2
This is a nice hoodie for exercising or those winter moments. Fits ok and feels great.,B0002NYUE2

These are really nice sweatshirts.  My husband works outside and they are keeping him warm this fall.  He is a Mason and needs to be able to move and these shirts move well.",B0002NYUE2
After washing the neck hole shrunk slightly making it a littte  bit difficult to put on and take off but the rest of it fit perfect,B0002NYUE2
"Great hoodie, looks exactly like the picture!",B0002NYUE2
"This is my favorite sweater! It's perfectly oversized for that cute boyfriend fit so if that's what you are going for, get your actual size.",B0002NYUE2
Good hoodie it just makes those annoying lint balls but nothing a lint diffuser can't do !,B0002NYUE2
Perfect fit for my son which is unusual especially ordering online. The tan colored hoodie came lighter than what shows in the picture. I was a little disappointed since I ordered to match a pair of sneakers for my son.,B0002NYUE2
"Comfortable, warm and cozy!  My wife loves this hoodie!!  She normally wears a 3X in shirts, so I bought a 4X hoodie.  I figured she would have some bulk from the shirt underneath, etc.  Or possibly just want a little more room for comfort sake.  Apparently I figured right.  The hoodie fit perfectly as expected for a 4X and provided the necessary tummy coverage (since the fit is a bit longer) as I hoped it would!!  Great product!!!",B0002NYUE2
"Good fit, super soft. Great buy for the money",B0002NYUE2
10/10 would recommend. the inside fabric is so soft and comfortable. the size is fairly accurate and roomy. very light so not good for really cold weather like 50 and under but other than that fantastic. extremely amazing for the price.,B0002NYUE2
great pullover hoodie .... no shrinkage  or color loss.,B0002NYUE2
Love the softness and the fit and color is exactly what I wanted!,B0002NYUE2
Fit really nice. Thick enough for airsoft to!,B0002NYUE2
"These hoodies are paper thin.  Great for summertime, but if your looking for a warm hoodie this is far from warm.",B0002NYUE2
perfect color.  Had some pictures printed on it.  Turned out great!,B0002NYUE2
"Comfy, fits well, & affordable.",B0002NYUE2
"I love the color, perfect size, soft and comfortable !",B0002NYUE2
"The color is great, the fabric a little on the thin side but still good. I'm just worried it will be too short for the recipient. Otherwise, it looks good.",B0002NYUE2
Nice sweatshirts. Will  definitely order again,B0002NYUE2
Great! Everyone can see me running from a mile away.,B0002NYUE2
"Great quality, if your a woman order two sizes smaller. Super huge large lol",B0002NYUE2
Love so much I ordered 2 more! I might have one in every color by the end of the year.,B0002NYUE2
got the wrong color-- I wanted yellow and got pink,B0002NYUE2
"Bought for hunting season. Light weight, but still warm. Worked perfect. Bought it bigger so I could layer clothes under.",B0002NYUE2
Its ok it was whatr i was looking for,B0002NYUE2
"This is a comfy hoody. It fit pretty good but a little snug around the waist. I have washed it several times and did not seem to shrink at all. I like it and it is soft and comfortable. I wish I would've ordered a size larger, just for a little more room around my hips.",B0002NYUE2
Fabric was too light and came much smaller than actual size fit.,B0002NYUE2
"Really nice sweater for the price. I ordered khaki but in the picture it was darker, more like coffee.",B0002NYUE2
"Nice material, fits as expected. Will purchase more.",B0002NYUE2
Used it for costume making. Fit good!,B0002NYUE2
Comfortable and perfect for outdoor work.,B0002NYUE2
"I LOVE this shirt but really wanted a bit longer one for leggings so am returning for a bigger size. The rust color shown here is exactly accurate. It is a very substantial nice fleece backed heavy sweat shirt. I would really prefer to have more cotton than only 50%, but that is hard to find, and this is a great price. Think I'll re-order TWO, actually!",B0002NYUE2
nice hoodie but the fabric did bump up pretty fast. I would say it took a day of wearing for it to bump up.,B0002NYUE2
Quality jackets just ran baggy. Best to size down.,B0002NYUE2
Ordered it a little bit bigger than I needed so it would be comfortable.  It is super comfortable and warm.  Best thing is I don't have to advertise a logo everywhere I go.,B0002NYUE2
"so cozy, im a female but so cozy and pink is beautiful and warm.",B0002NYUE2
Please don't buy. Nothing like what u see on the picture,B0002NYUE2
"Color as shown, good price for weight of sweatshirt.",B0002NYUE2
Close to the wrist the sleeves are really slim & it gives the hoodie a weird look,B0002NYUE2
Nice basic hoodie. Nice vibrant color.,B0002NYUE2
The sweatshirt fit nicely but it has been started to pill again.,B0002NYUE2
the proportions are terrible. Torso area is not as bad but I could fit 3 of my arms in one sleeve.,B0002NYUE2
I always buy bigger so I can dress in layers.,B0002NYUE2
"The hoodie is HUGE-
I'm 5'4 and 115 lbs and got this in medium on accident, I meant to get a small. I kinda wish I did but at the same time the hoodie is the perfect shade of pink and really comfortable. The hood is thick and it's pretty good for the price.

EDIT-
I forgot to mention that it shrunk in the wash. Nothing big or noticeable except a little less than an inch off the sleeves.",B0002NYUE2
And had a tear on one side of the pocket,B0002NYUE2
Seems great quality; but haven't washed it yet.  Happy with it so far....,B0002NYUE2
Bought this for my daughter. She loves everything about it.,B0002NYUE2
Bought this pullover for my 12 year old son &  he loves it.,B0002NYUE2
"A happy bright pink sweatshirt, nice to have a basic cuddly one!!",B0002NYUE2
My son is into pink and loves this,B0002NYUE2
Extremely soft and comfortable. It's not too heavy and not too light.,B0002NYUE2
"Just plain old, over-sized pull over! I LOVE these for chilly evenings, fall days, camping....I wear Men's sizes, because they're roomy, and cover my butt, when I'm sitting on a bench or the ground.",B0002NYUE2
"Very soft. Fits well. Arrived ok, but was just stuffed in a mailer-no sealed plastic wrap. Previous same sweatshirts were tissued and sealed in plastic.",B0002NYUE2
"I love this hoodie for the price. It's not as thick as the Russell or Fruit Of The Loom hoodies that I have but it was less expensive and it is very soft and comfortable. I am 5'10"" and I am a muscular 195 lbs and the XL fits me just right.",B0002NYUE2
Really love this sweatshirt. Perfect oversized look on me. I bought a medium and it fit like a man's medium. Super soft inside. I like how it has no branding on it whatsoever. I plan on adding a patch on it somewhere.,B0002NYUE2
Another great buy & delivers very quickly. I am satisfied :),B0002NYUE2
I love the color.....perfect fit,B0002NYUE2
"I wear for the first time without washing and it fits good but after I washed it, it shrank, so, the next time I'm going to order extra large size. Thank you.",B0002NYUE2
"Great hoodie .
Comfortable and not too heavy.",B0002NYUE2
"The hoodie fits perfectly. A little long on the sleeves (in a good way). A very settled plain hoodie that can be layered or worn on its own. The Khaki color is light, almost kind of creamish. The material is strong. Overall. A good buy in my opinion.",B0002NYUE2
"I ordered this looking for a comfy but good quality hoodie and that's exactly what I got. I'm very petite, under 5 feet and about 105 and it fits as I expected. Slightly large but that's because I'm so small. It's super comfy and the quality is way better than I expected for a $10 hoodie. I have the vintage heather navy. I will definitely order some more!",B0002NYUE2
"Awesome hoodie that doesn't pill easily and keeps me warm. I wish the head hole was just a smidge bigger and that it maybe had a little more of a v-neckline to it, but regardless, my go-to hoodie. The baby pink color is the one I got and wow, it is so incredibly cute. So soft and fleecy inside!!",B0002NYUE2
"My boyfriend is 5'6"", 140 pounds and the medium fit him perfectly! It is a bit baggy but hey, hoodies are comfortable that way!",B0002NYUE2
"Great color, great fit! Not very heavy, but that's what I wanted!",B0002NYUE2
I wear these to work every day in Afghanistan. They have been through the washer numerous times and are holding up very well.  Great product!,B0002NYUE2
"When buying this product, I was just hoping to get a cheap sweatshirt that I could workout in, but I got much more once I had it.  It's surprisingly comfortable for its cost, and it has kept me very warm when it has been very cold.  So far the sweatshirt has held up very well.  This is an excellent product.",B0002NYUE2
I am really pleased with my order.,B0002NYUE2
Just as I expected love the material,B0002NYUE2
I actually liked the product. The only thing that was a negative was The neck area. It was extremly tight. Wish it was a little bit looser. Other than that I could've used 1 size bigger.,B0002NYUE2
My hoodie was too big so I sent them an emailing asking if I could send it bacc for a smaller and they told me no,B0002NYUE2
I received my order on time. It was exactly as expected.,B0002NYUE2
Great sweatshirt. Just don't let the strings touch any velcrow.,B0002NYUE2
This is a great sweatshirt and it's fits true to its size...but I read the other reviews and everyone is dying that it runs really small but in reality it doesn't so I got this in a large instead of extra large and I had to keep the sweatshirt (it was for my friend) and get him a different present. But if you like baggy sweatshirts or ones that aren't to tight I would suggest to get a size larger than you usually would:) So yeah hope this was helpful,B0002NYUE2
Not the color I expected at all! Very poor quality.,B0002NYUE2
This was purchased for my son and he wears it all the time.  Very comfortable and warm.,B0002NYUE2
A perfect fit Quality is excellent.,B0002NYUE2
Wife loves her new sweats for lounging at home....,B0002NYUE2
Not buying any other brand in my life. Period.,B0002NYUE2
"I love the hoodie but I've had it for almost a month and from wearing it about once or twice a week it is already developing tiny dust balls all over . If you are willing to find ways to get rid of the dust balls and maintain that brand new look like I'm going to do , then this is a really good deal .",B0002NYUE2
I am 5'0 and 100 pounds. Got a medium and fit me loosely which was what I wanted. Came as expected. The color is beautiful and good for its price. I suggest to go a size higher just in case it shrinks.,B0002NYUE2
"the hoodie is really baggie, a unisex S is always a perfect fit for me and the S was so baggy and made you look stuffy.",B0002NYUE2
Nice quality for the price!  Size is just right.,B0002NYUE2
"Great fit nice quality
Very comfortable",B0002NYUE2
"Love these things.  I got several colors.  I probably should have not got the black.  It collects hair and you can see it.  I like these shirts because they are so soft and comfortable.  I actually got one at my Son's school with his school logo, and wore it all the time because it was so comfortable.  I then bought 3 more on here for the price of the one at the school.  Very happy.  I will prob buy more.",B0002NYUE2
worked for costume we needed it for she still wears it,B0002NYUE2
"Pills very easily, will look like you've had it for a year after owning it for a month. Material is comfortable though and it's warm.",B0002NYUE2
Very soft and comfortable.  Looks great and seems to be high quality.,B0002NYUE2
"To keep you warm, Jerzees hoodies have thicker and better constructed material than Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, and other comparable brands. They hold up great to work, hunting, exercise, school, and many many wash cycles. Jerzees is hands down the best hoodie made in my opinion.",B0002NYUE2
Comes off and leaves blue fuzz everywhere,B0002NYUE2
"I'm a pretty big guy, so I was so excited to find something cheap and has a lot of sizes. I have a bunch of colors: Black, white, cyber pink, crimson and they are very durable. First one I bought was about two years ago, and still wear it today. If I had a complaint it would be that the neck hole is a bit tight, and the hood is a bit small, but the quality of everything else makes up for that, so five starts regardless.",B0002NYUE2
This is a very nice looking hoodie.  Cubby Blue!  Great fit and comfortable.  Having Cubs logo stitched on.,B0002NYUE2
I bought this hoodie for my daughter as part of her Halloween costume. The fit is exactly as we hoped and she loves that it's fuzzy inside.,B0002NYUE2
This was a gift for my boyfriend. He loves that it's wide and very comfy! Hasn't taken it off since I've given it to him :),B0002NYUE2
"Great color, material is soft, minimal if any shrinkage",B0002NYUE2
Thick nice quality sweatshirt for men. NEck hole can be a little small but fits true to size-order a size larger if you like a looser sweatshirt.,B0002NYUE2
Decent sweatshirt love that it doesn't shrink,B0002NYUE2
Fits perfect brought this for work,B0002NYUE2
"This is a great sweatshirt. Not too heavy, not too light. Perfect for those fall days.",B0002NYUE2
Very satisfied.  Love Jerzees.  This order replaced the one I'd worn out.,B0002NYUE2
Upon the first wash this shirt pilled up and looks absolutely terrible.,B0002NYUE2
"Nice hoodie for the price, wristbands are little tight.",B0002NYUE2
Love it. Every time I've ordered a lite blue goody it's been the wrong shade...this one is perfect. Love it!!,B0002NYUE2
"It met my expectations 100% cotton, I ordered it large when im an medium but solely for the purpose of my project and future growth. Its very comfortable to chill in all day, warm, cosy and well worth the price. Weirdly enough large was a perfect size especially if you have a partner slightly bigger or smaller than you. :)",B0002NYUE2
"Runs incredibly large and long, big arm holes. I bought an XL, I could comfortably wear a medium in this. Thin material, which is what I wanted. I'll wear it around the house.",B0002NYUE2
"Great material, nice and soft. Ordered a men's small it was slightly on the small size..I am 5ft. 7.5 inches tall and weigh 128 pounds..great price point for sweatshirt..ordered pink and the girls gave me a lot of compliments..not too pink..wish they made more colors",B0002NYUE2
"I'm 140 lbs at 5'1"", got a large hoping for something a little loose but it's pretty massive.",B0002NYUE2
"I just bought it too large, so i gave it to my mom...",B0002NYUE2
"I bought a large in this sweatshirt, desiring it to be baggy. Instead, it barely fits at all and even runs short. If you normally wear a medium size in sweatshirts, a large size in this may be fine if you're not too tall.",B0002NYUE2
My step daughter is thrilled and wears it every day.,B0002NYUE2
It was kind of thin and neck told small.,B0002NYUE2
"I wear sweatshirts pretty much every day. I'm so glad to have found this great sweatshirt line! Very well made, heavier quality cotton, wonderful color selection.",B0002NYUE2
"Seems to run a little bit small, but not too bad. Decent, cheap hoodie.",B0002NYUE2
"Great quality, comfortable and it looks good. Put it on and you'll automatically feel like you've just obtained superpowers you've never even imagined before. Not lame shit like super strength or super speed but like crazy kinda super powers you can't imagine. But, beware of the attention you might receive because it also acts as a visual aphrodisiac for people of any genders, this hoodie does not discriminate. It will love you and stay with you till you're old and crusty, not like the people you hangout with and call your ""friends"".  But on the reals it's actually a really good hoodie for the amount of money you're paying for this product.",B0002NYUE2
Its really good quantity but is bigger than i spected,B0002NYUE2
dont put it in the wash.. the coloring comes off and ruined my other clothes,B0002NYUE2
Great value for price...washed it twice and no pilling so far!!!!,B0002NYUE2
"Great fit and colours. Very comfortable and great for working out in, studying in or wearing out when camping.",B0002NYUE2
I was worried because I only saw one picture posted in the reviews and didn't know what to expect.  But it was exactly what I wanted.  Ordered a large,B0002NYUE2
"This was for my Tord cosplay, fit great though the neck opening was a little too small",B0002NYUE2
"Gave this as a gift to my brother. He is tall (6'8"") it fit him very well. It was long enough in the arms as well as the torso. Its been awhile since he got it as still wears it. it has been washed many times and has not faded",B0002NYUE2
"I bought 4 of these for the staff of The Carousel Of Light in Falmouth MA.  We are a local non profit running a carousel, trying g to raise money to find a home for it. It was made in Falmouth and trying to keep it there.  We bought these to go with our t-shirts that are also neon pink. We need to be seenand this cor is perfect!  The sweatshirts are cozy warm on cool nights that we have on Cape Cod.  Thank you for having a great product!",B0002NYUE2
Purchased a 1-2 sizes larger because I thought this was a true fit type of thing but it came in way too big. It doesn't shrink in the dryer either.,B0002NYUE2
Comfortable and arrived before the expected date.,B0002NYUE2
This is exactly what I wanted.  Just your standard nothing on it hooded sweatshirt.  Soft and fits well,B0002NYUE2
Somewhat good. I like white color when it paired with blue jeans.,B0002NYUE2
The color is exactly as advertised very rich and rather nice but the sweatshirt itself is nothing special.,B0002NYUE2
This is the second one I bought - and I can say that with proper care - mine still looks brand new and is so soft and warm! It is all comfy cozy and I would definitely buy more if I needed them. Mine is very large - so I cannot be sure of the sizing since I like mine to be very big and baggy and this does fit exactly as expected and I love the pink! Hard item to find especially in such large sizes!,B0002NYUE2
"Washes well, nice medium weight. Good quality!",B0002NYUE2
"love the color, material seems solid, very very comfortable. great price. fits just as expected. the arm are a little bit for my taste but whatever.

the hood isn't too big or bulky. i really like this sweatshirt !",B0002NYUE2
Well made but not for skinny guys. It tight around the wrists and extremely baggy.,B0002NYUE2
Love this neon pink. Exactly what I ordered.,B0002NYUE2
Very great quality.... Would refer to family and friends!!!,B0002NYUE2
Everything met or exceeded expectations.,B0002NYUE2
"I ordered a medium, but it fits like a large. I think a small would fit me better with this product and that's surprising because I'm usually in the middle of medium and large, with large fitting better and medium a bit tighter. It's a bit baggy on the sides and on the arms. The length is good. The quality of the material is what you expect a $15 hoodie to have - not stellar. Looks like it will loosen up even further and lose its elasticity after a couple washes.",B0002NYUE2
Exactly as expected.  Great quality.  True fitting sizes.  Normally wear men's medium T's.  Ordered men's M pullover hoodie.,B0002NYUE2
Yup it fits as wxpected love the sweater and the color black is awesome I use it everyday,B0002NYUE2
Great product! Exactly as described.,B0002NYUE2
Its a sports hoodie.  We use them as team hoodies.  I ordered a size up for my husband and I and an adult small for our 90lb 10 year old.,B0002NYUE2
"very low quality. It began falling apart immediately. If more companies sold in this color, I would have bought a higher quality sweatshirt. It served it's purpose briefly but I already need to replace it 2 months later.",B0002NYUE2
"its nicely made, but the sleeves are very disproportionate to the torso, way too bug and baggy which is disappointing",B0002NYUE2
"Nice fabric but too small, Dickie pullover runs true to size",B0002NYUE2
Nice quality and quickly arrived,B0002NYUE2
"I ordered this and got this within a day!
Great quality as well~",B0002NYUE2
Fits great and the colors is vivid.,B0002NYUE2
Ordered a size 4xl and got a large with ciggeret ashes on it.,B0002NYUE2
Worked well!  Ironed on a picture.  Just as expected.,B0002NYUE2
It was just what i was looking for,B0002NYUE2
I ordered it Wednesday and it came on Friday. And its a great hoodie,B0002NYUE2
Better than I thought. Comfortable and the drawstrings work well.,B0002NYUE2
"This sweatshirt is a nice soft material inside and smooth doesn't pill up on the outside, it's just a little thinner than I expected but that's fine it's still a great hoody.",B0002NYUE2
"I wear a large in some shirts and xl in some, I ordered a large based on the reviews. Cons: The arm length is good but the body of the shirt is short, too short. Also, when I tried it on for the first time I put my hands in the hand warmer pockets and one of the seams ripped a little, may have been a one in a thousand defects who knows. Pros: There are no logos on the shirt, it's light weight and it arrived very quickly.",B0002NYUE2
Great material and very comfy. Ordered the size I usually get in sweaters.,B0002NYUE2
What I did not expect was fuzzy fleece on inside. Nice and warm.,B0002NYUE2
This item is worthy of five stars,B0002NYUE2
exactly what I ordered. Fits well.  Comfortable and reasonably warm.,B0002NYUE2
I am 6 feet 220 lbs. I ordered a XXL and the fit is just right. And I washed it and it still fit.,B0002NYUE2
Grandson loves this brand of sweatshirt and I have ordered several different colors over the past two years.,B0002NYUE2
It's so nice and warm. And it's a good quality material and great price.,B0002NYUE2
"I couldn't believe how hard it was to find a hoodie this color, at a fair price and sized small! My daughter needed it for her Halloween costume, it came two days after I ordered it, and was exactly the color shown! Thank you!",B0002NYUE2
order size up because it shrinks!,B0002NYUE2
"I read a review saying to order a size larger than your original size since it will shrink after washing it, not true. I washed it as soon as it came because I noticed it was quite big since I ordered an xx-large just in case it did shrink, it didn't shrink. I'm not gonna return this item because it's very pretty (I ordered pink lol) and even though it's a little big on me, I think it's cute that it's oversized and it's almost winter so it's alright.",B0002NYUE2
"For the price, material and quality is great.",B0002NYUE2
"Such a great sweatshirt, especially for this price! Warm, thick, cozy, and it hasn't pilled or frayed at all yet. I love it.",B0002NYUE2
It's gonna work out for what I have plans on making a diy baymax halloween costume! Feels super comfortable!,B0002NYUE2
"excuse my english, the sweater is very good, I love it",B0002NYUE2
The hoodie is nice and warm but they do run  a little small,B0002NYUE2
nice sweater really cozy. would recommend,B0002NYUE2
I got it to monogram and it fit a little big but it was a comfortable bigger fit. I love it.,B0002NYUE2
"I used this sweatshirt to create a personalized birthday gift (using IRON on vinyl) and I think it turned out great! The quality was good, nice and thick  - but keep in mind it has a ""long"" fit.",B0002NYUE2
"I should have gotten a smaller size, but its ok. I was only going to use it for a Jack Frost cosplay but as it is kinda large. Its very comfortable though, perfect for cold days when you just want to snuggle in sweats",B0002NYUE2
My friend wore this a lot!!  Thank you.,B0002NYUE2
I'm a big guy so this fit exactly the way I wanted especially since I have long arms and torso.,B0002NYUE2
This sweatshirt met my hopes of size (LG ~ roomy> and color (royal blue)!  Will e ordering in more colors!  Thank you!,B0002NYUE2
"Bought this for my ""BIG"" son, he likes to wear his pullovers on the big side. I thought the xxxx thought it would be a great fit. My son said it was to short. And once washed definitely won't fit. Had to go to mall and purchase another one to replace this one.",B0002NYUE2
"I bought three other Jerzee's hooded sweatshirts sized XL and they fit perfectly.  For some reason this one fit much tighter, more like a size smaller.  Disappointed, really liked the color.",B0002NYUE2
"The arms are so huge! The rest is fine, but why are the arms made so huge?!",B0002NYUE2
Fits great! Fabric is soft and I love it.,B0002NYUE2
Awesome & plenty big for xlarge guy!,B0002NYUE2
Color is different than expected,B0002NYUE2
If you're a hoodlum who needs to remain inconspicuous and/or hooded up. This is perfect for you.,B0002NYUE2
Love it. Very nice for the price! Would order again.,B0002NYUE2
"First time I started wearing it, LOVED it!  After washing it, the outside of the sweatshirt balled up and noticed alot of the red came out into the wash and the red also comes out in the dryer---so don't wash with anything else on the first wash except with the very darks which is what I did; lucky for me.  I still wear it but just disappointed with the drastic change of material after the first wash, hence the 3 stars instead of the 4/5.",B0002NYUE2
I purchased this hoodie for myself (woman) and immediately received compliments. The white is very pure and the construction is solid. It fits as expected (I am short and well-padded) and was a great value. I will purchase again.,B0002NYUE2
Good hooded sweatshirt for the price. I'm happy with my purchase!,B0002NYUE2
"Comfy, but I got the XXL and while the shirt itself is roomy enough, the cuffs are regular size, so if you have big arms, you can forget about pushing up your sleeves. I actually cut the sleeves off at the elbow.",B0002NYUE2
"I gave this to my friend and she found it to be a bit snug, but no real complaints.  It's a fair product and arrived on schedule, which made me real happy.",B0002NYUE2
sent  to the cold and hungry in NYC. JIM,B0002NYUE2
"Can't beat the price on these! Better quality than I expected, too!",B0002NYUE2
Bought this for my husband and he loves it.,B0002NYUE2
This hoodie washes well! Washed 3 times and still so soft! Will order again,B0002NYUE2
"Fit perfectly upon first wearing. After the first wash, in COLD water and dried on LOW heat, my XL is now basically a L. I bought 2 others and actually hung to dry, and still shrunk. Oh well, I'll stick to buying the more expensive blends that don't shrink. Salvation Army has them now and hopefully they found a home where someone can benefit.",B0002NYUE2
Bought this for a Halloween costume and then passed it onto my son. Very good quality and great fit.,B0002NYUE2
Super comfy and soft inside and fits just right! Life it,B0002NYUE2
The size large was much larger than it showed styled in the photo.  Returning it because it is too large.,B0002NYUE2
fits and feels great - nice quality!,B0002NYUE2
For a sweatshirt under $20 it is a fantastic sweatshirt. I've worn it nearly everyday since I purchased it a couple months ago. It's as simple as a hoodie gets with as simple of a price as you can expect.,B0002NYUE2
"Very nice for the price. Its EXACTLY what your looking at, except order a size larger than what you are. I got a medium (which is my size) and its fits pretty well, but just a little small. I haven't washed it yet but it should get even smaller. However, i didn't buy this for fashion, i needed something to keep me warm sometimes when i run or expect to get messy, so i think it'll do good doing its job.",B0002NYUE2
It's a well made and inexpensive sweatshirt. It fit in line with what we expected from standard sizing.,B0002NYUE2
My son loves this hoodie - wears it all the time.  Great product at a great price!,B0002NYUE2
"Great sweater.  Just too small.  I am 6'1"" 205 pounds and I wish I had done a size bigger",B0002NYUE2
The Sweatshirt fits well; is warm and cozy.  Probably will order another one in a different color if offered.  Great gift for my significant other.,B0002NYUE2
"Great, quality product and at a reduced price, from the department stores.",B0002NYUE2
"fits great, sleeves are great length (ordered 3XL) and the jacket is very warm but lightweight for a hooded sweatshirt.",B0002NYUE2
Exactly as described. Thick and soft. Great price,B0002NYUE2
a little lighter weight than I expected.,B0002NYUE2
"We thought that this would be a thicker sweatshirt but it's hard to tell what thickness you'll get online... I know they say ""8 oz"" or something like that but to me that doesn't mean much so we thought these would be a little thicker but for the price we were very happy they didn't shrink in the wash and I washed the regularly (no special treatment).  My boyfriends tends to layer his clothing anyways because he works outdoors all year long so even though they were thinner than we wanted it all worked out okay  Plus he needs to wear safety orange, or yellow or neon green so this worked out well for that purpose plus had a hoodie.  Great product!!!",B0002NYUE2
"I love this sweatshirt.  We have heavily wooded ground and the hunters are all around.  Hopefully, in this I won't get
mistaken for squirrel, deer, or rabbit.",B0002NYUE2
The arms were tight its a nice hoodie though,B0002NYUE2
This hoodie was reasonably priced and is quite comfortable to wear.  The quality was better than expected for the price paid.,B0002NYUE2
"I absolutely love this style of hoodie, so I purchased four in total. AMAZING product! I cycle through them during the week, and I adore how comfortable and stylish they are. Buying more soon!",B0002NYUE2
There isn't much to say about this hoodie. I usually wear a small but night a medium because I wanted a big hoodie for those cold lazy days. It fits my needs very well. I had mine for over a year now and still wear it whenever it gets cold. The wrists are tight which is a huge plus for people like me with super thin wrists. Good quality. Would buy again.,B0002NYUE2
"Loose fitting, wears well with multiple layers of clothing underneath, good quality. would purchase again",B0002NYUE2
"Ordered a large (which is usually too big for me), but it was very tight and I had to return it.",B0002NYUE2
"True to size, very comfortable!!!",B0002NYUE2
I usually wear a Large so ordered Xlarge for shrinkage.  When I tried it on way too small.  Can I exchange?,B0002NYUE2
"It's soft, warm, durable. Fit is perfect and the color matches the description.",B0002NYUE2
"Love it! Perfect color, size and weight. Oh, and the price was right too. Just what I needed.",B0002NYUE2
Nice product for the money. Would purchase again!!!!!!!,B0002NYUE2
I should have ordered a larger size. But I am satisfied I like it and I will still wear it.,B0002NYUE2
It doesn't fit to size it's a little snug.,B0002NYUE2
"Ooookay, just to explain the fit here's some facts: I'm a female who is 5'6"" and weighs about 116. I like a lot of ro in my sweatshirts so I ordered a mens medium. When I first saw it I was worried I had made a mistake by not ordering a small but I tried it on and it's awesome! It may be too baggy for some but I think it's just long enough and the sleeve length is great for keeping my hands warm. I haven't  taken it off all day, it's so soft, and I just like how basic it is. The only reason I have it 4/5 stars is because it's not as thick as I had hoped.",B0002NYUE2
Very nice medium weight hoodie. I use mine as a top with lounge pants for household wear in the cold months. Very comfortable!,B0002NYUE2
"The  pull over hoodie is medium weight, the pocket runs across the front and will hold a lot . The hood has a tie ,the pull over is lightly water repellent.  I used it in 45% F,  it was fine as the outer garment.  This is the only hoodie that s some what water repellant.",B0002NYUE2
These were more like bright tangerine. Not what we expected.,B0002NYUE2
Dyed this and sweatpants and they maintained their dyed color very well. Fits and feels good.,B0002NYUE2
"Exactly what I was looking for.  Thick, comfy, warm.  Love it!",B0002NYUE2
perfect. i had it personalized for my son at an em roidery shop. its a bad mother....hush your mouth. my son wear these instead of  coats,B0002NYUE2
nice warm true to size well made,B0002NYUE2
"yep, if you are thinking this is too good to be true for hoodies, well you are wrong - very happy, buy it",B0002NYUE2
"Soft and comfy. I ordered it bigger than I need so I can another myself in its warm goodness and I am super happy. :) Nice price, too.",B0002NYUE2
Great price. Great fit. Overall a very good product.,B0002NYUE2
These sweatshirt is so comfortable and warm. I may purchase more in the future.,B0002NYUE2
Daughter Loved this and it fit perfect and she's picky.,B0002NYUE2
I really liked this. It's very comfortable for the price.,B0002NYUE2
"At first, I wasn't sure whether to buy the Hanes hoodie or take a chance with this brand, so I got both and I gotta say I definitely prefer this one over the other. I got the maroon color which is a first for me but it's soft, true to color, and it fits nicely. The other one was too warm and didn't feel right, very happy with this purchase.",B0002NYUE2
Wonderful color rich & vibrant.........fits well.......very happy with my purchase,B0002NYUE2
Great fit. Perfect weight for a cool fall day.,B0002NYUE2
I was thrilled to find men's hoodies on line in different colors.,B0002NYUE2
Thank you! It is just what I wanted and for a good price.,B0002NYUE2
"Used as a joke to dress a friend up as kenny from south park, worked great",B0002NYUE2
"Excellent product.  Excellent price.  I was afraid it might shrink a bit in the dryer, normal heat it did not.  I'm going to order a couple more for the Fall.  Great Deal..",B0002NYUE2
Soft inside and so warm. Exactly what I was looking for!,B0002NYUE2
"I needed a pullover w/ hood, this is just the ticket.",B0002NYUE2
I've had one of these since 5th grade and I'm graduated now. I can't believe I found a new one. Best hoodie ever.,B0002NYUE2
"Warm enough!
Little price and good quality.",B0002NYUE2
I LOVE this sweater. So soft and so warm. I wear it constantly.,B0002NYUE2
"I'm a female who needs these for work. I ordered a large since I wanted a little room. These, once washed, fit very snugly. So, definitely order a size up if you want them to be a little more forgiving. The pockets also ripped from me trying to stretch them out a bit after drying. Color has remained very vibrant though.",B0002NYUE2
Bought at my daughters request.  It fits her well and she has had no complaints.,B0002NYUE2
"My Step-Children's Mother loved it, the color look better in person than on the computer, it is brighter. Does not shrink when you wash it in cold water.",B0002NYUE2
"I bought two sizes too big, so I could have wiggle room in it, and it so far, is one of the best pieces of clothing I've ever bought on here, the only downside is that it attracts my cat hair.",B0002NYUE2
"Nothing too fancy, but for the price you get what you pay for. The pocket was sewn on crooked, and the fit is a bit smaller than expected.",B0002NYUE2
"Very very comfy, but only thing was that it was a little bigger than i thought.
I recommend it very much though",B0002NYUE2
My husband is a farmer and these are his favorite sweatshirts for everyday wear. They fit as expected are not too heavy and have gone through the wash MANY times and have held up great. I highly recommend.,B0002NYUE2
"It is a great sweatshirt for the price, a little thin but ok.  I wish there were more color choices, like bright yellow.",B0002NYUE2
"Child's small fits as a women's small/medium
The sweatshirt is Very good quality
awesome color
soft and comfy
Washes well",B0002NYUE2
My favorite hoody. Very comfortable and not too tight around the neck.  I bought one of these several years ago and just about wore it out. I was thrilled to find the same one on Amazon and the price was right so I bought 2 and might buy another color.,B0002NYUE2
"I love this sweatshirt. great product and great price. My only issue is I bought 3XL because I knew it would shrink down to a size that still felt very roomy. But the 3XL size feels more like a 2XL which means when it does shrink, it will probably be tighter than i prefer. I would expect a 3XL to feel huge on me and these dont.",B0002NYUE2
"I wasn't very pleased with this sweatshirt,it was stated anti pill but it is terrible I've tried everything for it not to pill but with no success,too bad to because I love the color",B0002NYUE2
It is brighter than the picture - which I absolutely loved! Super soft and hasn't pulled even after multiple washings!,B0002NYUE2
"I love this and wear it all the time. The only issue is that it has begun to ""pill"" with wear. I have similar ones which I bought in the late 1980's which have never pilled at all. Oh well. Very warm, very convenient for carrying the camera when out with the dogs.",B0002NYUE2
Great feel to the material and it is very warm just like it should be not too thin to go for looks.,B0002NYUE2
"The size is exactly to fit, it's very thick & cozy! I LOVE the color, I ordered it because it's still cold in my area and it meets every type of climate, rain, snow, wind, etc... I would recommend this hoodie to anyone!",B0002NYUE2
"it fit just fine but i thought the color was going to be darker, so i had to return it.",B0002NYUE2
I found the sweat shirt fits great but it did pill around the neck line almost immediately. Other than that issue I would give it 5 stars.,B0002NYUE2
This sweater is very comfortable and very cozy recommend purchasing sweater fits very well and wend it starts to get cold i throw it on and it feels delightful,B0002NYUE2
I'm small with unfortunate big boobs. It fit over them and left me with comfortable arm and waist area. I slept in it. That soft I recommend this product.,B0002NYUE2
"The fabric began to ""pill"" (form tiny fuz balls) quickly.  I only washed it in cold water :-( It is comfy.",B0002NYUE2
"I have to tell you, I paid a lot for these  Shirts, they fuzzed up when I washed them, I washed them inside out and on cold water, I did not like this, and would not buy more.",B0002NYUE2
"I literally wanted a plain grey hoodie, and that's exactly what I got.  The size is spot on, and it washes really well. It's warm, and the hood is a good size.  Fits comfortably under a jacket, but also nice enough to wear on its own.",B0002NYUE2
Make sure to wash it separate as it gives off alot of fuzz. Wish there was a headphone hole in the pocket.,B0002NYUE2
my fav sweatshirt I love it fits great and love the color which is hard to find in mens. I like mens better because they fit better. I like them big and baggy. great product,B0002NYUE2
"When I ordered this hoodie, I was looking for a lighter weight one for the cool spring mornings and nights.  I also prefer my hoodies to fit a bit bigger for extra roominess.  This hoodie met all of my expectations, and the bright color is fun too.  Plus you can't beat the price.  I'm thinking about ordering more colors for myself and my husband, as well.",B0002NYUE2
"Fit perfectly n didn't shrink a size after washed.  They had a Soft interior lining, so I'm prob gonna get a couple more.",B0002NYUE2
"I am 6'0"" and 215 lbs.  I ordered an XL.  It was way, way too small.
The fabric is nice, however, and the fleece(?) inside is very soft.
So... very good quality; order it a size up.",B0002NYUE2
"A little big for a medium, but haven't washed it yet so it may shrink..love the color and the soft fabric!",B0002NYUE2
Fits great.  Washes up great.  Does not get out of shape when washed and dried. Holds it color. Fits as expected.,B0002NYUE2
This was a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter...a men's medium fit her perfectly...enough room for a shirt under it...seem the kids are all wearing these now...it is a nice quality too...,B0002NYUE2
"Real nice pullover, especially for the money.
Lots of colors to choose from too, and every size you can think of.",B0002NYUE2
The fit is true to size. I got the large and just out in the dryer to see if it will shrink...,B0002NYUE2
At first I was super pleased with the product. I LOVED it. But then I washed it. I bought the largest size they had because I like big baggy hoodies. It shrank so much that I can't even wear it now. It looks like a child's hoodie now. I looked for weeks to find exactly the right hoodie. I don't like the kinds that are thin material or have zippers. Now I have a hoodie I loved that is going to end up being passed off to a neighbor kid. Complete waste of my money and time.,B0002NYUE2
"i am very happy with the weight of the fabric, color and fit, I love hoodies and will be back for more.",B0002NYUE2
Fits loose and light . Great for spring. Not to heavy to wear in 60 degree weather. Going to get more. Great price,B0002NYUE2
Yes! A gray hoodie! Fitted as I expected and snug :D too bad my time with it lasted a short while since it got hot pretty fast! But I wear it as pj's and at night!,B0002NYUE2
The ash color looks much darker in the picture than it really is. I was expecting a different shade of grey.,B0002NYUE2
Excellent warm hoodie- great for winter. More like a sweatshirt than a thinner fashion hoodie. Color is quite a bit brighter than pictured- I like the real color better than the one in the picture.,B0002NYUE2
"Warm, comfortable, well constructed, just what I had hoped for although I had wanted to get it in my college color(s).  Definitely worth the price.",B0002NYUE2
This product is of very good quality & has many nice colors to choose from.  I'm very happy with it.,B0002NYUE2
The shirt was more red than expected or appeared in the ad.  It did come as quickly as stated and did fit well.,B0002NYUE2
"i'm a 5'3 and 120 lbs. i usually wear smalls but the reviews say  these sweats run small so i ordered medium blue and just love it. sizing turns out to be true so it is a little too big for me. i recommend you order your size ""not one bigger"". it is perfect for 12 dollars. couldn't beat the price. i was expecting some bad quality sweat but this sweat is fantastic. it is soft in and decent hood. the color is as picture. i will get a logo put on.",B0002NYUE2
Well just got it and its EXACTLY what i wanted!! Came really quick minus the 3 day weekend...lol. Would recommend to all!!,B0002NYUE2
"It fits me perfect (I'm 6'1"", 250lbs) and is warm but not too warm. Hood isn't too big and the front ""pouch"" pocket is nice.",B0002NYUE2
"Good product for the money, but like a lot of plus size clothing was wide enough but no where near long enough. Great if your not especially tall, but avoid or go up a few sizes if you are tall.",B0002NYUE2
This shirt looks good on my man I would recommend to others also the fit is perfect. this looks good with his vest,B0002NYUE2
Very pleased with this sweat shirt.  Bought it for my grandson for christmas.  It is very hard to find in this color.  Price was nice too...,B0002NYUE2
I should have ordered more and ordered it sooner.  So comfy to wear and great color that is hard to find in stores.,B0002NYUE2
Way better than I expected a $12 hoodie to be. I mean WAY better. Very comfortable. I've had one for a few months so far and I'm definitely gonna get like 4 more.,B0002NYUE2
love the color and this hoodie is true 2 size would def buy more from this seller and they had lots of colors :),B0002NYUE2
"This hoodie is absolutely perfect, epecially at the price that I got it for (which I have noticed has increased). It's so soft and warm and fits a bit baggy on me, which is how I wanted it. I ordered a medium. The head hole however is a tad bit small which makes it a bit difficult to get on and off smoothly, but that isn't a big deal. Overall I love this sweatshirt and I would love to order more.",B0002NYUE2
Came in plenty of time. Perfect fit. Keeps you nice and warm for winter. Not the reason I got it for though.,B0002NYUE2
"I bought this hoodie for my girlfriend. She usually wears a Large. I was afraid to buy this hoodie online because i was unsure of how it would fit. but it fits perfect! Fits her just right! The material was great, very soft on the inside. The blck color was so good and rich, not faded at all. I would def. buy this again! The price was also good! what a great deal, and great quailty. hope this helps!!",B0002NYUE2
"This hoodie fit well (use your gut instinct on your size. If you typically wear large, chances are you're a large. It is what I did) with the sleeves' cuffs actually held the sleeves in place so they didn't flop about. The inside was warm and fuzzy, the hood is snug to the head and the pocket holds a lot. Might have to shove a bit past the opening, but I fit my wallet, two cameras and my phone so I feel it worked well.",B0002NYUE2
I found this as a replacement for existing jacket. It is very ccomfortable to wear as primary jacket or as a layer,B0002NYUE2
"The material and the exact fix, and I would recommend this product to all my friends, and will continue to buy this brand.",B0002NYUE2
"I read on the reviews that this product ran a little large, so I purchased one size down from what I usually would, and it was perfect.

I am a little disappointed that the sweatshirt is made of all synthetic materials. Not enough cotton, which was not clear from the product listing.",B0002NYUE2
"This is a Great pullover, it is nice and warm and fits great.  And the color is exactly as pictured.",B0002NYUE2
"I have been looking for a simple grey ""leisure"" sweatshirt and am very happy I stumbled upon this!!!  It is very soft and warm!!!",B0002NYUE2
I am crazy about hoodies and have been looking for the perfect maroon hoodie. The color is just as pictured and this is honestly one of the most comfortable hoodies I have ever worn. I for this and a plain shirt under it in 30 degree weather and I stayed pretty warm.,B0002NYUE2
I'm very please with this purchase. The cost was very reasonable and the quality was better than expected. Great color too.,B0002NYUE2
Bought this as a present for my husband. It fit perfectly and is of good quality. It's become his new favorite sweatshirt.,B0002NYUE2
"Bought a second Ash/Grey sweater because the first one fit so well and is so warm. But what the hell with the price increase??! The whole idea here is that the sweaters are warm and cheap, I even gave recognition of that in my first review. Luckily the color I wanted didn't have an increased price. The sleeves of the sweater are a little baggy, but nothing to hate. Good buy if you're a college student just looking to be warm in class.",B0002NYUE2
if your tall and want a long hoodie this aint for you ordered a medium sized hoodie and was too short ended up giving it to one of my friends,B0002NYUE2
"I am a runner and in the Winter do most of my running at night.  This hoodie provides a highly visible color contrast to headlights and gives good protection and warmth in 30-40 degree temps for running.  I'm 6-2, 175 lbs and the large fits me perfectly.",B0002NYUE2
yes I would recommend to someone. Is really nice for the cheap price. Its very comfortable and fits nice. I got my normal size I wear  in jackets which is a medium. The color is bright too and I love I that way!,B0002NYUE2
"I ordered this item for myself, in a larger size than I usually take. I'm very happy with this idea. I love the color pink, and will wear it alot! It's big enough to wear other things underneath, I like that.",B0002NYUE2
"Immediately came on Amazon to tell you guys how great this hoodie is. If you're looking for a plain black pullover that's not super heavy, this is the one. It's lined inside with fleece but only a very thin layer, enough to keep you warm but not sweaty. And it's soft! The hood is nice and big too and the pocket is also lined. I'm a pretty average sized lady and I ordered a medium, which is a perfect fit.",B0002NYUE2
"just what I was looking for - a baggy sweatshirt that fits over whatever else I'm wearing. Heavy enough to keep warm, but not so heavy you have to take it off as soon as you go inside.",B0002NYUE2
Another plain run of the mill hoodie but seems to be of a good quality.  We will see how it holds up,B0002NYUE2
"Wife loves it. Washed 3 times and still held bright pink. No bleeding,warm,cozy wears it all the time. Purchased 2 more lime green and Longhorn orange.",B0002NYUE2
"Great sweatshirt, but it fits a little snug.  It also washes well, and the color stays correct even after washing.  Tumble dry on a lower temp else it will be even snugger.",B0002NYUE2
"I had purchased a different brand of sweatshirt that I sent back and I ordered this one instead.  This was fantastic!  The material, fit and color were all wonderful and exactly what I wanted.",B0002NYUE2
"Bought this to replace my boyfriend's old, worn-out, ratty hoodie, and he absolutely loves it. Very thick and cozy. Super comfy.",B0002NYUE2
"I think the hoodie fit slightly small, and the color although lovely at first, became discolored very quickly. Wouldn't buy again.",B0002NYUE2
"True to size and color--midweight fabric, perfect for layering. Inside is nice and soft. Love it--got the pink and the red:)",B0002NYUE2
This is a gift . . .sent to another address . . .wrapped by someone else and won't be seen until Christmas.  How am I suppose to rate this???,B0002NYUE2
"I like it, it is comfortable, I love the color, it feels good and it's not expensive. It is a good option...",B0002NYUE2
Nice looking item! I like it so far. Came on time and fits well. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of style.,B0002NYUE2
I needed this sweatshirt for a Halloween costume that I was constructing.  It was really nice quality and worked out perfectly.  The chocolate is a true chocolate color.  I ordered an XL because I needed a oversized fit for the costume.  It worked great.,B0002NYUE2
"highly recommend this hoodie. Its nice material, warm and comes in many different colors. Washes great as well.. A +",B0002NYUE2
Fast shipment.  Fits as expected.  Very comfortable.  Fiance is an Iron Worker and wears these on cold mornings.  Very satisfied.,B0002NYUE2
"Love it and like how it keeps me warm . I wish I had ordered two instead of one. Love how it has a casual neat where with jeans , or exercise wear look. Not in item that would go unworn , and remain in the closet over the years to gather dust. Glad I got an extra size big , because sometimes clothes can shrink up in the dryer.",B0002NYUE2
my kids love wearing hoodies this makes a nice stocking stuffer great to run around in super gift thank you,B0002NYUE2
"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PULLOVER, because its so big and WARM, however the neck and wrists are somewhat small but i guess it will stretch over time! :)",B0002NYUE2
the price and fit and feel of these was very good nice and clean and soft lasting cotton hoodie I needed,B0002NYUE2
"I love the sweatshirt, great color, great quality, and awesome fit.. UNTIL I WASHED IT. Once I washed it it did shrink and is now too small for me to wear. I gave it to my mother and she really likes it.

Bottomline- Good high quality sweatshirt, made of a soft but smooth material, but I recommend ordering a size above the size you want, do not be fooled by the term pre shrunk.",B0002NYUE2
"Looked everywhere for this for my daughter for school.  Perfect color, perfect size, and just what she wanted at a great price. thank you.",B0002NYUE2
This is a nice light pullover hoodie. It's excellent for raking leaves in the yard. It's not very heavy due to not having any lining on the inside.,B0002NYUE2
Love this sweater color looks great hoping it dosent shrink I always order jerzee brand items love them so much,B0002NYUE2
"The price, quality, etc are great.  I use these for the gym and am totally harsh on them.  There are minimal signs of wear.",B0002NYUE2
"Nothing special here, I thought it would be much heavier weight but the price was cheap.  I liked the broader selection of colors, otherwise I would have just bought basic colors at Walmart (same price, same quality).",B0002NYUE2
"My husband loves his ghetto frumpy grey sweatshirt from 25 years ago, and I don't.  So I bought him this Jerzees hoodie in navy blue, his favorite color, to replace it.  He's worn it a few times, but he still prefers the old one.  Despite my husband being in great shape, he doesn't like things too snug or form fitting.  This hoodie is soft and strong, but it's not very bulky, so it appears somewhat thin, if you will.  I love this look on him (and others,) but he does not.  He enjoys the sweatshirt enough, but he doesn't LOVE it like he does the other.  And, well, my opinion is that it's awesome, but he's the one wearing it... so 3 stars it is.",B0002NYUE2
"Fits as expected.  The color is nice and deep.  Material is thick and warm.  Hood and strings are well constructed too.  Haven't washed it yet, so don't know how long the color lasts.",B0002NYUE2
You cant get a better sweat shirt for that price. The quality is great and the color is exactly as the one in the picture.,B0002NYUE2
I bought several of these for my husband and son as gifts.  They were true to size and have held up over many washings.  Will buy one or two more soon.,B0002NYUE2
"I was shocked cause I ordered two others they were awesome than I figured it out this one was a different seller and manufacturer!
Well one wash the pilling was insane the sweatshirt looks horrible even after rolling it for two hours three sticky rolls later it is now a car rag!
Not happy will NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AND MANUFACTURER AGAIN!",B0002NYUE2
"I really like the color of this sweater and it fits perfectly fine. The size of the arm runs a little big, but other than that its a good for the price.",B0002NYUE2
I really wanted a something that would be thick and warm and this sweatshirt was perfect.  I would buy another.,B0002NYUE2
"Good quality, and long enough to cover your bum. I bought a large, usually where a medium, but I wanted to wear it with leggings, and a shirt underneathe. Perfect!",B0002NYUE2
It's a nice shirt.  It has very soft material and didn't shrink much after the first wash.  The main reason I bought this shirt was the safety green color.  It's very bright and allows me to be seen very easily in thickly wooded areas.,B0002NYUE2
"I have this same pullover in black and it washed up fine, but this color pills really bad. Everytime I want to ware it I have to shave it with the Pill remover.",B0002NYUE2
"Beautiful color, nice fitting and the price was wonderful..  Washed and dried a few times and it looks like new.",B0002NYUE2
"Love the color, the fit, everything. Its so bright. But, I love that about it. Always received products in a very timely manner. Will order again I am sure. Would recommend to everyone. I like mine a little bigger so I ordered a size larger. I wear it with leggings and high boots.",B0002NYUE2
This sweatshirt is very thin. It does fit comfortable but is just a lounging sweatshirt or a sweatshirt for the early fall.,B0002NYUE2
"Muy buena calidad, y muy buen acabado de la tela, color espectacular y lo mejor de todo e precio, felicidades al vendedor.",B0002NYUE2
"Although the cuffs ripped from being stretched around his forearms at work all night, the color looks great after hundreds of washes. I sewed the cuffs back together and it's still going strong.",B0002NYUE2
Very sturdy sweatshirt and washed up great. No shrinkage at all.  I had it embroidered with a school logo and it turned out beautiful.,B0002NYUE2
"Ordered an adult medium for my son who wears adult small -- this hoodie runs Small! -- after washing, it is hardly bigger than a Gildan size small hoodie he has.  Just purchased a medium Champion brand from sports store -- Great fit on that one!!",B0002NYUE2
"this is thinner than most hoodies, but that was what i was looking for. it will be a great fall/spring hoodie that i can wear with shorts and be just perfect. seems to be made of same quality as other hoodies. hood is pretty large and fits loosely just like i like it. very satisfied, great for the price.",B0002NYUE2
"Giving this a 10..........medium weight, comfy, good quality.",B0002NYUE2
"These are great sweatshirts! Soft, durable, bright colors! I got two for my kids (10 and 11). They wear them constantly!!",B0002NYUE2
"The color is right, not easy to find this color and quality is good too. Size medium if for men is little small, but still is fits right for me. Im really like it.",B0002NYUE2
Shrinks order larger size than you wear.,B0002NYUE2
"Love this hoodie, fits true to size, perfect color. Only downside is that the fabric has gotten super peely",B0002NYUE2
"Very comfy and durable sweatshirt. I'm normally in between a medium and a small as I am pretty tall, and I ordered a small. Fits perfectly! Already washed it and it did not shrink by much (if at all).",B0002NYUE2
"This is a comfortable, light-weight crew-neck sweatshirt. It's generously cut, so it can be used as a top layer. It's easy to care for.",B0002NYVYQ
Great sweatshirt for working out or casual wear. Fits properly fabric is soft not scratchy. Does not fade when washed and dried.,B0002NYVYQ
"The color of the sweatshit is beautiful.  The drop sleeve is a little full, but the weight is very nice for the cooler months.",B0002NYVYQ
"Arrived very quickly! The product was nice, not too heavy material and the color was fine. was given as a gift and he liked it very much.",B0002NYVYQ
"I love the Jerzee product line--we live in the country and spend a lot of time outdoors.  Thses clothes are the best,",B0002NYVYQ
"This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors, but if you want a quality heavy  weight sweatshirt this is not it.",B0002NYVYQ
The quality of the shirt is good however it does run small for the sizes.,B0002NYVYQ
"Very comfortable. It did shrink a little when washed, but it was negligible. The color did not run when washed.",B0002NYVYQ
Got the 2X as a gift and the recipient really liked it.,B0002NYVYQ
"I bought a 4x so I could have a really, really oversized sweatshirt. and it's perfect! Its so soft and hasn't lost it's softness through washes.",B0002NYVYQ
Very comfy! Room to move. Soft.,B0002NYVYQ
"For normal sized folks I don't think this is thick enough to keep you warm outside if its colder than 55 degrees. For us big guys and girls if you run hot like me its perfect. Thin enough to wear inside on a cold day if you don't want to run the heater and thick enough to wear outside on a cold night. Mind you I'm from California so don't start thinking you can wear this on a snow storm lol. I hardly ever use my jackets or hoodies cuz it's never quite cold enough or I'm mainly indoors (bars, home, restaurant, work) but this is great. Its flexible and doesn't feel like im being choked. And sized run as expected btw.",B0002NYVYQ
"I like this very much. It's a great gift. Good quality, priced right!",B0002NYVYQ
Would buy this product again very well made..,B0002NYVYQ
Nice quality fabric - not too thin at all.  Has held up well after a couple of washings & dryings.,B0002NYVYQ
Great sweatshirt good price sure to buy more,B0002NYVYQ
I love Jerzees. Great sweatshirts,B0002NYVYQ
Great fit and comfort you expect from a sweatshirt.,B0002NYVYQ
"No shrinkage, color as shown in ad. Just ordered a size to large.",B0002NYVYQ
"This sweatshirt is incredibly soft and well-made for the price.  The sleeves are a little long, but I was hoping for them to be that way.  It's a GREAT buy.",B0002NYVYQ
"Very large-just what I wanted.

Update April 2018:  sweatshirt pills badly- only wear around house to work in..Wish this wasn't true.",B0002NYVYQ
"Soo comfortable and such a nice, simple sweater. I love it and I am bringing it with me to Alaska!",B0002NYVYQ
"Might be better after it's washed, just a little too big across the shoulders; but it is comfortable.",B0002NYVYQ
Has terrible chemicsl smell that won't come out even after several washes.,B0002NYVYQ
"Took a long time to receive it, so only have had it a couple of weeks and it has been washed 2x, the collar is starting to fray around the neck.  Probably would not choose this brand again.",B0002NYVYQ
"ordered XXL and fits about the size of a medium, would not buy again, good quality but a shame it did not fit the person whom I gave it to, they gave it to their son.. disappointed.",B0002NYVYQ
Even the XL seemed a bit larger than some manufacturers XXL.,B0002NYVYQ
Like the softness of fabrick.  Could be somewhat longer. I would buy again,B0002NYVYQ
"Very comfortable to wear, just seems to run big in the sleeves.",B0002NYVYQ
"I specifically ordered this large for a big sweater for every day use and to use as a costume (Frisk from Undertale).
It's SUPER COMFORTABLE and very soft. The color is great and I've worn it almost every day this week.
It came in a week too, which is great.
Overall great buy",B0002NYVYQ
Looks good fits welll like the shirt,B0002NYVYQ
nice and warm. Our days are getting cooler.,B0002NYVYQ
"Hope it doesn't shrink, I bought a much bigger size because I like them baggy. So if it does shrink a little it will still be like I like it!",B0002NYVYQ
"I bought this sweatshirt not expecting anything amazing, but I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome the quality was! The outside doesn't look cheap like I wasn't expecting and the inside is increeedddiblllyyy soft. 10/10 on my scale",B0002NYVYQ
..thinking it would be slightly heavier in material...but all in all no issues,B0002NYVYQ
Fits perfect and is very comfortable.,B0002NYVYQ
Completely satisfied with this sweatshirt.,B0002NYVYQ
"The sweatshirts were great. The order came a little earlier than expected. Fit was good, material comfortable. Color and quality hit the mark. Washed nicely. These get an A. Price inline with others of the same quality.",B0002NYVYQ
seems well made so far .i have not washed yet,B0002NYVYQ
HUGE! I ordered the 3x & it was way too big for me.,B0002NYVYQ

The only thing I don't care for the how bright it is. I guess I was expecting a more pumpkin orange but I still like the sweatshirt.,B0002NYVYQ
"Very nice, simple sweatshirt. I like the fit and feel. Nice powder-blue color, too -- doesn't look artificial. Plenty of room -- just like an old-fashioned sweatshirt should!",B0002NYVYQ
This was for my husband and he wears it all the time especially when he is hunting.  Washes great.,B0002NYVYQ
"These items were purchased for needy children for Christmas, this item was a request from the child we picked.  I'm sure they will love the sweats since they requested this color and size.",B0002NYVYQ
"I have several 2XX sweat shirts in my closet that are Jerzees brand that are a little big for me, I like them a little sloppy, but this was big enough for a big tall man.  I'm giving them as a Christmas gift to my daughters fella. I can't figure out why there is so much difference in the size now.",B0002NYVYQ
"It was priced good, but the fit was small",B0002NYVYQ
A bit light weight but overall good quality.,B0002NYVYQ
"this is a gift, I am sure that it will be a good fit. nice and heavy, well made..",B0002NYVYQ
I like the quality of the material and the color. I was so happy to get the order earlier than expected,B0002NYVYQ
"Yes, I ordered a very large size since i basically wanted a soft comfy cover-up that I could wear as a moomoo or swimsuit cover or evening sweater...
The material is light enough not to be thick&annoying, it is a pretty color that doesnt shock the eyes, just so very lady like!!!
Im HAPPY!!",B0002NYVYQ
Bought this shirt to make an 80's costume.  It was just what I needed.  Great quality and great price.  Item was as pictured.,B0002NYVYQ
"Just the right weight...soft, comfy...nice choice of colors.  Will order more.  The size seems to be true and the quality is amazing for the price.",B0002NYVYQ
I loved it it fit like expectected and I was able to enjoy it somewhat this winter and will order more in the future.,B0002NYVYQ
The fit was fine. It was lighter weight fleece than I expected. The grey color was just what I wanted.,B0002NYVYQ
"Great value, great fit, low price; so what else would you ask me to do. I'll probably buy another one.",B0002NYVYQ
"You get what you pay for. Cheap materials, fabric piles after a few washes/uses. Not to be confused with higher quality sweatshirts.",B0002NYVYQ
Cuffs and neckline are larger than on items ordered in previous years.  Always orderthis size to get extra length but Appears sloppy,B0002NYVYQ
"I bought this as something to wear around the house on cold days.  It is very comfortable, warm enough without being too warm, breathes well, and no designs or logos to bother with.",B0002NYVYQ
"I have this sweatshirt in several colors and they're very warm, thick and very nicely made!  I'm certainly going to continue buying these in more colors!",B0002NYVYQ
I purchased this in a size 2XL knowing that I was going to use it as the basis of my pumpkin Halloween costume. It turned out great. I'm 5'4'' and this was the perfect length to cover my bum. The fabric was heavy enough and didn't fray when I made some cuts to it. Warm on a chilly Halloween in the Midwest!,B0002NYVYQ
"These sweatshirts are made of a good material, with minimum shrinkage.
They are very comfortable to wear, warm and the material in not scratchy.",B0002NYVYQ
I was very please with the quality of this sweatshirt. It has held up with several washes. I would recommend this sweatshirt.,B0002NYVYQ
It is an amazing sweater. This is as good as I was thinking. Fits perfect and the color is as I expected.,B0002NYVYQ
Received sweatshirt quickly and it was pretty blue as pictured and very soft.  It was very nice roomy size.  We purchased it to transform into an 80's exercise shirt.  Very pleased with the sweatshirt.  a little sad that we cut it up but the finished off the shoulder outfit was also really cute!!,B0002NYVYQ
"The small is perfect! It fits wonderfully! It fits well enough that It doesn't look too oversized but still has the lazy big sweat shirt look..if you know what I mean. The material is great! It's soft and comfy, but not so thick that it gets too hot. If you're wondering whether you should get one? totally go for it! I bought one to try it out, since the smalls are so cheap as it is, but Im so in love with it I bought another 4 today! if you're in college and the class rooms are just too darn cold and you want to dress lazy but cute..I definitely recommend getting this!",B0002NYVYQ
"Beautiful sweatshirt in my favorite color. Always been a fan of Jerzees products, a well made high quality product as usual.",B0002NYVYQ
I love the quality of Jerzees - just wish they were made in the USA -- great color - doesn't shrink - perfect sweatshirt,B0002NYVYQ
True to size! Which is very hard to find sometimes. So glad I found this. So comfortable.,B0002NYVYQ
Seems like a nice garment for very casual wear.,B0002NYVYQ
"Quality  is great, and  the price was even better .",B0002NYVYQ
I like the slightly roomy fit and very soft material the best.,B0002NYVYQ
Began to pill after a few washings.  Fit as expected.  Nice and warm.  Will not wear it out of the house due to pilling.,B0002NYVYQ
"I'm 5'8"". And the shirt literally goes down to my knees.",B0002NZ1XG
"Good shirt for wear under my ACU (Military) Uniform. I dislike the cotton blend issued T-shirts. This color is compatible with new ""SCORPION"" Camo.",B0002NZ1WM
"you might get a season out of this shirt if you're lucky.  the workmanship is really shoddy.  the shirt hangs like a potato sack.  the material is that shiny kind of fabric that makes it stand out as a cheap shirt from a distance.  it is hard to find any shirts in the color brown, so I took a chance with these and bought a few of them, but I was surprised that the quality standard was so low.",B0002NZ6L8
i bought this for work but the material isn't that great. The color kind of faded after washing it 3 times,B0002NZ6L8
"It's ok for my med size.but it's  long
the material is nice and looks fine.
Thanks for the good job.",B0002NZ6L8
"The description says silk touch and I was expecting a softer close knit finish, It is actually pretty much a pique style. There is nothing silky about it.

The shirt is comfortable, well made and looks great so the difference in my expectations don't matter. I like it so It still gets a 5.

I would recommend that you size up unless you want a snug fit. I usually buy XL locally but I have learned to go up a size for inexpensive shirts on the web. The 2XL fits me perfectly",B0002NZ6L8
"My brother couldn't find the 'kelly'/'irish' green polos anywhere when he was looking for them.  I found them here on Amazon and for the price, the quality is very nice...can't beat it!!  I ordered a few more in different colors for him so he could have a variety!",B0002NZ6L8
"my husband gets dry skin  so he finds most fabrics rough and uncomfortable, This shirt is an exception. The fit was perfect , and will stay tucked in.",B0002NZ6L8
"ok, but  a little thin, would be nice if thicker shirt,.like the idea of no iron.lots of colors. price high for this kind of shirt.",B0002NZ6L8
"This blue shirt was selected from a search for a polo shirt with a pocket.  I ordered two shirts.  The tan one came with a pocket.  The blue one did not, and while disappointed that the shirt came without a pocket, I opted not to bother returning this item.  I will order more polo shirts with pockets--but next time I will not keep any item that comes without a pocket. I can get all kinds of shirts without pockets at any local  Walmart.  I expected better when I searched for shirts with a pocket, and one came through without one.",B0002NZ6L8
This is very good quality product and very good price.,B0002NZ6L8
Arrived on time. Fits nicely. The fabric is cool in the summer. It has some give which makes it comfortable to wear as a cashier. Does not wrinkle much. Long enough to tuck in or to leave untucked. I would buy from this dealer again and I have suggested this dealer to my coworkers.,B0002NZ6L8
Not the same size a Large shirts I already have,B0002NZ6L8
"The material and fit are excellent  ,location will comment on  durability in 6mo",B0002NZ6L8
"I ordered a size Small and it really feels like a Medium or Medium-Large. The body base and the arm cuffs are too wide. I fit very well in sized Small and that what I order. When the shirt arrived, I tried it on and it was too loose in almost every opening. I feel like I was suppose to gain 30-40 pounds just to fit in it. I double checked my order and sure enough, I did order a small. Even the tag says ""S"".

As for the feeling of the cloth, it does not feel like silk. It feels like a hybrid of polyester and cotton but cheap and more of the polyester feel. I guess for $11, you get what you paid for. I learned my lesson and will search for more quality shirt than this one.",B0002NZ6L8
Came right on time. perfect fit got  alot of compliments on the shirt I got. I will definetly buy from them again!!!,B0002NZ6L8
The cut of the shirt is a little more snug through the shoulders compared to other XXL polos.,B0002NZ6L8
"This is the worst shirt if all time. It is cut very small around the waist while the shoulders are way too broad. This caused the sleeves to be extremely long. Unless you have gigantic shoulders and a tiny waist, this is not the shirt for you!",B0002NZ6L8
"I'm 5' 2"" and an extra small was too big for me",B0002NZ6L8
"For the price, these shirts are perfect.  I've purchased several and had no issues.",B0002NZ6L8
"These shirts are really nice. The collar does not bunch up after multiple washes, they really hold up well.",B0002NZ6L8
"These are very good shirts. I bought one a few months back and wear it weekly. After being laundered once per week (about 8 times), it still looks good as new. The collar still has its original form and the size fits exactly as it should. Overall, it is a great shirt. Well worth the price!",B0002NZ6L8
The k500 made and material is good but the size is too big. Medium is like extra large; not a true fit.  The medium K510 stain-resistant polo fits perfectly.,B0002NZ6L8
"The material feels light and breathable, but does a good job keeping you warm. Very comfortable overall. The cut is slightly more tall than ""wide"", so as a overweight but tall dude they fit really, really well.

They look good and they're cheap. Planning to buy more.",B0002NZ6L8
"I have ordered several of these in various colors. Be cautious about the Burgundy/Maroon color, I have ordered two in the 2XL size and they have both been much larger than the other polo's in the same order.",B0002NZ6L8
"shirt had a snag but company gave for free, Amazing",B0002NZ6L8
Need to order a larger size but great quality shirt!,B0002NZ6L8
"I bought a medium. I normally like mediums for a tighter fit. This shirt is not a medium. It fit me like an extra large. 5'8"" 165 lbs. Muscular build.",B0002NZ6L8
Great price!  Will buy again from this seller!,B0002NZ6L8
"Great shirt, great price. What's not to love?",B0002NZ6L8
"Unfortunately it's not that shiny, silky material that the better sport / golf shirts are made of, but it's also not the thick, ""pique knit"" material that makes you itchy and sweaty. It's halfway between. The actual color is NOT as saturated and blue as the stock photo shows, it's a washed out and pinker-looking lavender. It's fits well and is light weight, but it does show some wrinkles unlike all my other polo shirts. Considering how little it cost I'm not really disappointed, and I chose not to return it, but you get what you pay for. I only bought this online because the color was impossible to find locally.",B0002NZ6L8
"Really nice shirt, fits wells and breathes....bought these for my husband and he wears them to work. It is now his official uniform so to speak. Would highly recommend. Good quality for the money.",B0002NZ6L8
I usually wear a tall shirt so I specifically looked for this model from Port Authority because they are long enough and fit well.  Actually bought several.,B0002NZ6L8
"These lightweight soft shirts were sought out for purchase. Amazon price was 1/3 less than other websites. So many nice colors to choose from, all available in size men's XL, and every shirt was free of defects. They did not appear to shrink noticeably.  Since these are a ""favorite"" comfortable shirt for summer, I'm sure we will be ordering more in the future.",B0002NZ6L8
"Excellent fit, and quality, just as I expected",B0002NZ6L8
"Great retail work polo, if it gets destroyed your not out a lot.",B0002NZ6L8
"the first shirt in this color we received was an x-tra large, which was much too large.  it was returned for a large, which was still a little large, but comfy.  we love the shirt, just wish we could get the maui blue one we odered!",B0002NZ6L8
The best polo shirt for the money that you can buy! I use these at work and they maintain their size and shape over time - unlike most other brands.,B0002NZ6L8
I wrote a review on these shirts before wearing and washing the latest purchase. The quality of the shirts have changed from my previous purchase. They are now of less quality and shrink horribly. Will never purchase again.,B0002NZ6L8
Good fit. I like the material. Good value for the price.,B0002NZ6L8
"Good fit., very light airy material . Perfect for hot summer days here in California.",B0002NZ6L8
"Good shirt, not too thick, not too thin. Tail is nice and long so it will stay tucked!",B0002NZ6L8
Bhought these in a long sleeve for my husband went back for the short sleeve because we love them so much great price great fit super shirt,B0002NZ6L8
Very nice shirt and it fit just right.,B0002NZ6L8
Not at all what we thought. Totally unsatisfied with it.,B0002NZ6L8
Shirts are soft to the touch but a durable fabric.,B0002NZ6L8
"I'm 6'2 175lbs and the medium fits great. A lot of polo shirts sleeves are too short in a medium, but these shirts cover nicely.",B0002NZ6L8
Nice polo and good value for the price,B0002NZ6L8
I am very pleased with this product.,B0002NZ6L8
"Inexpensive shirt, but fits and feels great.",B0002NZ6L8
"Too large, normally a large will fit me well to sort of snug, these hang off me like a blanket.",B0002NZ6L8
I like the two I bought for my cleaning business. They fit perfect and I like the colors. It's nothing fancy and what I needed for a fair price.,B0002NZ6L8
One of my shirts had hole on left side where it didn't get sewn correctly.,B0002NZ6L8
"I really like these polos. I was given one with my company logo, and really liked it. Unfortunately, now I have a strong dislike for that company, so I had to donate it, and order a couple plain ones from Amazon.

I usually wear Large (and sometimes XL) t-shirts, but I was swimming in the Large version of this shirt.  I'm a 6-1, 210 pound guy, and the Medium fits me perfect. The polo looks great untucked because it is the perfect length and does not have that annoying bell shape that makes you look 40 pounds overweight. All 3 of these polos I have owned have fit the same, so it is good to see they are consistent.

These are great polos to wear at my engineering office. You should probably wear something a bit nicer when going out, but are great for their purpose.",B0002NZ6L8
Great quality shirt and very soft,B0002NZ6L8
Fits perfectly. Quality shirt. Will buy more in different colors,B0002NZ6L8
"The medium fits and feels fine. I normally wear a large, but it was way too big.",B0002NZ6L8
This shirt is way too small and short for a 6xl shirt.  And there are some runners starting even before the first wash.,B0002NZ6L8
Would like to exchange one of the shirts for a medium size. They seem to run larger then the size needed please send a label. Thank you.,B0002NZ6L8
This is a great product for the price that it is being sold for. Much warmer than I expected and fits great. I will probably buy more in the future. Great colors!,B0002NYVV4
i already have my Jerzees! i bough 5 jerzees and every single one are so good! softy and prettys!,B0002NYVV4
"It has become a real challenge to find a simple, normal sweatshirt in deep, rich colors. This shirt by Jerzees is ideal. I also like the fact that it does not have a hood! I've ordered this sweatshirt in several basic colors; it's a staple in my colder weather wardrobe.",B0002NYVV4
"Wow. Just wow. Stretchy, comfortable, and deep color. I simply can't take it off. People are starting to complain about my smell, but they can stuff it. This product was made for me.
Some polling in the breast area where my arms swish against my torso when I walk. But I'll be damned if the haters shame me into changing my shirt.",B0002NYVV4
Very large on top.  Sleeves are way too baggy.  Cheaply made.,B0002NYVV4
I bought this and cut the neck and cuffs off. I have had many compliments.,B0002NYVV4
Great plain sweatshirt but it was too expensive. Easily could've found this somewhere else for a cheaper price.,B0002NYVV4
"the color is different from the ""royal blue"" I expected, but acceptable",B0002NYVV4
Its so soft and warm. This is the second one I ordered :) I order a size up because like my sweatshirts a little big. Sweatshirts are a staple in my closet. Ill definitely order more,B0002NYVV4
I ordered more than 1 and each sweatshirt is a great fit and quality product. ShoeOcean is an excellent retailer to do business with.,B0002NYVV4
Good color. Came a couple days later than I anticipated.,B0002NYVV4
"Not as pictured with the mock neck, it's also grey not black",B0002NYVV4
This is a nice sweatshirt. I love 50/50 blends because they don't pill and they also drape well. The color goes great with blue jeans.,B0002NYVV4
this product wears and washes well.great product.,B0002NYVV4
I like the fit and the fact that its different that many other sweatshirts. In the sense that it is shorter to the waist and not long that goes pass the butt. I had these sweatshirts when I was growing up and liked them a lot back then.  The color selection is more expansive and they're reasonably priced. After one wash Im satisfied with how it came out. Cant come up with any negatives.,B0002NYVV4
"Super soft, washes beautifully.  Love the soft pink color",B0002NYVV4
"I'm usually a size M 150lbs. I ordered both M and S, but I liked how the S fit better. Also, I ordered in ""Classic Pink"" and ""Pink"". The two colors looked the same to me. It's so soft on the inside. I love it, and highly recommend!",B0002NYVV4
It was perfect didn't find anything wrong with it,B0002NYVV4
XXX-L. I thought it wouldn't fit but it fit perfectly. Will buy another one.,B0002NYVV4
"It could be a little wider. I like sweatshirts to be
More roomy so I can wear something under it.
Otherwise I love the color and quality",B0002NYVV4
Shirt is very comfortable. Much softer than expected. I have not washed/dried it yet so I am not sure how much the size will be affected but it fits nicely right now.,B0002NYVV4
Bought this pink sweatshirt for my fearless 13 year old grandson who claims pink isn't just for girls.  He's worn it to school twice already and absolutely loves it.  It acutally looks really good on him and he wears the color pink very well.,B0002NYVV4
"items came VERY fast, good quality, great price",B0002NYVV4
Size was perfect and color was what I had been looking for .,B0002NYVV4
"The product arrived with what appears to be two small cuts on the left sleeve.  The product is very thin, and has poor quality.  Would not recommend this product.",B0002NYVV4
"*I'm a woman
Nice color and weight, rather warm. I know it's a men's sweater, but even so the arms were super baggy compared to the body.",B0002NYVV4
"Used it for St. Patrick's Day. Fit well, roomy and warm.",B0002NYVV4
"It was everything I hoped it to be. Great quality, if only I could get more for less",B0002NYVV4
Really tight and chokes at the neck.,B0002NYVV4
"I love Jerzees sweatshirts.  I just should have ordered a size smaller since it was a men's shirt.  Other than being a little large, it is a great sweatshirt.",B0002NYVV4
"My boyfriend keeps telling me he likes the color on me (I got the pink one, the soft pink one). He keeps asking when I'm getting him one.",B0002NYVV4
"Great fit, the blue is the best color!",B0002NYVV4
"Fits just the way I like. not too loose and not too tight.  The color is great,a little out of the ordinary!",B0002NYVV4
"Very comfortable. Seems to run large but Im not familiar with the brand and how sizes typically run. I couldve ordered down a size or two. Washes well, doesnt shrink.",B0002NYVV4
I loved it I wore it as a dress fits perfect and its super warm and cozy,B0002NYVV4
Pleased with the sweatshirt overall.  Wish it didn't have a tag.,B0002NYVV4
xactly what I wanted in size and fit. The black color is perfect with my needs to replace a well worn  older shirt.,B0002NYVV4
The color is so bright its blinding,B0002NYVV4
"Great ""knock-around"" sweat shirt - I use this for all my fall and winter chores - it is warm and comfortable. You can do yard work, an oil change, or go out for a run... this is a great sweat shirt.",B0002NYVV4
"Liked the shirt, the only problem the sleeves were a little to long, so I just pushed them up. I needed petite which I couldn't find.",B0002NYVV4
I got this because of color for safety a lot more comfortable then I thought it would be nice fit front of neck doesn't feel like a noose that you stretch by keep pulling on it,B0002NYVV4
"Fits as expected, intentionally loose. Purchased  Medium. Im female, 53, 135 lbs,  Attracks animal hair.",B0002NYVV4
color is good but the fitting isn't perfect. Its a bit large for the size,B0002NYVV4
Received items as described...the material was comfortable...the fit was perfect.,B0002NYVV4
"This sweat-shirt (is not) manufactured-of the customary heavy material, actually pretty-thin; Neck opening is to large, allows cold-air to find it's way-in . . . Will-be worn around the house, won't see any rough-duty.",B0002NYVV4
The length is quite long for the large size,B0002NYVV4
"Sleeves are a bit long, but otherwise the fit is good.  Material is good.  It is nice and warm.",B0002NYVV4
I love the color of the neon green. It's really soft inside.,B0002NYVV4
Bought these just for outside work and they are fine.  Good value for the price and would buy again.,B0002NYVV4
"Was disappointed that the gray was not heathered like it looked in the photo, overall feels comfortable, fairly lightweight, and fits slightly baggy like I wanted (I'm 5'4"", 160)",B0002NYVV4
good quality medium weight sweatshirt,B0002NYVV4
"I wear a woman's large, and I ordered this in a men's X-Large and so it'd be baggy (because I like my sweaters baggy), and it fit like a women's large or x-large, not a men's. It's comfortable though, and I like it, just make sure to size up.",B0002NYVV4
"great fit & very, very comfortable",B0002NYVV4
Order larger than you need. shrink after wash,B0002NYVV4
As advertised. Comfy. Vivid color.,B0002NYVV4
Good quality. Fits as expected.,B0002NYVV4
"I absolutely love this sweat shirt, the color i got is perfect and so bright. Its also so cozy and warm inside. Worth the purchase.",B0002NYVV4
Purchased for a halloween costume (snorlax). 5XL fit my normally 2XL husband with a standard pillow sewn in for padding.,B0002NYVV4
Its was just perfect Just a lil big,B0002NYVV4
i love it . it was exactly what i wanted it fit perfect i am ordering more colors i just got it in black . going for pink next . the only problem i would says is the cuffs of the sleeves can get pulls,B0002NYVV4
"I'm 5'11"" about 135lb got a Medium
It's just right for an oversized hoodie but just a little boxy
The inside is a super soft fleece but the outside is just a little ruff but all together very nice for the price",B0002NYVV4
This was big medium size. Like everything but the size comes big.,B0002NYVV4
"The color is more of a hot pink, rather than the more pastel pink featured. Very disappointed in the color.",B0002NYVV4
"I ordered an xl and ended up cropping this sweater for the perfect oversized cropped sweater look. Im a womans US size 10/12 190lbs and a 38  DD in the chest, before I cropped this sweater it fit comfortably at my hips, if you are the same build as me you could wear this size as a comfy big sweater but not big enough to swim in it, this is loose enough to be a comfy baggy fit and not be form fitting OR suffocate my chest.",B0002NYVV4
Good fit. Good material. Well satisfied with purchase.,B0002NYVV4
Love it. Soft on the inside and very warm,B0002NYVV4
"Completely as expected. Of course, I don't yet know about extended durability, but construction seems fine, colour is brilliant (hasn't yet been over-laundered, of course.. We'll see), size is as expected (slightly roomy, which is what I was aiming for), soft, substantial enough material.",B0002NYVV4
Fit and color were perfect!!!  Very comfortable!!  Would recommend!,B0002NYVV4
"The fit is good and the arms are long enough, even though I usually order a Tall size.  The only improvement I would like would be for the material to be a little thicker.",B0002NYVV4
The quality is really good! And they fit really nicely,B0002NYVV4
"While the fit on these sweatshirts is good, after wearing a couple of times, I noticed they ""pill"" easily. I am not sure I would purchase this brand again.",B0002NYVV4
"Having worn large sweatshirts for years, I finally decided I didn't want the ""baggy"" look anymore. I ordered Jerzees, because they offered plain sweatshirts in a large variety of colors. I ordered mediums. They're obviously smaller than what I wore before, but they're not too snug; they're comfortable. They're also lighter in weight, at least compared to my previous sweatshirts. They've turned out to be exactly what I hoped for.",B0002NYVV4
Basic sweatshirt. Very soft and true to size.,B0002NYVV4
Like the gift and the softness of the sweatshirt,B0002NYVV4
"Very nice sweatshirt for the price, fits well and washes well.",B0002NYVV4
SO COMFORTABLE!! Perfect sweatshirt for lounging around the house. Ive bought this item in several different colors!! :),B0002NYVV4
These are amazing! Over the next year I will be ordering plenty! WASH ALONE; FUZZ FROM THE INSIDE SPREADS,B0002NYVV4
"Fits perfeclty, hasn't shrunk, and doesn't get little fuzzy balls all over it when washed. Will buy again!",B0002NYVV4
"Ordered a small, Im a 59 and 145lbs girl and it fits a little loosely, which is just how I wanted it. Super soft on the inside.",B0002NYVV4
I am disappointed with this sweatshirt I got it. As it defective one sleeve is long then the another one.,B0002NYVV4
"three stars is probably generous. I washed it, I wore it, it pilled horribly.",B0002NYVV4
Nice shirt that fits fine.  I have bought several of these in different colors.,B0002NYVV4
JERZEES MEN'S NUBLEND CREW NECK SWEATSHIRT - I was looking for a lighter weight sweatshirt and this fits the bill!  love it!,B0002NYVV4
Super soft and comfy. The upper part of the sleeves are too baggy but it's not like I wear sweatshirts to look my best anyways.,B0002NYVV4
Very comfortable and true to size,B0002NYVV4
"It was somewhat larger than what I expected, and that is a good thing. If you are about just a larger or so, a medium would work for you perfectly without a problem. The color is nice and I used this to make a Bojack Horseman costume. It worked perfectly well.",B0002NYVV4
I love wearing this. It's my favorite cool weather clothing!,B0002NYVV4
"very large and baggy, except for in the length. Sweater could be 2 inches longer and fit would be fantastic. I'm 6'6"" and ordered the 3xl. It's baggy, but could be longer in the torso",B0002NYVV4
Ive gotten this s/shirt in 11 colors and each time its always on point! Ill keep buying these!,B0002NYVV4
Although a day late. That doesnt bother me. The fit is perfect. Love how the material feels on my skin. Definitely already buying a red one. Cant wait !,B0002NYVV4
Cant go wrong with comfortable sweats I distressed the top and bottom follow my business page for looks instagram divinequeens_,B0002NYVV4
I am doing an L cosplay and i needed a loose fitting white sweatshirt to complete the look,B0002NYVV4
I HIGHLY Recommend! GREAT product at a reasonable price.,B0002NYVV4
"Nice medium weight sweatshirt, perfect for layering.  No visible logos and the color is uniform.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice shirt, pretty color, good price !",B0002NYVV4
"It's a great product but too large.
It runs very large.  I bought it for me, but gave it to my large husband.  He is happy.",B0002NYVV4
The material is of a low quality,B0002NYVV4
Too big. Cant return it without paying $4.50!,B0002NYVV4
It's a plaint black sweatshirt.  It's fine. Let's not get all crazy about it.,B0002NYVV4
"Got for my boyfriend and they were super cute, I might get one for myself! Soft inside and looks amazing",B0002NYVV4
The shirt fit's just fine thanks.,B0002NYVV4
I bought this for my Mike Wazowski costume. It is the perfect green!,B0002NYVV4
Love this sweat shirt.  But may amend this review depending upon how well it holds up over time.,B0002NYVV4
"I really wish Jerzees would stop using those annoying tags!  Other than that, fine quality!  It has a good ""hand"" and feels very good.  The color is as shown, which is what I wanted.  The one I got was long enough, but a little too bulky in the middle (I was really going for the length as most important) so all in all I am quite pleased.  It washes well, very little shrinkage, and holds its shape quite well, so far.",B0002NYVV4
Awesome price for plus size and great quality!,B0002NYVV4
Great sweatshirt for the price. Heavy and durable looks and feels great. Thanks Jerzees and Amazon. Very satisfied. Looking sharp even when going casual!,B0002NYVV4
"love the comfort color and it is very warm,. will be buying more of the comfort colors.",B0002NYVV4
"Overall the shirt is on the thinner side, but rly nice for chilly weather that's not yet actually cold. The forest green is a little more vibrant than the picture but it's not a bad thing. Inside is rly soft but bound to wear out rly quick. They don't give you the torso length, but the overall length of the sweater is a couple inches shorter than the sleeve and so if you have a rly long torso like I do go for a bigger size because the sweatshirt barely ends by my waistline even tho the sleeves fit fine.",B0002NYVV4
"I have nothing but good things to say about this item and the seller. First of all its a 9 dollar sweatshirt so I wasn't expecting much but its actually amazing quality and I want more of them. So my favorite thing about sweatshirts are when they are soft/fuzzy inside and I didn't expect it from some random thing I found on amazon. Also as an extra thing, it got here 4 days before the expected shipment date. Thanks for a quality product guys.",B0002NYVV4
"Great for winter wear over a t-shirt or any shirt, or just by itself.",B0002NYVV4
Cute and comfy is really as much as I can say.,B0002NYVV4
"Nice but bigger than expected. I like floppy, but this maybe a 2x and not a 1x size?",B0002NYVV4
"Super high quality, i like it more than expensive brands,seriously!",B0002NYVV4
Perfect fit! Nice and warm in 35F weather. Super happy with this purchase!..,B0002NYVV4
It's too large. Not able to wear. Return policy also looks complex.,B0002NYVV4
Nice weight for working around house,B0002NYVV4
Its nice and comfy but a little big on the length of the arms,B0002NYVV4
Nice and soft. Larger than expected but still wears nicely.,B0002NYVV4
Need to pay half the price of the thing to return. Rather gift the seller a one star. Ridiculously large. Sleeves are even larger fit to my thigh. Can only act as a stupid pajama,B0002NYVV4
Very nice quality. Fit perfect.,B0002NYVV4
"It's comfortable, but the sleeves are way too big.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice quality, fairly heavy weight, but big.  I'm going to try to shrink it.  If you don't like baggy clothes that hang all over you, consider getting a size smaller, or maybe something else.",B0002NYVV4
I love it! Great quality and Its really soft on the inside!,B0002NYVV4
"Got the XL but the large would have been big enough. I like loose fitting sweat shirts but the XL was almost to big. Color is nice. Medium weight, not to heavy or to light, just right for around the house.",B0002NYVV4
I originally ordered the wrong color (sandstone) but the Seller let me return it without any problem.  I purchased the correct color and it fits great.,B0002NYVV4
I actually bought it for my wife and she just loves it the only problem is now she wants me to buy her two more so that means she is VERY satisfied!!! Thank you,B0002NYVV4
"A little thin and stiff, cotton causing that, but fits well, and with washing will loosen up a bit and perhaps fluff too. It's hard to find casual crews that one can wear outside the gym, this one works.  Good price point.",B0002NYVV4
"Lovee this sweater. I purchased two different colors(orange and pink). They are very comfortable,material is realllly nice,soft. Will definitely get another one.",B0002NYVV4
very nice.  love the color/good deal/,B0002NYVV4
"I'm 5""9 180lbs. Ordered the large . Fits great . Not too slim or baggy like some other mock shirts that I have purchased in the past. Can't wait to wear it when the cool fall whether arrives.",B0002NYVV4
love it. warm and soft. fits great.,B0002NYVV4
"It's not all bad, but wow, there is just way too much fabric under the armpit down the whole arm. When you raise your arms it's like a wingsuit - it's absurd. 3 stars because it's still very comfortable and the white is crisp, but cannot wear it outside the house unless you are in fact wingsuit base jumping.",B0002NYVV4
Very full sleeves from shoulder to pit...If you wear L I would recommend ordering a M...have not washed it yet. hope it will shrink...,B0002NYVV4
Not too thick sweatshirt. Perfect for cool mornings while waiting on school bus. Daughter loves it!,B0002NYVV4
The sweatshirt was just as I was wanting. Love wearing in the winter around the house.,B0002NYVV4
It was a bit wider than expected in the arms and torso but still very comfy. Didn't arrive with tag but was real Jerzees,B0002NYVV4
I got the light pink color in a size small. The sweatshirt is definitely baggy as expected but what I am unhappy about is how big and baggy the arm part is. The width of the sleeve is huge and makes the sweatshirt bulky in the arm area. I could fit 4 of my arms in the sleeve. I have just never had a crew neck with such baggy sleeves. Other than that issue it is extremely soft on the inside and nice color.,B0002NYVV4
It's just a light weight sweatshirt and will do fine for this fall.,B0002NYVV4
Very soft & fits perfectly. Color was exactly like the picture and I love it !! Only thing is he sleeves are a little baggies than I'd like but it's not to the point of annoyance.,B0002NYVV4
"Good sweatshirt. Should work out well.
We are using them for our HVAC for winter company attire.
Will be buying more.",B0002NYVV4
Not a really roomy or luxurious shirt but love the colors,B0002NYVV4
"Good quality, and is exactly what I thought it would be",B0002NYVV4
The size was a little bit bigger then what us said but it's alright cos I still looked good in it and the price was good so that's a plus,B0002NYVV4
Very comfortable - didn't shrink at all when washed. I'd buy another one!,B0002NYVV4
"I ordered 2 of these Jerzees sweatshirts and I love them.  They are soft and comfy and washed up beautifully with no shrinkage.  I'm 5'5"" and 160 lbs and wanted them roomy so I could layer under them in winter.  Got an xx-large and is perfect size, even plenty of room in the arms for a few lightweight shirts under.  I will be ordering a few more of these.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice Quality, fits well, I know nowhere I can get  my white jerzees, usually sold out in store , thanks",B0002NYVV4
"Little bigger in the torso than I expected, and, as I knew before I bought it, pretty short length compared to the width of the torso and sleeves.",B0002NYVV4
These are really nice for the price!!  I am very happy with the 4 I bought!,B0002NYVV4
"My 89-year-old father loves these shirts.  They are very comfortable for him, and he likes to wear them every day.  I have bought him six or seven of these in various colors.",B0002NYVV4
"Perfect fit. Not too thick, not too thin. Comfortable and light.",B0002NYVV4
Love the sweater! Comfortable and surprisingly did not shrink after drying it.,B0002NYVV4
"In comparison to other crew neck sweatshirts, these are the perfect loose fit and weight",B0002NYVV4
"Comfy, but it is see through, too long, and wide on both the arms and waist.",B0002NYVV4
Fits good ! Lots of heat ! Great quality !,B0002NYVV4
When they are under five dollars you will not find a better deal,B0002NYVV4
"Nice standard, well made, no frills, sweatshirt perfect for lounging in. I love oversized sweatshirts and these are an affordable and more sturdier alternative to the more expensive and trendy ones online.",B0002NYVV4
Not very good stitching at the seams.,B0002NYVV4
I get these all the time for sports with a logo and writing but I wanted a plain one so I ordered my own. Awesome!!,B0002NYVV4
Low quality. Fabric pills easily.,B0002NYVV4
"Soft, comfortable and fit well.",B0002NYVV4
"I read many reviews prior to buying this, as I need references for sizing since I'm a girl- 5'6, 130 pounds. I knew this wasn't made for women, but most women crewnecks don't fit correctly. I purchased a small, which was recommended by other buyers, and it's quite large. Being large around the abdomen is not problem, but it's mostly baggy around the arms. I might purchase an extra small if I bought another.",B0002NYVV4
Arrived on time. Color matches photo. Fits as expected. Lighter weight than many of my sweatshirts. Appears good quality  though the ultimate test of a sweatshirt is how it looks after a few trips through the wash  especially does it pill. All I can do on that is see.,B0002NYVV4
It's OK. It's actually somewhat brighter than the picture. Sleeves are really baggy. I reccomend the Hanes brand crew neck,B0002NYVV4
Best crew neck sweatshirt I have ever owned.,B0002NYVV4
"I bought this sweatshirt a month or two ago and have been absolutely obsessed with itin fact, I just ordered a second one in another color! The material is super comfortable, and it's easy to throw on over another shirt or just wear on its own. Highly recommend!",B0002NYVV4
Perfect for lounging around the house. Intentionally bought 1 size too big :-) . Very comfortable,B0002NYVV4
Excellent quality and fit.  Launders beautifully with no shrinkage.,B0002NYVV4
So glad I purchased this.  Great quality for price.,B0002NYVV4
Excellent sweatshirts- good fit - first one washed well - would purchase again,B0002NYVV4
"Love these sweatshirts!  Very good quality for a very good price.  I plan to order a couple more.
Wonderful selection of colors too.  I ordered a medium size as I am a 5' 0"" female.  They are a
bit roomy, but I like them that way especially if I wear a turtle neck shirt underneath.",B0002NYVV4
"At first I was a little hesitant on buying this, just because $10 for a sweatshirt seemed a little odd to me. When I received it, I was extremely surprised by the quality of it. I ordered a small (I'm 5'7, 130 pounds), and I found it to fit almost perfectly! The sleeves are a bit baggy, but it is definitely still comfortable. This has by far become my favorite thing to wear. I highly recommend purchasing this!!",B0002NYVV4
This is a medium-weight sweatshirt. Not too heavy or too thin. I needed a green sweatshirt!,B0002NYVV4
"These are nice and soft and comfy, the only thing is they shrunk some in the wash. They are now shorter in length and tighter around. This surprises us as these are usually the ones we buy and don't normally have a problem. They quality has always been good, but not great on these.",B0002NYVV4
Excellent quality. Will buy again. They wear very well.,B0002NYVV4
"the size is fit what I expected, but the length(?) is short.",B0002NYVV4
Your Jerzees XL is smaller than other same size brands......Bob H.,B0002NYVV4
"Fits true to normal sizes, can't wait to have it monogrammed.",B0002NYVV4
"You can't buy a better light-weight sweat shirt for the price.  Fits well, launders well.",B0002NYVV4
super comfy and the material is super soft.,B0002NYVV4
"Runs a little larger than actual size, unless you like your sweatshirts roomy. I don't.  No problems returning though.  Hassle free.",B0002NYVV4
"This shirt was fine, decent quality, especially for the very fair price.",B0002NYVV4
"Quality was as expected. But chose size based on reviews. Item was way too big, even after  washing in hot water and machine drying. Next time I will order a medium.",B0002NYVV4
"For what it is, it's fine.  Polyester sweatshirt.  Fit okay.  Looks okay.  Color did not bleed after washing.  Did not shrink in dryer.  Hard to get excited over a sweatshirt.  But nothing ""wrong"" with it. I would purchase again in different colors, for sure.",B0002NYVV4
"I cannot say enough about this sweatshirt!  Great fit, great quality and great price!  (A 2X fits like a 2X should!) I purchased it to have a family of deer embroidered on it and it looks awesome!  Would order again in different colors!!",B0002NYVV4
"I ordered the maroon in a size small in mens that came this morning and its not small nor big its a little roomy thatll look just right on anyone! I also just ordered 3 more and I know theyll be just as great as my first one.

Update: My 3 sweaters came a few days early and they are very comfortable and snug! Thankyou so much I will be ordering more soon! ",B0002NYVV4
Shrunk to a small medium after first wash,B0002NYVV4
"i did not expect this quality for the price.  It's my new ""uniform"" for days at home- soft and compfy.",B0002NYVV4
The quality of the shirt was great but I ordered the wrong size.,B0002NYVV4
Great value! Super soft and cozy basic sweatshirt fits great and love the neutral color.,B0002NYVV4
"just so-so

i will give it a 7 out of 10",B0002NYVV4
Received item as described.  Thank you!,B0002NYVV4
very comfortable--sleeves a little big.,B0002NYVV4
The pink on here looks lighter or more pale than what it is in person. Might bleach it or something? Just not what was expected.,B0002NYVV4
"Nice quality, but a little small for my husband.  Should have gotten larger size.",B0002NYVV4
Great sweatshirt for the price. Not extremely thick but nice soft poly blend material.,B0002NYVV4
"Soft and simple, bought this in Tuscan Orange and is true to color. Would definitely buy more in different colors in the future :)",B0002NYVV4
Great sweatshirt!!! Fits perfectly.,B0002NYVV4
"Very nice sweater, warm and comfy. Inexpensive which is nice!",B0002NYVV4
i ordered it two days ago and it's already here! very happy with the color and the size. i got a large because i wanted it to be oversized and it's exactly what i wanted. would recommend!,B0002NYVV4
"Not 100 percent cotton, but seems durable. Bought for my mom and it looks good on her. Pink is her color.",B0002NYVV4
Fit nice soft and great quality,B0002NYVV4
"comfortable roomy and bright,  good price also",B0002NYVV4
Love the shirts. I wear them all the time. They feel great !!!,B0002NYVV4

"Warm, fits well.  Just what I was looking for.",B0002NYVV4
Perfect for the price.  Great company to work with.  Will definitely purchase more.,B0002NYVV4
i;m a  fan of the jerzees brand.,B0002NYVV4
Great shirt. Does not fade. Washes well,B0002NYVV4
I was looking for a thicker (overall) and  roomier sleeves and some tight-y elastic waist and cuffs in a sweatshirt and found this. Its not exactly thick. Its lightweight but comfortable. I love this sweatshirt and bought a couple more in different colors.,B0002NYVV4
"Super comfy sweatshirt, and a great price",B0002NYVV4
"Very nice, good weight, soft and fluffy... enjoying them.",B0002NYVV4
It was ok but it was really wrinkled and I had a hard time getting the wrinkles out.,B0002NYVV4
"Fits well, it's warm and green. Can't ask for too much more out of this reasonably priced item.",B0002NYVV4
Very nice.  Highly visible and soft.,B0002NYVV4
"This sweatshirt is not a sweatshirt, it is super thin and does not look or feel like it is described. I have been looking for a sweatshirt that I can wear every day and also be able to screenprint on it. The image does not look like what the product received looks like, black heather looks more like heather gray, which is very disappointing.",B0002NYVV4
Love this sweater fits as expected too and it's very soft on the inside if you want yours to be a little bigger get a a size up I'm 5'2 and weigh 100 pounds so I got a medium. I love this highly recommend,B0002NYVV4
"Not the heaviest Jerzee sweatshirt around, but it is made well and the price was a bargain. The fit is somewhat large so I tried to shrink it by washing in hot water and drying it on high heat; however, there was very little shrinkish. Overall I pleased with this purchase.",B0002NYVV4
So cozy and perfect size love it me and my daughter twining,B0002NYVV4
Fits great! Very comfortable I would suggest getting 1 size smaller than you actually are.,B0002NYVV4
"Not like the older ones. Hadn't bought this brand for a long time and quality not nearly what it once was. Not bad, but better choices available.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice Color, fits nicely, lightweight.",B0002NYVV4
"really like it color is perfect, fits good.",B0002NYVV4
"It's a good, light-weight sweat shirt. Nice for around the house or sleeping in. 4 stars vice 5 because the cuffs have loose threads. Finish could be neater.",B0002NYVV4
The medium size fit me quite well.  Will consider purchasing more in the future.  Good Purchase.,B0002NYVV4
Great sweatshirt and a very nice pink. Washes well and doesn't shrink. Looks great and can be drsssed up with a polo or button down. Buy this one.,B0002NYVV4
"Good, cheap around the house sweatshirt. Fits great.",B0002NYVV4
Fits a little tight but nice feeling sweatshirt.  Might go a size larger next time. Anxious to see how it holds up to washing etc.,B0002NYVV4
"I was at my dad's house and borrowed one of his sweatshirts - liked it so much I ordered this one (same brand).  It was a little larger than expected, but I washed it on the hot water setting, and it shrunk just enough to fit nicely.  This is a good quality, thick sweatshirt - but also soft.",B0002NYVV4
it is exactly as described. Very nice. I just ordered  a size too big.,B0002NYVV4
Loved it except it was larger than what I was thought... therefore gave it as gift to someone else =),B0002NYVV4
fit perfect. good quality. soft.,B0002NYVV4
"a little bit big, but overall good product. I would strongly recommend.",B0002NYVV4
"My Father-in-Law asks for a hoodless sweatshirt every year for Christmas since that's basically all he ever wears in the winter. We go with Jerzees because it has been difficult to find sweatshirts without hoods from other brands, especially if you want a particular color. He prefers rich earth tones most of the time (this year was the exception and he simply wanted grey), and Jerzees has a good selection of colors. It's soft and heavy enough to be warm on its own but perfect for layering during cold Wisconsin winters. We definitely will buy more of these in the future -- good quality at a great price.",B0002NYVV4
"i should of gotten a extra large, But I am wearing it.",B0002NYVV4
"Super comfy! I love this crewneck. Great to wear to class, to the gym, or even just to lounge in. The sleeves are somewhat on the larger size and can make the sweat shirt appear puffy, but hey it's a sweatshirt.",B0002NYVV4
Nice sweatshirt fit as expected,B0002NYVV4
"Comfortable. Looks good, washed well.",B0002NYVV4
Fits as expected.  Even after washing them,B0002NYVV4
This oversized sweatshirt is fabulous! So many colors to choose from and I want them all. The material is comfortable and the price is right!,B0002NYVV4
It's somehow designed too large... I've ordered medium and it's like XL ..,B0002NYVV4
i didn't get what the description said i would get . don't buy this . its not worth it .,B0002NYVV4
"Got this for a Halloween costume, was absolutely awesome.",B0002NYVV4
"Wrong Color, Way too big, scratchy. Size down or find a different sweater. Hope the color doesn't matter either.",B0002NYVV4
Fits as described.  Good weight sweatshirt..,B0002NYVV4
"was as expected, just what I wanted.",B0002NYVV4
No return label or cost.  Very unhappy,B0002NYVV4
Color true to picture & fits well & fabric is great!,B0002NYVV4
"Fits great, came in perfect time.",B0002NYVV4
Wish I could give minus stars for this jerzee. It's too wide and short. Designer must've thought of a big stomach. I'll clean my kitchen floor with this. Thank you,B0002NYVV4
Its good i like it. But let's just say if i was to order it again I'll get a xxl just because i would preffer it looser and the xl fits me fitted. (Okay so i did order it a second time this time xxl in jet black just because i thought jet black would be a darker black but it still looked the sameish as the regular black so i paid a bit more for nothing just because the size also it feels the same but the. It doesn't and i feel like the sleeves are just baggier. It's all good i will still be wearing the sweater it's still fresh.,B0002NYVV4
"Received1&1/2 weeks early
So thankful needed it for a costume
Excellent!!",B0002NYVV4
Such an amazing sweatshirt. I'm 5 ft 4 in and 169 lbs and I got a large. Fits big and is long enough to cover your behind.,B0002NYVV4
A bit more blousey in the sleeves than I would have liked but a nice sweatshirt overall.,B0002NYVV4
Loved the quality. Great price. Ordered a second one of the same kind. A sure value. Was not disappointed!,B0002NYVV4
"Fit well...color was not good...returned it and am getting another. Site is difficult because it does not show all the colors at once, You have to click on each one to see the color, and cannot easily compare colors",B0002NYVV4
"Color was perfect, I was expecting it to be a little bigger but I'm fine with that. It fits perfectly. :)",B0002NYVV4
Great sweater fits somewhat large,B0002NYVV4
"Great sweatshirt in every respect. Colour was just as pictured and the fit is exactly what I was looking for ---- roomy without being too oversized.
Super soft inside & very well-made overall. Thoroughly happy with this purchase & plan to order a few more in various colours.
I highly recommend it!",B0002NYVV4
"great sweatshirt, very comfy against skin, soft and nice color.  thanks",B0002NYVV4
Fit too baggy on the arms and the color was lighter than expected. But the material seemed nice enough and the seller I bought it from gave me a full refund no problem.,B0002NYVV4
"Nice, have a med. on order. When I find the right fit I plan on ordering more. The sleeves are a little too full.",B0002NYVV4
"This color is so nice and bright. The sweater is extremely warm and soft and the color hurts your eyes in a "" i want to stand out"" kind of way. I wear it with jeans and some vans and the contrast is good. I am usually a S/M and got this size and it fits a bit big but like an oversize sweatshirt how I wanted.",B0002NYVV4
"Great sweatshirt, very comfortable, will buy more in different colors",B0002NYVV4
Good quality.  Fit and washed well.,B0002NYVV4
"It's just ""okay"".  I think the neck opening is too large as well as the length of the arms but it's a good item for a good price.",B0002NYVV4
"Made well, good quality,  but.....  I've worn a Medium for the last 40 years.  This Medium fit like an XLarge.",B0002NYVV4
Wish it was just a little larger but otherwise nice shirt. This is a lightweight sweat.,B0002NYVV4
"I bought this shirt for a cosplay I was working on (Frisk from Undertale) and it was the PERFECT color. I ordered a large (since I like my sweatshirts extra baggy) and it was HUGE. I usually fit larger running smalls and mediums, but I would definitely recommend to order a size down for a conform fit or your usual size if you like baggy sweatshirts. Other than that, I was pleased with the quality and softness for the first couple of washes, and it works well with fabric paint, though it has started to ball from friction underneath the armpits now (hence 4 stars instead of five...). That may have been a result of my washing machine, but I'm not entirely sure, so I recommend washing in cold/delicate cycles.",B0002NYVV4
"Very thin material and undersized for the ""medium"" fit",B0002NYVV4
"This sweatshirt is soo comfy. I ordered a size small and wanted it to be a bit roomy, which it is. It's really soft on the inside and I can layer a bunch of clothes underneath as well. The forest green color is very pretty, and I was worried if it would come out as an ugly forest green - but it's a true deep green color, and it's not that dark either. I'd defiantly want to purchase different colors later on. It's held up really well, so I probably won't need to for a while. AND, it doesn't shrink!",B0002NYVV4
I own about 15 of these in different colors and they are my staple for Fall and Winter. I purposely order sizes larger than I need so they are even more comfortable. Also a good price and good quality.,B0002NYVV4
GREAT VALUE  NICE SWEATSHIRT  ACTUAL AS EXPECTED,B0002NYVV4
Ordered 2 of the same color received 2 different colors-,B0002NYVV4
"I like this sweatshirt.  It fit well, and after washing it several times, I am pleased with the quality.  I would purchase it again.",B0002NYVV4
"A good light sweat shirt, washes and wears well.  Great colors. It will keep you warm on chilly spring nights,  Amazon has a full line of them, I bought two.",B0002NYVV4
"Huge sleeves, Baggy sleeves, don't buy unless you see it first.",B0002NYVV4
I wear a lot of pink because I am a breast cancer survivor.  This fits well and lets me feel so comfortable in it.,B0002NYVV4
Exactly what I ordered and what I wanted!,B0002NYVV4
"I ordered it 2 sizes large because I've been really into that aesthetic recently. Looks great with skinny jeans or slim joggers! The sleeves are pretty wide, so I have to watch myself when I go out to eat. Very soft and warm too, it's an all around great sweatshirt for a nice price!",B0002NYVV4
Excellent product and beautiful color,B0002NYVV4
Couldnt find a plain white sweatshirt in any Walmart or target.  This worked well for Halloween,B0002NYVV4
"This is as advertised , works for me.",B0002NYVV4
Its amazing. It came 2 days after i ordered it which was much earlier than expected and a wonderful surprise. The color and quality of the shirt also turned out to be what i hoped when i ordered it. I highly recommend it,B0002NYVV4
two of the best seat shirts I have ever purchased. A great price and very good quality .extremely soft .,B0002NYVV4
"Order 1 size larger than needed. Otherwise, the product is fine.",B0002NYVV4
Great fit and i love the way it looks on me. Took me few years to find a sweater like this with out a hoodie.,B0002NYVV4
"comfy, but not so much of a gabric",B0002NYVV4
"Light weight sweatshirt. The large IS a large as it should be. Bought a Hanes large, not nearly as generous , or as long, as this is.",B0002NYVV4
"Love it! I got the baby pink and it's such a beautiful color! I love oversized sweatshirts for cooler days, and this one is very comfortable and lightweight for those cooler spring days. Im glad I didn't go for anything over XL because it would have been too big. The XL is the perfect oversized sweatshirt for me and I'm able to layer under if needed. Will probably be getting the baby blue in the near future.",B0002NYVV4
"My go to shirt when I don't feel like thinking too much of what to wear, hehe. A bit on the larger size so order two sizes down. I have it in XXXL, XXL and now I think XL is more my size. It's comfy  though so I liked it. The inner fabric is a lint producer though.",B0002NYVV4
great product and hard to find in stores...Thank you.,B0002NYVV4
"Color is really beautiful.  So brilliant, it can be viewed by extraterrestrials light years away.  Love it.  Keeps you warm and cuddly feeling too.",B0002NYVV4

Nice material and it fits good !,B0002NYVV4
Cosssssey...love it.  Good fabric...good fit.  Soft.,B0002NYVV4
Love the sweatshirt.  It's a little large but I order them that way in case there's shrinkage.  It's polyester so I needn't have worried.  Almost past the season for sweatshirts but there's always next year!!!,B0002NYVV4
Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! I need to buy him more. They are so comfortable and soft. After having it for 5 months it is still in great shape!,B0002NYVV4
"Lightweight, soft and warm, great for lounging around the house on cold winter days.",B0002NYVV4
"I ordered the dark grey sweatshirt, and when it came to me, I got the light grey one. Wasn't a big deal, I actually like the light grey better. I'm a women, 5""5' and i ordered a small. It's over sized on me but I expected that and its so cute. Love this shirt.",B0002NYVV4
Great value - exactly as advertised,B0002NYVV4
Disappointed with the quality of the fabric - too light.,B0002NYVV4

Fits properly and love the color.,B0002NYVV4
"Nice, light weight sweatshirt.  I ordered a medium but it could pass as a large.",B0002NYVV4
Ordered 2 for my dad and they are of good quality.  Jerzee brand has never disappointed.,B0002NYVV4
Nice sweatshirt. My husband loved it. Very basic but comfortable,B0002NYVV4
Perfect fit and the color is brilliant.,B0002NYVV4
Soft and fits to size.  Love the fact that it is 50/50.,B0002NYVV4
"Fit as expected , Everything was as i wanted",B0002NYVV4
Worn while biking. A little large but that is good since it allows for layering on blustery days.,B0002NYVV4
"All three were just what we were looking for and am quite satisfied.  Will probably order some again in the future.

Thanks",B0002NYVV4
Really like the quality of the product but I do usually need 2xl for sweaters and sweat shirts and these seem to run big compared to other products.  They do not shrink when washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer.,B0002NYVV4
Plan to buy another.  Great fit and cozy comfort wear,B0002NYVV4
Just right fit good feeling will buy again.,B0002NYVV4
"This sweatshirt is really comfy and fits as expected. The color is deep and nice, and it retained its color and still fits after washing.",B0002NYVV4
fits great looks good.  Very comfortable on cold winter days,B0002NYVV4
Heavier material than expected but will work for cold winter days.,B0002NYVV4
"Kind of big and bulky for a Large and not the best quality, but warm and comfortable for wearing around the house.",B0002NYVV4
Great material and for warmth and softness.,B0002NYVV4
Comfy and fuzzy on the inside fits the way I wanted though I got it bigger size cause I wanted bigger sleeves,B0002NYVV4
"Have been wearing the same Jerzees sweatshirt to work in the yard for years...I mean years! I decided it was time for a new one so I bought this. I think the first one was a little heavier when it was new but this one is still a nice medium weight. Time will tell, but it washed up nice and fits well. I'll probably get more in different colors to wear with jeans.",B0002NYVV4
"I ordered this for my dad, and he loved it!!Will order again!!",B0002NYVV4
Terribly big! I hated it. Spend the $40 and by an American Apparel sweatshirt.,B0002NYVV4
"Boy, you can't go wrong with this shirt, price is perfect as is the feel.",B0002NYVV4
Love this old school sweat shirt. Nice warm comfortable fit.,B0002NYVV4
"I am very happy with everything about the shirt except for the fullness of the upper arms.  On the website where I ordered the shirt, the picture used showed that the upper arms were more fitted.  In doing this review, the image presented now shows a true depiction of the shirt.  (Because I sew this is not too much of a problem.)  Otherwise, I am VERY satisfied with the shirt.  I already ordered and received 3 more; will probably order another.  I only wish that the correct image was shown originally for a true representation.",B0002NYVV4
"No problem with the sweatshirt, been looking for a brown one for a long time.",B0002NYVV4
Very warm! Fits exactly as I expected and arrived a day early!,B0002NYVV4
Very nice material not a flimsy thin material! Colors were perfect will absolutely buy more.,B0002NYVV4
Great quality.  Fantastic price!,B0002NYVV4
Your shirts and sweat pants are delicious  . I bought five sets for my husband to lounge around the house. They always look clean and fresh.,B0002NYVV4
Very comfortable.  Great price.,B0002NYVV4
"Bought this because my husband wanted a WHITE sweatshirt for when he was painting houses.  Fit was great, material was good and it was warm enough too.  Good quality for an inexpensive sweatshirt.",B0002NYVV4
"Really comfy, super soft. I love it, I'm gonna buy another one. I bought a blue one to use for my Frisk cosplay, and I'm going to buy a bright green one for my Chara cosplay. I highly recommend it. :)",B0002NYVV4
Gave to my husband for Christmas and he likes it.  Nice and soft.,B0002NYVV4
It is not a heavyweight sweat shirt. It helps me stay warmer than just a long sleeve polo shirt I have under it.  This color is unique to my department at work.,B0002NYVV4
"Very nice sweatshirt, ordered 2 for my brother. He lives them. Very sift and comfy, well made. Good price",B0002NYVV4
"Sweatshirt on point, baggy relaxed fit && that pale pink got me lookin on point",B0002NYVV4
BRILLIANT COLOR and fabric is plush!,B0002NYVV4
"It is a ""short"" sweatshirt. The arm length is good, but the body of the shirt barely hits my waist (5'11""). After just one wash the shirt was pilling pretty significantly. By the second wash, the shirt just looks too cheap to wear in public.",B0002NYVV4
I bought a large Men's to give to my mom .,B0002NYVV4
"Hard to find a all white plain shirt, it's great.",B0002NYVV4
Recipient likes the set ... would have been perfect if it had a pocket.  Thanks.,B0002NYVV4
"Says ""100% Cotton"" and that's why I ordered it.  Received the sweat shirt today and the tag says ""50/50."" Therefore, I re-read the online description to find out how I screwed up.  Well, it appears, I have a case of premature cottonosis.  The first line of the description says ""100% cotton"" and that's where I stopped reading in my stupor of irrational exuberance in finding a 100% cotton sweat shirt.  In all fairness, I can speculate the description is less than false advertising as the 50% cotton content is made from 100% cotton.  Yeah, that's it.",B0002NYVV4
sweatshirt is nice but the sleeve is long; so it would probably not work for a short person.,B0002NYVV4
It's exactly what you see in the photo. It's blue and fits.,B0002NYVV4
"Love Jerzees sweatshirts. Nice color, nice material and long wearing. Minimal shrinkage on both Nublend and the heavier cotton. Very consistent with their product line material over the years. I have machine embroidered on these with no issues. When they get older I simply convert them to zippered jackets for hiking.",B0002NYVV4
I bought these for a friend and he thought they were on the large size. Nice sweatshirt over all at a good price.,B0002NYVV4
Good quality and fits true to size,B0002NYVV4
"Somewhat large, but otherwise what I expected.",B0002NYVV4
Bought this for a DIY Halloween costume and it worked just fine.,B0002NYVV4
Very good for winter or good to wear in bed.,B0002NYVV4
"Excellent Quality.  As a result I've purchased more.  I've enjoyed each of these ordered.  However, you might let the seamstresses know the knit cuffs and waist bands have a 100% stretch rather than the 25-50% stretch of the body of the garment, therefore come out very large on the cuff and waist and do not fit as well as they should.",B0002NYVV4
The Jerzees sweatshirt fit as expected and is an excellent product in both quality and workmanship.,B0002NYVV4
Needed to dye these for a for a Halloween costume that sweats were not available in the color at all. Comfy and Exactly what I needed! Picked up color very well.,B0002NYVV4
I love this sweatshirt! Love the fit and color. I will be ordering more of these for the winter months!,B0002NYVV4
"Very large thru shoulders, some what snug thru bust. Sizing information gave a ""20"" inch across measurement, but didn't say where to measure. I thought it might shrink after going thru the dry but didn't. By the way - bought for a female who likes a loose fit. Maybe not quite this loose. OK for around the house so I'll keep trying. Color and weight were as expected.",B0002NYVV4
The sleeves are big enough to fit your thigh,B0002NYVV4
"Whether I'm out and about or lounging around, this sweatshirt looks great and fits comfortably. It was exactly what I was looking for, and coast less than $12. Definitely a great deal and a great buy.",B0002NYVV4
"This sweatshirt is everything I imagined it to be.  It is warm, soft on the inside and the color is just right.
I would recommend this to a friend.",B0002NYVV4
Great product for a great price.,B0002NYVV4
Bought a medium and it easily fit a friend who was a Large.,B0002NYVV4
Not white.  More of a silver or light gray.  But otherwise just fine.,B0002NYVV4
These are my favorite sweatshirt ever. Really soft.,B0002NYVV4
It looks like a really big cape that if I wear on winter it will probably lift me from the ground,B0002NYVV4
gift for my grandson and he loves it----warm & fuzzy----go for it,B0002NYVV4
Good product that fits my needs.,B0002NYVV4
Soft and comfortable sweatshirt with great color.,B0002NYVV4

"Great Quality Product, Fit as expected.",B0002NYVV4
Runs a bit large. Feels a little too loose. Needs to be fitted but that's the risk you run when you buy clothes online.,B0002NYVV4
"A little bit more larger than I expected, but that makes it even comfier. Great quality!",B0002NYVV4
"Needed a white sweatshirt for a cosplay, so ordered from the same brand that makes my work uniform sweatshirt (super comfortable) and got a great product. No complaints.",B0002NYVV4
fits the bill; looks good; wears nice,B0002NYVV4
"Ordered a 1X  -  got an XLarge, not the same thing. Will do but not what I wanted",B0002NYVV4
i just moved and i would have needed to go all the way across town to find these . they fit perfect . thanks.,B0002NYVV4
My husband loves this sweatshirt.  Exactly what he wanted,B0002NYVV4
"Beautiful shirt, fits as expected.",B0002NYVV4
Material didn't feel as sturdy as other sweat shirts I have purchased but for the price have kept and am using it.,B0002NYVV4
"soft, comfortable, does not wear out, does not shrink. It does not get better than that :0)",B0002NYVV4
It was Christmas and I could not find a Forest Green sweatshirt anywhere to paint on!  Thank goodness for Amazon!  The sweatshirt was a perfect forest green color and was well made.  Very pleased with this purchase.,B0002NYVV4
"Very nice fit. Great color, washes well.",B0002NYVV4
Disappointed at how quickly the fabric pilled up (after just a few washes).  Would not buy again.,B0002NYVV4
Okay.  I wouldn't buy another but it was ok and arrived promptly and in good shape.,B0002NYVV4
Beautiful color that has not faded.  Good quality.,B0002NYVV4
"Comfortable and a good fit, but tends to develop fabric pills quickly.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice Red color,  hasn't faded when washed...just what my husband wanted.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice, but oversized.  Recommend ordering one size smaller than normal.",B0002NYVV4
Great sweatshirt !  love the deep purple.,B0002NYVV4
"I do not like the neck or cuffs on this sweatshirt.  Loose and sloppy and stretch out even more.  The shirt does have nice material and is soft, but the neck and cuffs ruin it for me.",B0002NYVV4
This shirt was the exact color and size I looked for.,B0002NYVV4
This is high quality and was perfect for my Halloween costume. I need to order more!,B0002NYVV4
Bought as a gift.  They loved it and fits true to size!!!,B0002NYVV4
"Fit and feel is good, planning on buying more soon!",B0002NYVV4
I bought this sweatshirt as a gift. It is an attractive well made sweatshirt and was well received by the recipient.,B0002NYVV4
"Very soft, inside material like a baby blanket. Fit is like a 40-42, I tried to shrink in hot water and long drying, no shrinkage.  OK as loose fit.",B0002NYVV4
I orders this as a men's adult.small and what came wouldn't fit a five year old,B0002NYVV4
Love the color.  The material is kind of lightweight for a sweatshirt.  Color is vibrant.,B0002NYVV4
Bought for my teenage son - fits perfectly.,B0002NYVV4
Good fit for construction work.,B0002NYVV4
LARGE...JUST AS I WISHED FOR....GREAT VALUE. THANKS,B0002NYVV4
"I had an old Jerzees sweatshirt that fit perfectly, and was made in the USA.  This one has a fit similar to a competitor, too long in the sleeve and too baggy.  They changed their standard sizing, which had more of an athletic fit before, and no longer make it in the USA.  A bit of a disappointment.  Also, after first wear, my white t-shirt was covered with blue fibers.  Might as well just go with an easier to find competitor.",B0002NYVV4
Good quality. Fits good. True to size.,B0002NYVV4
"I am pretty nit-picky about sweatshirts....There are awesome for the price & I love the fit.  I have wide shoulders & they fit great.  I order a size up to be safe so when after 1st wash they shrink a little but then don't shrink any further (but honestly, that is my preference.....if you order your true size, they will fit perfect after 1 wash & they won't shrink more)!

Amazon - ONE OF THE FEW COMPANIES IN THE WORLD that TRULY cares about the customer (& I would say in a class by itself)....oh & you get better prices than any store including any S&H, Tax, etc.!!  So worth it!!!!  I honestly think it's silly not to purchase pretty much anything you can if available at AMZN - but again, personal preference.",B0002NYVV4
50/50 Sweat Shirt fits good over Black T-Shirts and keep me warm.,B0002NYVV4
I ordered a man's large because I'm making a patchwork jacket and it needed to be roomy. Nice material and weight.,B0002NYVV4
"Arrived in a week and a half! It was super white and comfortable to wear. It has a soft inside. On me, a 4'11"" 115 pound woman, the sleeves were long and it went to my butt. Perfect",B0002NYVV4
Wearing these constantly this winter.  I bought three of these and have worn them incessantly throughout the unending winter in the northeast.  Makes the winter weather bearable.,B0002NYVV4
shrunk the first time I washed it and didn't even put it in the clothes dryer,B0002NYVV4
"Good sweatshirt.  Used for a Halloween costume and now just wear it during workouts, etc.",B0002NYVV4
"Great item, very happy with this purchase.",B0002NYVV4
"Fabric is good, no swrinkage at all. Fit is as ecpected.",B0002NYVV4
Love them fit is great ...colors are great and have not faded.,B0002NYVV4
"Executive Summary: I waited to post this for almost a year to confirm the results, which remain unchanged from my original conclusion.  I ordered all of the shirts below and meticulously tried them on and measured them.  The Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Fleece Crewneck fit the best and has held up well.  The Champion Eco Fleece Crew fit the second best and has also held up well.  The Russell is baggier than the Champion, which is why it fits best for me.  The rest of them aren't even worth trying.  For the data below, all shirts were size large except the Carhartt.  All measurements are in inches without overly stretching the material.  Note that even a slight difference in sleeve width is a huge different in the bagginess of the overall sleeve.  Especially when the length of the sleeve itself is longer.

"I hardly ever see tops in baby blue so when I happened to see Jerzees Adult NuBlend Crew Neck Sweatshirt in S, Light Blue, I purchased it, on the spot.  It has a thick layer of fleece  and has that lovable soft, warm, and safe quality that I have associated with sweatshirts since I was a little girl.  Thanks, Bodek & Rhodes, for offering a large assortment of colors and sizes in athletic
clothing at your online store.",B0002NYVV4
Very nice sweatshirt. Roomy and warm.,B0002NYVV4

"Just what i expected, a nice lightweight sweatshirt, color good.. uncomplicated.",B0002NYVV4
This was a little large but I wanted it oversized so it was great.  It's long enough to wear with leggings and not have my behind hanging out. The inside is very soft and even after a few washings it's still so soft against my skin. I wear it a lot.,B0002NYVV4
It's very comfy and warm. Love the texture!,B0002NYVV4
The shirt is perfect.  It came right away.  I wear it all the time.  Jerzees is the best co.,B0002NYVV4

FOR THE PRICE IT'S A GREAT SHIRT,B0002NYVV4
"I couldn't find these anywhere online until I found them for men. Very soft,don't shrink and wide around chest and shoulders. They're a little big but I don't care. I wear a Ladies XL or XXL. I ordered mens XL.  A large would have fit better. but they're good for the price.",B0002NYVV4
Fits Perfect and is worn during the colder months!,B0002NYVV4
Nice and comfy. It will keep you warm for the winter.,B0002NYVV4

Fit was just right and seems to be well made.,B0002NYVV4
I actually bought this for my Mom who loves it because the cuffs are tight and it is very comfy.,B0002NYVV4
"Luckily. I bought this for a Halloween costume, and the fact that it fits large was a good thing. But beware that the arms fit extremely big.",B0002NYVV4

Perfect in the arm length. But I wish it was longer on the body. An extra 3 inches would be perfect,B0002NYVV4
I prefer Jerzees brand and can't find it locally.  I'm happy with the shirt and happy to have a new source.,B0002NYVV4

It was surprisingly comfortable and warm (and I was sad to have to cut off the sleeves to adhere to my costume).",B0002NYVV4
I always bought Jerzees sweatshirts and they fit me perfect but this time the sweatshirt was huge in the arm and hung sloppy looking. It seems that they made them differently this year. I was very disappointed in the fit.,B0002NYVV4

large than a medium. I have bought Jerzees in the past and
medium were fine even though I am short and small. I would
go with a small if I was to purchase another.",B0002NYVV4
The sweatshirt is excellent for the price I paid and just right for to wear for kicking around the house or in the yard on a cool day.,B0002NYVV4
"Quality was as expected, but the fit was larger than expected.",B0002NYVV4
I ordered a large even though I'm not that big. After washing the fit in the shoulders was tight and the sleeves were too short. I wouldn't buy another.,B0002NYVV4
"love this sweater, its so soft and nice really good material, really good sweater, only thing bad is i tried to take of the tag but it ripped a little bit but otherwise i love it",B0002NYVV4
"I bought three of these crew necks for school and the are wonderful!! I'm shorter (5'1"") and I got a medium and there perfect for something comfy and baggy to where to school in the fall and winter.",B0002NYVV4
"Love this sweater it is so comfortable, and cozy. I bought this sweater and expected okay quality but it's great. I would recommend!",B0002NYVV4
"i really like this sweatshirt ,,the color was qood ,,,& the it was qood quality,,ii just made the mistake & qot a biqqer size than usual so it was really biq on me,,,other than that its perfect,!",B0002NYVV4
It's a really comfortable sweater for a great price! I made a cross galaxy sweater with this and it turned out great!,B0002NYVV4
It fit well and did worked well for my project. Thank you for the accuracy of the size on the internet.,B0002NYVV4
It was an exact replica of the one I had lost. It went on well and the color was the one that I had chosen as well. I would definitely buy from here again.,B0002NYVV4
Really nice quality sweater. I tie dyed mine and it turned out wonderful. Nice and warm. Nice and simple. Buy it.,B0002NYVV4
I was looking for well fitting jerzees and I expected this fit perfectly. So I think the fit and the price are right. I may even buy some more.,B0002NYVV4
Good quality.  Soft and perfect fit.  It is my favorite! Very happy with this purchase from Amazon. Best deal for sweatshirt.,B0002NYVV4
"LOVE THESE SWEATSHIRTS. GREAT FOR WHEN ITS COLD WITH A BEANIE AND SOME BOOTS. MEDIUM ARE A LITTLE BAGGIE BUT  DONT REALLY MIND. I ORDERED THESE IS 3 OTHER COLORS SINCE I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. GREAT BUY, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. WILL DEFINITELY KEEP YOU WARM.",B0002NYVV4
"My husband works construction and I bought these for him to wear on the job.  They are very light, and not really tough enough for a hard day's work.

If you like a lightweight sweatshirt, then these are for you!  They look to be a good value, and you can't beat the price.",B0002NYVV4
It fits a little large but that's what I wanted. I'm using it as a pajama top on cold nights. It is warm and I like the price.,B0002NYVV4
The sizing is definitely for a man.  My mother is a small woman and it was way too big for her.,B0002NYVV4
"Okay.  I have not washed it yet. Or else I would have given it five 5 stars.

Good Buy!

wally",B0002NYVV4
"I'm a woman and expected the small to be a little big.  It is, its fits more like a women's medium/small large, which is fine.  It's very comfy.  Also the white is blindingly white.  Nothing super special but just what I wanted.",B0002NYVV4
"I have bought this brand in the past and have been very satisfied.  The Jerzee brand does not ""pill"" up when washed and maintains the ""new"" look for a long time.",B0002NYVV4
Sizing is true to fit.  Well made w/just enough elasticity in ribbed wrist area to keep sleeves in place if pushed up and returns to size if pulled back to the wrist.  Soft inside.  I love it.,B0002NYVV4
"Have been looking for jerzee sweat shirts for a while. If I can find the right size, I`ll really be happy.",B0002NYVV4
Nice and would buy again but sizing is off. Large fits like an Extra Large. Check measurements before buying. Otherwise good.,B0002NYVV4
"My husband is the one wearing this shirt. He has commented on how silky the inside feels and how much he likes it. Fit was as it ought to be for this size -- not like sweats have tight tailoring, but one doesn't want a tent or something too snug to work in.",B0002NYVV4
"I have bought several of these sweatshirts and have not been disappointed in the colors, or softness.  I enjoy wearing them and will continue to buy several other colors.  The items came in quickly as well.",B0002NYVV4
I am very pleased with this purchase. I am planning on ordering more ! Fits well and looks really good.,B0002NYVV4
"I purchased Jerzees sweatshirts and pants for my elderly Dad and he loves them.  ""No more belts!"", was his happy comment. Good quality.  Arrived promptly.",B0002NYVV4
"I love it!!!
the size was as expected and the color was more vibrant than expected
and the material is really thick so i know ill stay warm and know it won't brake by just scratching it..with my nail",B0002NYVV4
"This sweater is so cute and I couldn't ask for a better one. It's a little loose on me but that's okay. All and all, it's a really warm sweater.",B0002NYVV4
"The product came on time as always from Amazon. The color is a bright purple, although the picture shows it to be more of a bluish purple. Overall the fit is very good, I am 5' 10"" and 220.",B0002NYVV4
This sweatshirt is well made.  I have washed it many times and it still looks good.  Nice value.  Fits well.,B0002NYVV4
"I love the material used for this crew neck ! Might just buy some more !!! Recommend buying this highly , meet your standards",B0002NYVV4
sent to my husband in afghanistan to wear to showers and back in cold weather and was made good and the fit was perfect,B0002NYVV4
"A great, plain, normal, sweater. It's amazing how hard it is to find something like that. But this is exactly what I was looking for, and it fits just as expected.",B0002NYVV4
sweat shirt was of better quality than I expected ! Was very pleased with it and will go back and order another  soon.,B0002NYVV4
"I give this hideous sweater 3 stars. It served it's purpose well. I appliqued white snowflakes and garland to it for an ugly sweater christmas party. Hopefully, if you are buying this HOT PINK sweater for a man, it is not an item to be seriously worn. It fits as any sweater would and was true to size",B0002NYVV4
My husband loves his sweatshirt.  I bought this as a replacement of his that was fraying apart!  He wears this often and says how nice and warm it keeps him.  Good quality!,B0002NYVV4
Absolutely love this! Bought it for my boyfriend and whenever I get cold he takes it off and makes me wear it. It's really soft instead and brand new. It's great :),B0002NYVV4
"Rate the sweatshirt a four because its light material and not heavy duty for warmth. The feel is soft and warm, but when stepping outside it gives up the warmth factor.",B0002NYVV4
"Bought for my mom who likes sweats to be soft, non-binding and loose. The Jerzees brand don't fade and the color is saturated. Excellent value.",B0002NYVV4
"This sweatshirt is so soft inside, its wonderful.  Since it is a man's sweatshirt, it is wider in the shoulders, but I expected that (a woman reviewing).  Its got a good length, over my hips, and the color is a dark heather gray.",B0002NYVV4
"I bought this at an X-Large and anticipated it would probably shrink a little when washed, as I have always expected with other cheaper brand sweatshirts (it's expected of course). It fit great when I tried it on  before washing but, once it was washed it shrunk alot! I used cold wash, and I'm 5'11 and 180 pounds and Large should basically be fine, but it seems as if this went down to a medium. Therefore, I do recommend basically get two sizes bigger than what you need. I have other X-Large sweatshirts and they fit fine after washing. 3 stars because hey it is cheap but I subtract 2 stars because it shrinks more than other brands that are cheap as well.",B0002NYVV4
"I paid about $8 for one of these.  For that price I can wear them to work and if they are damaged it is no big deal.  They aren't the best quality and will not last as long as more expensive shirts but the price is hard to argue with.

Update

changed my review to 2 stars.  These shirts do not last at all.  They are not even worth $8.",B0002NYVV4
"Actually, too short after washing.  What I am looking for is an extra large that is extra long as well.",B0002NYVV4
After you wash it a couple of times it starts to get cotton ball's all over the sweatshirts please tell me why? Thanks christy,B0002NYVV4
So comfortable and not to heavy and not to light. I am a happy customer and will purchase more very soon!,B0002NYVV4
"I washed it before wearing it and it stayed its true size.  It fits perfect, the cuffs are tight enough so I  don't have to roll them up.  I would definitely recommend this item.",B0002NYVV4
"The sweater gets dirty quickly, also the underarm sleeve is huge ! You get what you pay for so just be aware this is cool for maybe a little art project of craft",B0002NYVV4
"I may have gotten a defective sweatshirt, but I could fit three or four of my arms in each sleeve. Torso fits great, inside is soft, good length, but unwearable because of how bizarrely baggy the sleeves are.",B0002NYVV4
"My son was looking for a black crew neck, order this one hoping he'll approve and he did
He loves it, and it washes great and wears well",B0002NYVV4
The sweatshirt fit as it should with the quality being good for the price.  I would recommended the sweat shirt to anybody looking for an inexpensive but warm sweat shirt.,B0002NYVV4
Soooo soft inside. A few of my girlfriends and I bought these to cut into off the shoulder comfy sweaters for a tacky Christmas party. Worked out beautifully. We ironed on letters and had no problems at all. Love!,B0002NYVV4
"This shirt fits nicely, is very comfortable and looks good.  The shirt is warm and the Amazon price was right.  What more could I ask for?",B0002NYVV4
"I prefer my sweaters to be a little bit bigger than my normal size (that's just my opinion) so i ordered this in large instead of medium. The torso size is alright but the sleeves make me look like a bird! Way too big, would not buy again.",B0002NYVV4
"The small is a BIG small. Watch out. Fits like a medium.

Other than that, it's hard to mess up the classic 50/50 sweatshop sweatshirt. Keeps me warm on an ice cold night run.",B0002NYVV4
I get annoyed at having to give a certain number of words in my comments. It is a gift and that should be sufficent!,B0002NYVV4
Perfect fit and very nice texture for my husband who is sensitive to fabrics.  He liked the color as well.,B0002NYVV4
i choose this color first thing I'm 49ers fiend the color matches  i will recommend 49ers fiend this color buy this color cool sweater,B0002NYVV4
"Fits very well, and heavy enough to be comfortable when working up north in non-heated buildings during construction. Very pleased with over-all performance.",B0002NYVV4
"I ordered this to have it screen printed, and it worked out perfectly. It's a great basic crew neck and it's incredibly soft and comfortable. The picture for the Ash color I ordered, showed a darker grey than expected, but I took a leap of faith ordering it, and when it arrived it was the light grey color I was hoping for.",B0002NYVV4
The medium is just a tad large for my small bone frame. With the cold weather coming on I will just wear a cotton turtleneck under it.,B0002NYVV4
"This sweatshirt is just what I wanted. The size, color and fit are all great. Will order another one when this one wears out (that's if it ever does - I've had Jerzees sweatshirts that last 10 years!",B0002NYVV4
"I have a bunch of these for work, they fit great and last a long time. Would definitely recommend them",B0002NYVV4
The true red color of the sweater did not match the true red color of the pants because they came from too different batchs of the material.,B0002NYVV4
"I have a very hairy chest and certain fabric bothers the body hair. This sweat shirt does not bother the hair under my arms,lower back or my hairy forearms. The fabric is very soft and washes well.",B0002NYVV4
Really a nice sweatshirt. fits well but i havnt washed it yet so i think it might run slightly smaller than other Large size sweatshirts but we shall see. Also got Columbia Blue which is a really nice mellow color. Purchased from 'Under Moments'..Great seller..,B0002NYVV4
"They are made of the very best quality fabric .
It never pills up and holds its color.
I'm 60 years old now and my 1st experience with this was when my kids were in nursery school.
The logo went on these shirts.",B0002NYVV4
I have an old Jersey sweatshirt and needed a new one. This one doesn't quite fit the same but its nice quality especially for the price.,B0002NYVV4
I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and it came within three days after I ordered it. He liked it and it fit him perfect. I got him a size medium and he's like 5'8 and weighs about 150 pounds and it fits great. It was also cheap  for such great quality. Highly recommend it!,B0002NYVV4
"Would be nice if there was another smaller size. This will have to be worn with a shirt underneath, and I had to take some pretty deep tucks in the sleeves for it to be wearable. Very soft, though, and I wouldn't want it too much smaller.",B0002NYVV4
I have about 8 to 10 of these sweatshirts. They are not heavy duty but very comfortable. They wash and fold well too. What else can you say about a sweat shirt. I would recommend this product to a friend.,B0002NYVV4
"I bought this for my friend and it came in really quickly. A medium on my friend usually fits perfectly, this one was kinda baggy. It's super soft on the inside and it's a good quality. My friend loves it!",B0002NYVV4
I love the fabric.  It appears well made.  It just runs very large.  I should have ordered a size smaller.,B0002NYVV4
"I bought this in the color of black and wear it at home cause my house is cold and I only have to wear a shirt and this to keep my warm I use to weat a tank top a shirt long shirt and a jacket

so it really warm but it not really pretty but it not the point",B0002NYVV4
"The width of the sleeves are half the length of the sweater. Keep in mind this is the small size. Unless you can actually fill out the sweater like that, do not buy.",B0002NYVV4
Living in the Pacific Northwest sweatshirts are a Must!! Wear them most of the year so I don't have to wear coats all the time!!!,B0002NYVV4
"It was supposed to be a medium, but fit was more like an extra large. I didn't return it. Just gave to someone else. I've never had this problem before with Jerzees",B0002NYVV4
What a great shirt.  Comfortable and warm.  Goes well with jeans and just relaxing around the house.  Will buy more.,B0002NYVV4
i wish i could return it because the size of this sweatshirt was way too big ! i didn't like it at all!,B0002NYVV4
"Finding a plain white sweatshirt without logo and under $60.00 was a challenge this past Christmas. I finally found the perfect combo in the Jerzees brand. This is all my husband wears with his jeans. I used to be able to find them at various storefront businesses, but not in the past two years. We ordered one for size and fit and will be ordering more.",B0002NYVV4
A very nice sweat shirt at a fair price.  It is well made and the fit is accurate as stated by size.,B0002NYVV4
It was just so hard to find a pink shirt anywhere I'm so glad you had my size in this pink.  Love it,B0002NYVV4
The color is not exactly as pictured and it is a little small but I will enjoy wearing it next Christmas,B0002NYVV4
"Since the shirt is made in China it is best to allow for 1 larger size when buying it, the shirt is not a super thick type yet is good for indoor Winter wear.",B0002NYVV4
"The material is good, the sizing is right, and the tailoring is good.  The color scheme is very good also The  The material is a bit too thin, thus defeating its warming-sweat capability.",B0002NYVV4
"The sweatshirt is everything I expected in the way of appearance, but apparently this style of sweatshirt goes by a different sizing element.  I ordered a Jerzee sweatshirt (a different style) not too long ago in my size, L, but after washing it shrunk.  So, I thought I'd go with the X-large on this one and when it shrunk, it would be perfect.  Well, it did shrink a bit, but not enough, so it's still a little too big. However, I am pleased with the sweatshirt itself, so I will be ordering another one in my normal size.",B0002NYVV4
This is the second time that I had problems with the Jerzees 562 Sweatshirts. The white crew neck completely fell apart during the second wash. The red crew neck shrunk at least two sizes after at least 3 washings on cold water and low heat drying.  Will not buy product again!,B0002NYVV4
"this shirt was a good product,however it was only worn once before the recipient passed away and it was donated to charity.",B0002NYVV4
This fits true to size and does not 'pill' like so many other sweatshirts.  Very soft inside and out with the 50/50.,B0002NYVV4
"I would have ordered bigger, i ordered my size and it still was short around my waist, should have got a bigger size.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice material and color. Washes well BUT,,,,it was soooo big!
Guess it just runs full.  I would not mind ordering another color but will obviously go smaller.",B0002NYVV4
"Fits a little loose, not too much, kind of snug & is the right color to match my USC shoes!!!",B0002NYVV4
"I love the Jerzees 50/50 feel and quality and this particular color is really nice...not quite red, not quite maroon.",B0002NYVV4
"Great sweatshirt to lounge around the house. Not too think where I am hot, but allows me to turn the heat down so I don't have huge gas bills. I bought several more colors of this brand. Very pleased with this product.",B0002NYVV4
"The most comfortable sweatshirts made, especially because they're lightweight. They shrink very little. Here are my seven more required words.",B0002NYVV4
It was received in 3 days! It is a nice warm sweat shirt. I thought I was ordering a women's shirt but from the length of the arm and body believe it a man's. It is a medium. Next time I will order a small. It washed well and stayed in shape. I am 5-3 and small boned so the shirt is a tad too big. Quality of shirt is good.,B0002NYVV4
This sweatshirt is okay. The material is thin for a sweatshirt. Also it has quite a bit of fuzz. Otherwise it fits according to size. I don't know how it will wash up. But it is a good brand so we can hope.,B0002NYVV4
"True to size, Color is great,  Soft and comfortable.
Will get plenty of wear out of it., Perfect for me.",B0002NYVV4
"I Like the sweat shirt  Soft I would Recomend It

It Had a nice price It Arrived arrived on time",B0002NYVV4
This was given to one of our ministers for Christmas. It is necessary that it be as close to ochre color as possible. Color and quality both fit the bill. Happy with this purchase.,B0002NYVV4
"Fit is good, large is large, etc, etc. it's not the heaviest fabric but it says 8 oz and I believe them. The neck looks good and no sag. Not too bad at all.",B0002NYVV4
"I purchased several for my boyfriend.  When new, they are a little big... But after washing, a perfect fit and comfortable.",B0002NYVV4
This sweatshirt was actually nicer than I had expected.  It is warm.  It has held up to washing really well.  I'd buy it again.,B0002NYVV4
Cannot understand the fluctuation on price. It changes from day to day! But the brand is a good one and color washes true.,B0002NYVV4
Great Fitt and all I love it and Plan on buying more maybe It depends on how the weather will be,B0002NYVV4
"I am happy with my sweatshirt.  It is a true black and did not look faded when washed.  I bought this shirt as part of my Halloween costume.  I was a skunk.  The sweatshirt was so comfy and washed nice - so I took my skunk tail and belly fluff off of the shirt and it is now being used for everyday hang-out after-work wear.

I was very surprised, and pleased, with the weight of the fabric.  I will be purchasing other colors.  I suggest this item for the quality and construction.",B0002NYVV4
"Proof that you get what you pay for, these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy. Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans. Ribbing around collar is especially thin. I am still searching for the real thing.",B0002NYVV4
sizing is mens. so look at the sizing chart. good sweatshirt not thick. can be worn on top of other shirts. not bulky either.,B0002NYVV4
It arrived in a timely manner for a Christmas crafting project & was of good quality.  I just wish it was Made in America!,B0002NYVV4
"My daughter needed a plain sweatshirt in either white or black for school so we chose this one when we could not find any sweatshirts in the clothing stores without emblems. It is nice, not too thin, not too thick. Washes well.",B0002NYVV4
"Nice quality sweatshirt. Unfortunately the website shows the color that I bought to more of a lime green. When it arrived it is  more of a glow in the dark green. In face I think it would glow in the dark.

Took longer to get to me then promised.",B0002NYVV4
"I ordered two of these in bright red and blue. I can usually wear most XL sized shirts, and this XL size was perfect for me.  They wash well (so far.) If I wanted another sweatshirt, I would get another of these. They have been really welcome as this has been a cold winter followed by a cold spring.",B0002NYVV4
"Excellent sweatshirts! I have a very old Jerzees and wanted some new ones, so I looked at local stores for Jerzees and was unsuccessful. I found other brands, but I was not pleased with their fit. I was very pleased to find them on the Internet. Also, in addition to the perfect fit, the weight was exactly what I was looking for.",B0002NYVV4
"If you are hanging around the house or working out this is a great item.
No issues with this product. I will be buying again",B0002NYVV4
"I thought this was a woman's sweatshirt - it was black like I wanted, but the sleeves were MUCH too long - I gave it to my boyfriend and it fit him fine.
I'm still looking for a woman's black sweatshirt.  The item did arrive in a timely manner - but it didn't fit me.",B0002NYVV4
"The pink sweatshirt I ordered is great. My only concern is that I ordered a Medium and this is a bit big, however, I am sure it will shrink and be perfect. The color is just what I saw on line and the item came in timely fashion.",B0002NYVV4
"This product is sized just right, washes well, and best of all is not too heavy so it is ideal for layering.  The quality of the product is good.  I loved it so much I ordered several in different colors.  The quality and workmanship was consistent with all items.",B0002NYVV4
With jerzee shirts there is no pilling.  Also it is a perfect weight.  not too heavy.,B0002NYVV4
color not the same as pictured. my orange was a Halloween orange.,B0002NYVV4
"Men small fit me perfect
Im 57 135 lb
So comfy",B0002NYVV4
Received the wrong color on this one. Dislike. Will never wear,B0002NYVV4
"If you want a cheap sweatshirt, go for it. Just don't expect to get more than your money's worth. The fit is atrocious.",B0002NYVV4
Love the fit! Love the material! Looks nice when worn with my outfits.,B0002NYVV4
"The color is awesome  and the fit is fabulous!  Very chic, comfortable  and bold.
-GLJ-CALIFORNIA",B0002NYVV4
Shrank just a tad in the wash but thats okay because it was a little big on me.,B0002NYVV4
"Liked because it's price, but if it little bit thicker it is better",B0002NZ1JU
"I love Port & Company T-Shirts and these are no exception. They fit great and have a nice, solid feel to them. They should last a long time.",B0002NZ28A
"Excellent, well-made, quality shirt. This brand just never lets me down. The color holds up to washings, the shirt doesn't stretch out, but be careful about drying it. I just hang mine up to dry, as the fit is currently perfect and I wouldn't want any shrinkage. Nice length and very comfy.",B0002NZ28A
"This is from my husband's perspective.  He feels the t-shirt is tighter in the shoulders and shorter in the sleeve length.  Will wait to see if the shirt is as durable as past Port and Company t-shirts.  He still likes the brand, and the next purchase of a Port and Company t-shirt will be in the tall sizes.",B0002NZ28A
"The description here is for a 50/50 cotton/poly blend.  But when you add it to your shopping cart, it becomes a 100% cotton shirt -- not what I want.  Already resulted in getting the wrong shirt, so I was going to re-order -- but this time I noticed the problem.  Please correct it, and then you may delete this Review.",B0002NZ28A
Good quality for the price and the fit is pretty good. I bought this for my husband and it is true to size (medium).,B0002NZ28A
This is a very nice black tshirt. I bought it for my husband to wear underneith his uniform. He says it's comfortable and nice thick fabric.,B0002NZ28A
"These are so comfy its sad that they have faded so fast :(
I recommend them if you wash in delicates or don't wear them a lot
They would be perfect if the color stayed BLACK longer",B0002NZ28A
The shirt is true to size.  I had a good experience with this company and would order from them again.,B0002NZ28A
"This shirt is well designed; full cut, and the cotton is nicer and a bit thicker than expected.  The neck feels just right, the length, perfect.  What's not to like?",B0002NZ28A
"Nice, heavy material. Well made and vivid color.",B0002NZ28A
"Nice item, good color, good quality. Don't accept a price over $5.",B0002NZ28A
"Best t-shirt I've ever bought for the money. I'm kind of tall and skinny so most plain t-shirts either are too wide in the belly, too short in the tail, or don't fit in the sleeves. I'm 6'0 160 lbs and I ordered a medium in the black and white and it's a perfect fit. Good material not too heavy and not too thin. Can be used as an under shirt or just a plain t-shirt. I'm ordering more before they discontinue them like everything else I like",B0002NZ28A
I have other Port& Company tshirts that are fantastic. This shirt came with sewed in label vs the others I already have that have print labels. This tshirt bottom rolls up after washing.,B0002NZ28A
Material and color nice.  Fits great.,B0002NZ28A
"6X and still tight.  I have several shirts in this size and 1 is loose, and 1 is tight.  Both are T-shirts and 100% cotton.  This one shrinks and the other doesn't.",B0002NZ28A
"6X and still tight.  I have several shirts in this size and 1 is loose, and 1 is tight.  Both are T-shirts and 100% cotton.  This one shrinks and the other doesn't.",B0002NZ28A
"Perfect color. No give to the fabric though, so it's sturdy but not very comfortable.",B0002NZ28A
"Nice shirts, didn't shrink too much in the dryer, collar stays tight around neck, perfect undershirt even though they are a little thick. I would recommend these.",B0002NZ28A
Love these Ts. Not just wider but longer as well. Did not shrink in the wash.,B0002NZ28A
"Fight was as expected. Loose but not baggy, enough room in the stomach and not tight in the neck or sleeves.",B0002NZ28A
Port and Company 5.4 or 6.1 oz. > all,B0002NZ28A
True to size and very soft and comfy. Highly recommended.,B0002NZ28A
"Port and Company shirts fit a little bit tighter in the tummy than Gildan shirts.  Other than that, they are the same nice heavy material  and well-made.",B0002NZ28A
i cant tear the tags off without putting holes in the shirts,B0002NZ28A
Great t-shirts especially for the price.  Not thin and wimpy.  launder well and stay shaped.  I'm ordering more for Christmas,B0002NZ28A
Great price on the quality t-shirts...,B0002NZ28A
"Correct size (XL), but not very comfortable. Feels like it's starched with an entire can of spray starch",B0002NZ28A
"Great color, just not the same fit as other large t-shirts.",B0002NZ28A
"The shirt is a polyester/cotton blend, and is cut longer than regular cotton shirts.",B0002NZ28A
"The T-shirt I received is 50% cotton and 50% polyester instead of 100% cotton. Either the description is fraud or the seller puts fraud item. If I knew it was not 100% cotton, I wouldnt have bought it.",B0002NZ28A
"I love this shirt, it fit me perfectly.  It feels good and it's comfortable.  I love the material, don't get the one that is part cotton and part polyester cause then it feels too thin and doesn't feel right.",B0002NZ28A
loved it and recieved in a timely fashon,B0002NZ28A
"Just a little too tight in the arm pits.  I should have got a large instead of a medium.  But sometimes the large length in the Port & Company is way too long by 3"".

It also is too snug around my Adam's apple.
Otherwise I like the shirt",B0002NZ28A
"I love the color of this shirt,It fits nicely and looks good on me.",B0002NZ28A
Too tight around hips. Course I'm female so that's probably not a real problem.,B0002NZ28A
great quality t-shirt! did not shrink! hard to find longer t-shirts,B0002NZ28A
Colors are nice and the quality is good.,B0002NZ28A
"Well made shirt, and though I had selected the wrong color for my purpose I still kept this one around and I regularly wear it just because it looks good and manages to keep on par with the rest of my wardrobe. Good stuff from a basic t-shirt, well done.",B0002NZ28A
"Great tee, no tag and just perfect as usual.",B0002NZ28A
"Seemingly smaller than normal neck hole. The tear off tag completely disappears when you tear it off and it makes it hard to find out which way to put the shirt on.

I'm 6 feet 2 inches and 175 lbs and the large fits well.",B0002NZ28A
"[MEDIUM]

I def like this tee. The material is thick and not the soft type, it a little on the stiff side (I like it) the neck is small and not oversized, so if you have a skinny neck it looks great to me as it fits snugly around your neck. After a wash, it shrinks a little about 2% but fits great in my case.

I absolutely hate long tees that cover your entire butt where you do not even need pants on as everything is covered. This is as long as in in the pic so pretty close to reality. I'm 170 Lbs and about 5.8"" so I def give these a thumbs up.

My kind of tees are:
Thick and heavy, not soft.
Short about 2 in below you pants main button.
Med tight around the sleeves.

This fit the bill!",B0002NZ28A
Im a basic guy. I always liked my shirts to be basic with no graphics on them. I bought a T-shirt here once and I never went back to fruit of the loom T-shirts! The quality of the shirts are amazing! Ive been buying my T-shirts here for over a year now and I absolutely love it.,B0002NZ28A
"For some reason, I thought this tee was made in America... but no, when I got it, I could see on the label, it was from China like almost everything else.",B0002NZ28A
"6X and still tight.  I have several shirts in this size and 1 is loose, and 1 is tight.  Both are T-shirts and 100% cotton.  This one shrinks and the other doesn't.",B0002NZ316
"Love it, and the price is great",B0002NZ316
Just what I expected - great weekend shirt.,B0002NZ1UO
I wear these shirts everyday and the hold up very well and the cost is reasonable.,B0002NZ1YK
I was doubtful because there wasn't any reviews and the picture looked fake but I purchased it anyway and hoped for the best. I ordered a size 3T in red for my 3 year old daughter. It was thick and super soft inside. Color and style was just like picture. It hasn't faded yet nor has the material deteriorated just yet. It was for a disneyland trip but she has worn it many times after because its so cute and cozy for this cold weather. We like it! Thanks! Appreciate the reliability! Good pricing as well.,B0002NZGYA
"These shirts are nice quality and a great price but they are HUGE . I am 5'10"" and a perfect ladies size 10 and they were still enormous . I had to return them all .",B0002NZC76
"Love these shirts sizing is true, they feel good on and they wash beautifully. What more could you ask for. My goal is to have one of each color.",B0002NZ87U
"The shirt arrived looking just like the picture, but it was a bit bigger than I had anticipated. I probably should have ordered a medium instead of a large.",B0002NZ87U
Polo fits great and washes up nicely.  No wrinkles on the Port Authority polos.  I have three different colors now.,B0002NZ87U
"I wanted this shirt because of the color, Shirt fit well and it goes great with lot of color/things. Great looking shirt!.",B0002NZ87U
I loved my PORT AUTHORITY polo the sizing was great.  I had ordered another polo a differed brand at the same time (Port Authoritu ded noy offer my color) and the sizing was off).  I am expectin a refund for that one and will reorder another PORT AUTHORITY Polo.  Great fit and the fabric and color are also first quality.,B0002NZ87U
I bought my size but it was to big.  Same size as every other shirt in my closet.  I was disappointed.  did not want to hassle to sent it back.,B0002NZ87U
"Nice Fit Comfortable. Good for work and home. Enjoy the material, Good for the price. Dont wash in washer it does shrink",B0002NZ87U
"I hate wearing polo shirts that look like I'm just wearing a smaller size of a man's polo shirt.  Unfortunately, a fitted polo doesn't exist unless you also want it to be skin-tight or really short (some even shrink significantly after a wash/dry).  I need to look professional for work...and like a woman.",B0002NZ87U
very nice shirt would rate it with shirts costing twice as much. would highly recamend them. theses shirt come in many colors,B0002NZ87U
"The shirt is a good fit and comfortable to move around in.  Not the best at staying tucked in due to length, but doesn't look terrible if it does.",B0002NZ87U
"It worked great, but it does shrink a little so maybe get a size up than you usually would",B0002NZ87U
Ok. Didnt keep its shape after first wash. Still a good shirt for the weekend/errands but I won't wear it back to work.,B0002NZ87U
Definitely not soft... and was a bit small.,B0002NZ87U
The port authority silk touch came as expected and  pretty much fit as expected. It is NOT however a silk touch shirt as I expected it to be.  I ordered this one for my wife. I have ordered several directly from the company and not had an issue so Im not sure what happened here. But there sure is regular cotton shirt. Which is what I did not want because I did not want a shirt but is going to fade and shrink up short and wide. I was expecting the silk like golf shirt material.,B0002NZ87U
"Shirt not silk touch, rather a cheap cotton blend that is rough to the touch.",B0002NZ87U
"Great polo shirts! I had read reviews and some were stating that they were ""boxy"", I must be ""boxy"" lol!! Fit as expected",B0002NZ87U
Its supposed to be the silk touch shirt but it is not its more of a cotton shirt.,B0002NZ87U
Like this work shirt very comfortable,B0002NZ87U
The color is exactly the color I expected terd. The texture of the material is not.,B0002NZ87U
"Beautiful top, perfect fit, nice drape!",B0002NZ87U
Nice material; not impressed with the color.  Slightly smaller than I expected.,B0002NZ87U
Too small. Color is pretty. The large fits like a medium would. Not like the size chart recommended,B0002NZ87U
I LOVE the color..... lightweight shirt. washes well.,B0002NZ87U
Not totally flattering but serviceable.,B0002NZ87U
Fit just as expected and is nice quality.,B0002NZ87U
Size was smaller than expected.  Lightweight which is what I wanted them for.  Material is a bit rough.,B0002NZ87U
"I love these shirts, I buy them and then have them monogrammed with my work logo. The size runs a little big, a small fits more like a medium, I typically wear a medium but I had to purchase small in these shirts so def size down, at least thats how it happened for me. Im 51 and 140lbs, small fits great, still fits a little loose so if you are looking for a fitted shirt then you would prob have to go down two sizes.",B0002NZ87U
Like colored buttons and the fit.,B0002NZ87U
"I like the green color, that it's longer, and not fitted in the hips to make them look like saddlebags. Light-weight enough for 100 days. I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs and ordered a XS. Seems to have shrunk a little after 5+ washes so that it's a bit snug in the shoulders. Maybe a small would have been better, but I wouldn't have wanted it any longer than it is.",B0002NZ87U
"It is a bit large, but I still like it.  Tuck it in, and it looks good.",B0002NZ87U
The most comfortable polo shirts I've found yet!,B0002NZ87U
So happy to finally find a golf shirt that fits well and isn't hot!,B0002NZ87U
I wanted XXL. Accidently put in XL.,B0002NZ87U
"Color matched the picture and made in quality fabric, ran a little big though.",B0002NZ87U
Very pleased with this purchase.,B0002NZ87U
"Love the color, and fits nicely, but the definition 'Silk Touch' is really not accurate.  Knit is larger than I had expected.",B0002NZ87U
Love the shirt abd the quality of the material. Very little shrinkage if any,B0002NZ87U
Really soft and good color choices.  Runs a little wide,B0002NZ87U
"Bought based on the size charts. I would say the cut is more 'roomy' than a standard ladies polo. Also compared to other Polo's I own, I would not call this a 'Silk Touch'; It is definitely lighter than a standard polo but is still a standard cotton style material.",B0002NZ87U
"color matches what I expected, not crazy soft but feels like some of my other polos so no complaints on that. Pro: spilled some coffee on it within 15 minutes of wearing but was able to brush it off and it didn't leave a mark at all. Con: the tag is itchy and that isn't normally an issue for me. I'll be removing the tag when I get home. I washed it before I wore it too.",B0002NZ87U
I am normally a L in women clothing. I read the reviews about the fit so I ordered a M. I should have ordered a S. The sizing of these shirts are so far off than normal clothing. The fit is very square and looks horrible tucked in due to the amount of extra fabric. Will never order again,B0002NZ87U
"Very comfortable, the length is just right, good quality. I kept ordering different  brands and wasn't  satisfied with any of them until I found this one.",B0002NZ87U
The fabric is pretty thin.... won't be ordering any more.,B0002NZ87U
Love the color. The shirt is well made with nice button detail,B0002NZ87U
"I love the fit and color of this polo. I purchased the eggplant (dark purple) in an XL and it fit me just as it should. I like the polo so much, I bought two more in tropical pink and light pink. The fabric is light and airy (perfect for hot days at the office). I was wondering whether I'd like the polyester/cotton blend but I like it just fine. It is soft and there's a slight mesh knit to the shirt. If you hold it up to the light you can almost see through it, but when I am wearing it with an appropriate bra, you can't see anything untoward. Great shirt in a fabulous range of colors for the price.",B0002NZ87U
Great for the high school uniform.,B0002NZ87U
nice material..fit true to size,B0002NZ87U
Ordered a L received a M - disappointing.,B0002NZ87U
"It Fit as expected - but only because I ordered up a size and glad I did.  The XXL fit like 1X usually fits.  Overall a pretty nice shirt. It washes well, didn't shrink - but I line dry, so not sure if it would have shrunk in the dryer.  Wish these companies would get a uniform sizing figured out.",B0002NZ87U
"The fit is very boxy. I bought 4 colours in size small. All fit the same, loose under the arms(bust 34C). I am pear shaped so the shirt sits comfortably on my 42inch hip. I am contemplating trying to put bust darts in to improve the fit. The arms are loose too, but I have thin arms. If you like a closer fit you might want to go down a size.
 The colours are vibrant. The hibiscus looks more like a neon orange, I really do not like it, looks nothing like the pinkish colour advertised. I am probably going to give this one away and order another colour. The other colours, cool grey, teal green, and the deep berry seem like the colours on the screen. The cool grey and the hibiscus did not run when I rinsed them, but the teal and berry colour did.
 The material is not heavy, and since I will be working in hot conditions this is ideal. The shirts are not see through. Fabric feels smooth to the touch, soft, not coarse at all.",B0002NZ87U
Love the soft feel of the cotton.  It didn't shrink in the wash either.  I will definitely buy more.,B0002NZ87U
It fit fine for my 11 year old daughter aside from the fact that it took almost two weeks to arrive.,B0002NZ87U
I love the Polo shirts from this company. I buy them for my daughter who has to wear them for school and she's a bit overweight and they fit her perfectly.,B0002NZ87U
"Looks ok and does the job. However, they don't wash well and the collar constantly rolls.",B0002NZ87U
Great product. Fit as expected. I wish it was a little more form fitting.,B0002NZ87U
I love the feel of the material. I wash excessively and they have maintained their color well.,B0002NZ87U
Very comfortable & material is nicer than expected. Collar is not too stiff & material washes perfectly - no wrinkles even after leaving in dryer.,B0002NZ87U
Perhaps should have ordered one size down. Prefer a bit large to a bit small. Will know better next time.,B0002NZ87U
What I ordered ran big in this color. I ordered Royal blue and it was true to size.,B0002NZ87U
Had a promo shirt from work and love it so much.  Retired now and so glad I found these.  Wear like iron.,B0002NZ87U
Very comfy. Will order more in different colors,B0002NZ87U
Fabric was VERY thin.  You can see light through two layers of shirt if you hold it up. Worked okay though because it is a dark color.,B0002NZ87U
"Good quality, but runs a little large, but very comfortable. I would buy it again!",B0002NZ87U
Love the light weight fabric.  Great fit and wrinkle guard.,B0002NZ87U
Had used this company for many years and the product is excellent. Wash and wear and seems never to wear out.,B0002NZ87U
Fabric is good. Runs a little large. Will buy a size down next time.,B0002NZ87U
Great fit and fun color.  I'll definitely be buying again.,B0002NZ87U
Fits as expected.  Great for work. Ready to order more.,B0002NZ87U
Relaxed fit very comfortable.  Great Work shirt!,B0002NZ87U
Can't possibly be sized correctly,B0002NZ87U
"Very nice shirt, soft and fits as expected.  After washing it retained its shape. Would recommend.",B0002NZ87U
"It is a nice shirt, the fit is just fine. Happy to find an olive color polo shirt!",B0002NZ87U
Very comfortable and wash great.,B0002NZ87U
not that well constructed has already snagged.,B0002NZ87U
Excellent quality for the price,B0002NZ87U
I purchased 4 for work and I would highly recommend. Great fit and great quality.,B0002NZ87U
"Fits well. Took forever to get here. About two weeks. However, I should have read the makeup of the material. This is 65% Polyester and 35% cotton and it is miserably hot. I bought for field days for work and I can't wear it. The pit stains are horrible.",B0002NZ87U
I ordered the Banana yellow and the Ultramarine blue both in small. The blue fits great and fit even better after a wash. It's a comfortable relax fit polo but still looks professional and polished. The yellow however did not do well after a wash. The fabric looks and feels a bit different from the blue and it's much wider.,B0002NZ87U
"Fits just the way I wanted it to and arrived 2 days early. Fabric is softer than I expected, too.",B0002NZ87U
"Doesn't wrinkle, really nice color.  A bit on the snug side and warm.  I won't wear it to work due to it not being cooler.",B0002NZ87U
"Love the fit because it's not ""fitted"" and more relaxed for a polo shirt which is hard to find. Definitely long enough to tuck in and fold out over pants for professional wear.",B0002NZ87U
"First off, I HATE polo shirts. The material is usually too hot, the necks are usually too scratchy and tight, and they just look dorky. However, my job requires a blue polo and I didn't want to buy extra shirts through the company because I didn't want to spend a lot on something I'm just going to wear to work. These shirts exceeded my expectations. The fabric is lightweight, the collar doesn't feel like a noose, and they actually look nice. I get hot easily on my job, so comfort is a must. If you have a job that just requires a solid colored polo, get one of these. You won't regret it.",B0002NZ87U
"Love the material,love the color; however it is larger than I expected.  All the polo shirts I own are large and fit better than this one.  I am 5'4"" and weigh 145#.  I should have ordered medium.",B0002NZ87U
Great fit.  Keeps size and shape after wasing/drying.,B0002NZ87U
"A little large in size,  otherwise great",B0002NZ87U
"Thin, see through material. The point was to have a light weight shirt for the summer. If I have to wear another shirt underneath, it defeats the purpose.",B0002NZ87U
The neck label was scratchy but otherwise I love this shirt!,B0002NZ87U
"This says silk touch, but it's more like a knit. Comfortable, but not a dri fit. Nice shirt for the money.",B0002NZ87U
Ordered a Medium and it's Waay too big.  The description says silky - but the material is more textured and bumpy.  Still a nice shirt and I will wear it to work with a lite jacket.,B0002NZ87U
Bought them for the girls in the restaurant..They all fit great and the girls love them. I also have some and I love mine..they are soft and fit great and they wasshed great with no shrinking...,B0002NZ87U
"Good quality and fit as expected.  However, I would like it better if the material was a little thicker.",B0002NZ87U
"Nice quality, great fit, and kept shape with very little shrinkage. I will continue to buy this product.",B0002NZ87U
"Good quality material. Thick cotton Polo with more of a men's fit. The eggplant is a deep purple. I'm 5'7"" and 145 lbs with a pear shape, fits well. Pleased for a work shirt.",B0002NZ87U
Have purchased Port Authority many times..an excellent wearing shirt,B0002NZ87U
It's a tad smaller but still fits I like it .,B0002NZ87U
Perfect for my serving job. Nice and cool. Dries quick as well. Color true to pic. Great price.,B0002NZ87U
Loved it!!! I think I should have gotten a size smaller. I got a Medium. I'm very petite and I like clothes to fit tightly around my body. But you it's just a uniform work shirt so it'll do.,B0002NZ87U
Great quality and a great price!,B0002NZ87U
"Once I got over the XXL, thanks to the many reviewers who said these run small. I do love wearing them. Had them embroidered with my business logo. Beautiful!!",B0002NZ87U
"I ordered the Kelly green & Steel polo shirts both shirts arrived in good condition.  Fabric was thinner than I thought it would be, it's not see through but if I held the shirt up toward a lamp/light (about 10' away) I could see lamp light through the fabric.  FWIW, I don't typically do this with my other shirts/blouses; whatever I did was a fluke, but thought it worth mentioning.  Lastly, I didn't think the shirts were as soft as the description implies, once washed & dried w/ dryer sheet, then yes, nice & soft.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the tops; so much so, I ordered the sunflower yellow (received today), purple, & strong blue.",B0002NZ87U
"I bought this shirt for work. I normally wear a medium but after reading the reviews, decided to order a small. The shirt is still way too large and very shapeless. It fits more like a man's shirt than a ladies'. There is also a small brown stain on the left shoulder. Very disappointed. Requested a refund. We will see how long it takes to go through.",B0002NZ87U
"I love the shirt and would be glad to order more in the future but, the seam came loose on one of the sleeves already. that's a bit too  fast I would think.",B0002NZ87U
It's okay however I will not be buying another one. The quality of the shirt isn't what i expected and don't really know how well it will hold up after a few washes.,B0002NZ87U
"Holds up well through numerous laundry procedures, very silky feel.  Ships FAST!",B0002NZ87U
"I read reviews on this item and did not see one for the X-Large sizes, so I followed the reviews and ordered a size smaller, not wanting to be swimming in an oversize shirt at work.  But I found that in this size, it is probably better to go up a size instead of down one.  It is also very short.  That could be attributed to the tight fit. But the measurement from the neckline is 28.5 inches.  Other than that the shirt appears to be of good quality.",B0002NZ87U
The size said can all but I got a size large or bigger.,B0002NZ87U
Beautiful color.....tempted to buy another one!,B0002NZ87U
"I have always liked Port Authority polo shirts, but for some reason these faded quickly.",B0002NZ87U
"Too boxy, thought it would be more fitted like on the model.",B0002NZ87U
"I have had the same 3 shirts for 3 years now. I got them for work and they have done very well. The only thing I have had to do in those 3 years is sew on a button that fell off. If you work at a company that requires you to use polo shirts, get this!!",B0002NZ87U
Perfect Fit.  It washes & wears well!,B0002NZ87U
Nice color as expected and fits well with the bottom I had in mind!,B0002NZ87U
"Great polo for the money.  Runs a bit large, I feel.  Fabric feels nice and doesn't wrinkle. Definately will use as a work shirt.  But Port Authority, for crying out loud, invest in the taggless technology.  Itchy tags are so yesterday.",B0002NZ87U
ORDER A SIZE LESS. THE COLORS ARE VERY PRETTY,B0002NZ87U
They do not hold up to wear. And the color fades fast.,B0002NZ87U
"itis a nice shirt, just didn't fit asI expected",B0002NZ87U
"Way too big and long....
Purchased the Medium size I normally wear, but it seems a size bigger.
Very upset about it.",B0002NZ87U
"I was conflicted with the sizing reviews so I felt it necessary to submit my input.  I am typically a size small.  I wear a size 4 usually and am a 34B chest.  I bought both the XS and the Small in three different colors and the XS fit perfectly with room to spare.  The shoulders fit well and the length did too (I'm 5'8"" with a long torso).  It wasn't too tight across the chest and it wasn't exactly fitted down the sizes but because it hit at a reasonably length and had the side tails, I will wear this tucked out and still look professional.  It's a bit on the thinner side for a polo but it's not see through.  Decently made.",B0002NZ87U
Washes and wears well. Durable material.,B0002NZ87U
"Can't beat the quality for the price. Isn't terribly form fitting, but not awkwardly baggy.",B0002NZ87U
"Washes well, fabric quality is very good.",B0002NZ87U
The material feels wonderful and the shirt fits well.,B0002NZ87U
"nice polo, but a little smaller than I anticipated. tight cut in armpits.",B0002NZ87U
"I ordered a Small based off the size chart and it's huge. The size chart says the bust measurement for a small is something like 34-36in. I measured the actual shirt and it's 19.5in across the chest so it has a bust measurement of 40in total. It's very baggy. The sleeves are really long for short sleeves? They fall like 3/4 of the way to my elbow. I'm not sure why it's called a ""ladies"" polo because it's cut to be straight i.e. it doesn't taper in towards the waist at all. The only acceptable way for me to wear it and look ""put together"" would be to tuck it in, but then you can still tell it's really big because of how long the sleeves are.",B0002NZ87U
"This is a very nice top, especially given the reasonable price. I've already bought one and am planning on buying a few more. The one I bought seemed to run a little small, though, so I'm going to order up a size next time.",B0002NZ87U
The banana yellow color was exactly what they showed in the picture. Like a pale baby yellow. Very comfortable material.,B0002NZ87U
Fits perfect and is super soft. Might have to order another one!!,B0002NZ87U
I like this shirt it is very comfortable. It fits very well.,B0002NZ87U
Great color:  it's not easy to find teal.,B0002NZ87U
Color is a lot lighter than pictured.,B0002NZ87U
"These port authority shirts are the best! They're great quality, wear well, come out of the dryer with no wrinkles and are very affordable! I love them for work! I have lots of colors!",B0002NZ87U
"I am usually a women's large but these run a little big so I bought a medium, which fits well. I gave 4 stars because they do shrink up in length in washing. I ordered the Maui Blue which does not match the photo very well, it's more of a bright blue turquoise but I guess I can live with it. I also ordered dark gray, which matches the description. These are great for work so I am happy with them and the price is right. I used to buy old navy polos but those have way too much stretch to them, which these do not. Recommend to buy a size down and expect them to shrink a bit in length, otherwise, perfect!",B0002NZ87U
"Wonderful polo, fits well, material better than expected",B0002NZ87U
"Great Color! Feels wonderful, fits great! I bought 8 of them!",B0002NZ87U
XS is perfect for me. I am a small person and women's 0-2 are often to big. I don't like to go to the JR section to buy clothes because they are too clingy. I will end up buying more colors so I can where them to work.,B0002NZ87U
Nice material...but runs large.,B0002NZ87U
Perfect fit perfect shade of red.,B0002NZ87U
Cut of the shirt feels masculine.,B0002NZ87U
Product is not the smoothest or silkiest polo that I have had. Because of the name I expected smoother fabric. Other than that I like it very much..,B0002NZ87U
I was just disappointed that the pink one didn't come in.  I am working in Afghanistan so white/beige will become dirty very quickly.,B0002NZ87U
The polo arrived just as expected. The item is as described and a great value.,B0002NZ87U
"The quality of the shirt was great, the size looked more like a large than a small. Because of the quality and the price, I decided to give it another try, and ordered an 'extra small'.  It hasn't come yet, but will let you know how that works.",B0002NZ87U
"I was excited to see polos for women in plus sizes!  Love the variety of colors.  Upon arrival I noticed that these were way too short.  Unless you want your muffin top to show, don't waste your money on these.",B0002NZ87U
The shirts are perfect for work.,B0002NZ87U
A little small but the colors are perfect for my work,B0002NZ87U
"I was expecting a bit heavier material, but overall this is a very nice casual shirt.",B0002NZ87U
"I love the way they fit, just a tiny bit small.",B0002NZ87U
Great shirt. The purple is true to color on website. I ordered one size up (XXL) in order to have extra room in the sleeves. The regular XL fits fine but the sleeves give no extra room to wear a long sleeve shirt underneath.,B0002NZ87U
Not silk feel. I would return but not worth it.,B0002NZ87U
"Excellent shirt. Looks professional, fits great and wonderfully priced! Bought three!",B0002NZ87U
I love it fits great & like the fabric nice & comfy,B0002NZ87U
Very soft with a nice fit.  Especially like the buttons.,B0002NZ87U
Needed for work....Fit as expected..same color as 1 free shirt given for dress code....can wear a t shirt under it!.....Will order again,B0002NZ87U
Good and comfortable.  Washes very well,B0002NZ87U
Super short.. Above the belt..granted we ordered xxl sizing should be a bit more proportionate,B0002NZ87U
"Does NOT have a silk touch, either.  The only thing I like is the color.",B0002NZ87U
I ordered these same shirts a while back and they were so much nicer.  These have a real small sleeve-fits tightly.  They just aren't the quality I expected.,B0002NZ87U
Comfortable. Fits right. Bought it for my school uniform & color matched. Happy with purchase.,B0002NZ87U
"It was a gift for my sister. I have gotten her the white ones for work and since they fit so well, I bought some in different colors for casual wear",B0002NZ87U
"I love these shirts for work.  I now have 7 different  colors.  They fit as they should.  They are well made and have held up to weekly washings since September 1st.  Colors are still pure.  They come out of the dryer wrinkle free.  I will say that they come with a stitched in tag in the neck that I cut out because I cannot stand the feel.  Once the tag is gone, I'm good to go.  They are soft and comfortable.  I'm planning on adding more colors soon.",B0002NZ87U
I love the Port Authority Silk Touch Polo shirts!  They fit nice and wash up great!  I've had some for 6-7 years...and they still look great!,B0002NZ87U
This is a work uniform. I can't bring myself to give it five stars because I have to wear it. Mandatory uniforms are the worst!,B0002NZ87U
This shirt is big in the shoulders.  The color is perfect.,B0002NZ87U
"Just received this shirt yesterday. I own ALOT of polo shirts to wear for work. I am an Athletic Trainer and travel with a college sports team. It's important to me to get a shirt that fits well, doesn't fade, shrink, or snag. I am usually a size L or XL in unisex size t-shirts or ladies size 14/16. Upon measuring myself and looking at the size chart I decided to order an XXL. It fits as well as it could. If your a small petite woman keep in mind this shirt isn't overly fitted. I'm larger though and my only wish is that it would be slightly longer so I could tuck it in. However, it is long enough for me to raise my hands over my head and not have my stomach show.  The texture of the shirt is only slightly more sheer than a 100% cotton polo. I would NOT consider it a silk texture like in the title. However, It does show bra lines. I don't think this will snag too easily unlike some 100% polyester shirts (this shirt is 65% polyester 35% cotton). I do wish the styling was more feminine. The front where it buttons down is large like a mans and only has three buttons. Care instructions say to wash in cold water and dry on low so I am fearful I will shrink it by accidently putting it through the dryer on medium or high heat.  Only time will tell if this shrinks, snags, or fades. I'll update my review if the shirt doesn't hold up adequately. Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this shirt, however, it isn't my favorite polo!",B0002NZ87U
Very comfortable and fit to size,B0002NZ87U
"This is the shirt that is part of our dress requirement for work.  I love the way it fits and the way it launders.  I work in a nursing home where the thermostat is always higher than comfort for me.  These shirts help me stay cool, and they are light.  The term silk is sort of misleading.  I wasn't sure about ""silk"", but found it is only a feel-like silk.",B0002NZ87U
"The material is on the thin side.  It's fine for the summer.  Also, it is too boxy for my taste.  I bought it because the price is right and I have to wear collard shirts at my job.",B0002NZ87U
fits very well ... soft material ... very comfortable,B0002NZ87U
"Shorter length, needed to be a little longer.",B0002NZ87U
I really liked the quality of the shirt and have ordered in several other colors.,B0002NZ87U
"I thought the fabric would be silky, but it's not. It's just fabric nothing special but isn't scratchy. It's okay for a work shirt.",B0002NZ87U
Arrived on time and very pleased on the fit too.,B0002NZ87U
"I love these shirts. They look nice, wash well and keep looking good. They are very comfortable.",B0002NZ87U
"When its called Silk Touch, I assumed dri-fit material but its cotton.  I guess that's what I get for assuming!  Overall, it fits as expected and is a nice shirt, just not what I was expecting.",B0002NZ87U
"Wished they could be longer, nice shirt",B0002NZ87U
Light color... not soft clothing. It states silk touch; not sure what they were talking about.,B0002NZ87U
The material is soft and it washes nicely.,B0002NZ87U
"Purchased this in size Womens Large. Received a Mens size Large, which is a totally different cut and style than a Womens shirt.
Also, this shirt is soft, but REALLY thin and totally see through. Plan to wear a shirt or tank top under it or you will be showing off everything!
I am not happy at all!!!",B0002NZ87U
"A bit small, didn't know how to return them, I gave them both away???",B0002NZ87U
I ordered this shirt in court green. The color is very vibrant and beautiful. I love the feel and quality of the shirt as well. Would defiantly order again in the future.,B0002NZ87U
"I would not recommend purchasing this shirt.  It is not silk touch.  The fabric is rough and it's so thin, it's almost see-thru.  I ordered the medium, but probably should have gotten a large.  It runs small through the shoulders.  This is a very poor quality item.  I got it on sale for $8.99 and it's not even worth that much.",B0002NZ87U
"Decent quality, neutral color.  I will probably buy it again.",B0002NZ87U
Great feel to the material. Loved the colors,B0002NZ87U
I love this Polo shirt. It is so soft and it fits perfectly.,B0002NZ87U
"I typically wear either a L or XL in polos.  I thought I'd try the XL in this brand.  Nope, should have gone XXL.",B0002NZ87U
I had to do some alterations as the medium size shirt was larger than I expected.  Otherwise I like the style and colors.,B0002NZ87U
Way too baggy. Looks pretty much like your wearing a sack,B0002NZ87U
"Not too crazy about the material, doesn't hold neat shape.",B0002NZ87U
I wear them everyday! Love them. Very comfortable.,B0002NZ87U
I always wait until I wash the item before I make any comments. The shirt fit perfect and after one washing and drying still fit perfect. I am very happy with my purchase.,B0002NZ87U
Great product and so inexpensive,B0002NZ87U
I work in the hospitality business and and i love these shirts! They get washed often and hold up really well. Great price too!,B0002NZ87U
"I expected it to shrink and it didn't. I should have bought a small and not a medium. Good quality, soft cotton. Holding up well.",B0002NZ87U
Nice shirt. Great for the value.,B0002NZ87U
The shirt is as expected.  I need orange polo shirts for work because orange is part of our school colors. It seems well made and not cheap.  It fits well.  Satisfied so far.,B0002NZ87U
Other than size it's a great buy.,B0002NZ87U
could have used a little more room thru the middle,B0002NZ87U
"very nice quality, color and size very accurate",B0002NZ87U
Good buy. Nice quality for the price.,B0002NZ87U
"Nice color, ordered xxl was given xl. Not happy!",B0002NZ87U
Got this for work; comfortable and fits well though I noticed some slight fabric changes with only 2 washes where the material rubs against my bra,B0002NZ87U
"The fit is a tiny bit snug, but good construction. I was disappointed in the color. The tropical pink is a little muddy and a few shades off Pepto Bismol pink",B0002NZ87U
"It looks nice.
Washes and hangs dry without ironing.
Perfect for work",B0002NZ87U
Great value. It's hard to find a well made polo for an affordable price. The color selections are awesome.,B0002NZ87U
Found that going up one size made this polo a perfect fit!,B0002NZ87U
"loved this shirt! ok so it doesn't feel like silk but it isn't as rough as other polo shirts, ordering more!",B0002NZ87U
Based on some other's comments I ordered a size larger.  It was closer to being 2 sizes too big.  Because I have large hips I normally wear a 1X but ordered a 2X.  I should have ordered an XL.  The quality is great - I washed it in hopes of shrinking but it didn't shrink.  It is a very nice shirt I just wish I'd ordered a smaller size.  Since I washed it I can't return it so now I've got to find someone who can wear it.,B0002NZ87U
A little lighter weight fabric than what I expected.,B0002NZ87U
"I ordered several (14) of these shirts in different colors.  The ones made in China are the correct size, Women's 2XL the ones made in Vietnam are too small (Ladies XL).",B0002NZ87U
"Nice shirt, it does not shrink and is long.",B0002NZ87U
Fits as expected. Looks more expensive than it is.  Good bargain,B0002NZ87U
This shirt is made of good quality material that washes well.  It is long enough so that everything stays covered.  One downsize is that the tag is quite itchy even after removing it.  I prefer the stamped on type of tag.,B0002NZ87U
Perfectly fit as expected...material is ok..!!!,B0002NZ87U
Color different than I expected.,B0002NZ87U
Great product. Just what we wanted,B0002NZ87U
"I wear it to work for casual days. The material is thin, but that adds to the attractiveness for me.",B0002NZ87U
Very quick and satisfactory resolution when contacted about the item being to big.,B0002NZ87U
"Good quality but the fit is a little small, the large fit more like a medium.",B0002NZ87U
I really like polo shirts and wasn't disappointed with this one.  I am using the green and blue for a prayer group.  Had the name printed and I'm happy.,B0002NZ87U
"It arrived just as advertised. I find the Port Authority tops are a true fit, comfortable, and wears well.",B0002NZ87U
"as is indicated as the time of arrival was the product has reached me, excellent",B0002NZ87U
Comfortable and durable.  Can't beat the price.,B0002NZ87U
"Very happy with fabric, size, color",B0002NZ87U
"I ordered a small and got more like a XL. Wasn't true to the color in the picture, it was more dull.",B0002NZ87U
I really liked them will order again,B0002NZ87U
I've ordered a large dark green women's shirt and I've received a large light green men's shirt. It is not even close to what I've ordered. Very upset because I needed it for work.,B0002NZ87U
"What else can I say, I love it.",B0002NZ87U
I wear a x-l but it was a little tight.,B0002NZ87U
"I love the color and even though it is too big, it is very comfortable and looks nice.",B0002NZ87U
"I was disappointed with color. Understanding irbid impossible to truly depict color given differences in viewing devices, I expected a deeper color. It was paler than I expected. A little faded looming.",B0002NZ87U
"This shirt was a nice surprise at the low cost.  It fit perfectly and the fabric is very fine and soft.  A great buy, wish they would have had more colors.",B0002NZ87U
"This shirt runs quite boxy and long- I am 5'4"" and 148 lbs. Not a flattering women's fit as shown in the picture. The fabric is a small mesh/waffle weave which I am fine with.  I was hoping to order multiple ones for work but I will not be ordering another one. Sorry.",B0002NZ87U
Love the shirts I ordered. Great selection of color choices. Fits perfectly.,B0002NZ87U
These shirts fits perfect. I purchased a medium and it fits great. Will buy again. Love these shirts.,B0002NZ87U
"The fabric is nice, but the shirt is too short. I haven't washed it yet but I have easily 2 inches of extra fabric on each side and the length is about 3 inches too short. Keeping it for around the house, but won't wear in public because the second you lift your arms it's a belly shirt.",B0002NZ87U
The fabric is great and fit was just what I wanted. I need to buy this shirt in several more colors.,B0002NZ87U
I like port authority classic knit collar polo shirt the coffee bean color is nice.,B0002NZ87U
Great color as see in the picture.  Good quality.,B0002NZ87U
"Nice shirt, but very long.  There is no way I can wear it out and there's a lot of bulk to tuck in.",B0002NZ87U
"This shirt color and texture is fine.  The fit is too large in the torso, shoulders matronly .  Not to my liking at all.",B0002NZ87U
cotton beads and have to throw them away and the color has faded even with careful washing and drying.,B0002NZ87U
I liked the shirt and it fit as I expected.  The colour is exactly as pictured on the computer.  Thanks,B0002NZ87U
"Runs small and can not dry as it draws up done
Color was perfect.  Would have liked a material that gives more",B0002NZ87U
"Shirt was good quality; color was as expected. The shirt was nice, but masculine cut and WAY too big. It's a disappointment.",B0002NZ87U
excellent choice liked my wife and helped a lot to correct their dress .... the texture of the fabric is wonderful and very soft,B0002NZ87U
I would have prefered it to be a bit more roomy but it turned out to be a perfect fit,B0002NZ87U
"Love the fabric.  It washes and dries wonderfully.  I like it so well, I think I will purchase another in a different color..",B0002NZ87U
These shirts run small and are on the shorter side.  Good for short body people but should order one size larger than your normal size.  Very nice shirts though.,B0002NZ87U
It was marked as 1X plus which should have fit fine.  This product fit the same as just a 1X product.  I was not satisfied.,B0002NZ87U
"Love  the way it fits!
It is just long enough and the arms are not to short!!",B0002NZ87U
"Yes my mother was happy, thank you ",B0002NZ87U
"The material is soft, not hot and doesn't seem to wrinkle a lot.",B0002NZ87U
excellent replacement work shirt will be purchasing again,B0002NZ87U
Holds up to lots of washing though I only fluff in the dryer.  No fading or shrinking plus it's the only polo shirt I've found that breathes.,B0002NZ87U
Washes and wears well. I don't fully dry before hanging; has not shrunk or faded.,B0002NZ87U
They fit perfect and I love them material so soft. Very pleased.,B0002NZ87U
I loved my PORT AUTHORITY polo the sizing was great.  I had ordered another polo a differed brand at the same time (Port Authoritu ded noy offer my color) and the sizing was off).  I am expectin a refund for that one and will reorder another PORT AUTHORITY Polo.  Great fit and the fabric and color are also first quality.,B0002NZ898
I bought my size but it was to big.  Same size as every other shirt in my closet.  I was disappointed.  did not want to hassle to sent it back.,B0002NZ898
"Nice Fit Comfortable. Good for work and home. Enjoy the material, Good for the price. Dont wash in washer it does shrink",B0002NZ898
"I hate wearing polo shirts that look like I'm just wearing a smaller size of a man's polo shirt.  Unfortunately, a fitted polo doesn't exist unless you also want it to be skin-tight or really short (some even shrink significantly after a wash/dry).  I need to look professional for work...and like a woman.",B0002NZ898
very nice shirt would rate it with shirts costing twice as much. would highly recamend them. theses shirt come in many colors,B0002NZ898
"The shirt is a good fit and comfortable to move around in.  Not the best at staying tucked in due to length, but doesn't look terrible if it does.",B0002NZ898
"Shirt not silk touch, rather a cheap cotton blend that is rough to the touch.",B0002NZ898
"Great polo shirts! I had read reviews and some were stating that they were ""boxy"", I must be ""boxy"" lol!! Fit as expected",B0002NZ898
Its supposed to be the silk touch shirt but it is not its more of a cotton shirt.,B0002NZ898
Like this work shirt very comfortable,B0002NZ898
The color is exactly the color I expected terd. The texture of the material is not.,B0002NZ898
"Beautiful top, perfect fit, nice drape!",B0002NZ898
Nice material; not impressed with the color.  Slightly smaller than I expected.,B0002NZ898
Too small. Color is pretty. The large fits like a medium would. Not like the size chart recommended,B0002NZ898
I LOVE the color..... lightweight shirt. washes well.,B0002NZ898
Not totally flattering but serviceable.,B0002NZ898
Fit just as expected and is nice quality.,B0002NZ898
Size was smaller than expected.  Lightweight which is what I wanted them for.  Material is a bit rough.,B0002NZ898
"I love these shirts, I buy them and then have them monogrammed with my work logo. The size runs a little big, a small fits more like a medium, I typically wear a medium but I had to purchase small in these shirts so def size down, at least thats how it happened for me. Im 51 and 140lbs, small fits great, still fits a little loose so if you are looking for a fitted shirt then you would prob have to go down two sizes.",B0002NZ898
Like colored buttons and the fit.,B0002NZ898
"I like the green color, that it's longer, and not fitted in the hips to make them look like saddlebags. Light-weight enough for 100 days. I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs and ordered a XS. Seems to have shrunk a little after 5+ washes so that it's a bit snug in the shoulders. Maybe a small would have been better, but I wouldn't have wanted it any longer than it is.",B0002NZ898
"It is a bit large, but I still like it.  Tuck it in, and it looks good.",B0002NZ898
The most comfortable polo shirts I've found yet!,B0002NZ898
So happy to finally find a golf shirt that fits well and isn't hot!,B0002NZ898
I wanted XXL. Accidently put in XL.,B0002NZ898
"Color matched the picture and made in quality fabric, ran a little big though.",B0002NZ898
Very pleased with this purchase.,B0002NZ898
"Love the color, and fits nicely, but the definition 'Silk Touch' is really not accurate.  Knit is larger than I had expected.",B0002NZ898
Love the shirt abd the quality of the material. Very little shrinkage if any,B0002NZ898
Really soft and good color choices.  Runs a little wide,B0002NZ898
"Bought based on the size charts. I would say the cut is more 'roomy' than a standard ladies polo. Also compared to other Polo's I own, I would not call this a 'Silk Touch'; It is definitely lighter than a standard polo but is still a standard cotton style material.",B0002NZ898
"color matches what I expected, not crazy soft but feels like some of my other polos so no complaints on that. Pro: spilled some coffee on it within 15 minutes of wearing but was able to brush it off and it didn't leave a mark at all. Con: the tag is itchy and that isn't normally an issue for me. I'll be removing the tag when I get home. I washed it before I wore it too.",B0002NZ898
I am normally a L in women clothing. I read the reviews about the fit so I ordered a M. I should have ordered a S. The sizing of these shirts are so far off than normal clothing. The fit is very square and looks horrible tucked in due to the amount of extra fabric. Will never order again,B0002NZ898
"Very comfortable, the length is just right, good quality. I kept ordering different  brands and wasn't  satisfied with any of them until I found this one.",B0002NZ898
The fabric is pretty thin.... won't be ordering any more.,B0002NZ898
Love the color. The shirt is well made with nice button detail,B0002NZ898
"I love the fit and color of this polo. I purchased the eggplant (dark purple) in an XL and it fit me just as it should. I like the polo so much, I bought two more in tropical pink and light pink. The fabric is light and airy (perfect for hot days at the office). I was wondering whether I'd like the polyester/cotton blend but I like it just fine. It is soft and there's a slight mesh knit to the shirt. If you hold it up to the light you can almost see through it, but when I am wearing it with an appropriate bra, you can't see anything untoward. Great shirt in a fabulous range of colors for the price.",B0002NZ898
Great for the high school uniform.,B0002NZ898
nice material..fit true to size,B0002NZ898
Ordered a L received a M - disappointing.,B0002NZ898
"It Fit as expected - but only because I ordered up a size and glad I did.  The XXL fit like 1X usually fits.  Overall a pretty nice shirt. It washes well, didn't shrink - but I line dry, so not sure if it would have shrunk in the dryer.  Wish these companies would get a uniform sizing figured out.",B0002NZ898
"The fit is very boxy. I bought 4 colours in size small. All fit the same, loose under the arms(bust 34C). I am pear shaped so the shirt sits comfortably on my 42inch hip. I am contemplating trying to put bust darts in to improve the fit. The arms are loose too, but I have thin arms. If you like a closer fit you might want to go down a size.
 The colours are vibrant. The hibiscus looks more like a neon orange, I really do not like it, looks nothing like the pinkish colour advertised. I am probably going to give this one away and order another colour. The other colours, cool grey, teal green, and the deep berry seem like the colours on the screen. The cool grey and the hibiscus did not run when I rinsed them, but the teal and berry colour did.
 The material is not heavy, and since I will be working in hot conditions this is ideal. The shirts are not see through. Fabric feels smooth to the touch, soft, not coarse at all.",B0002NZ898
Love the soft feel of the cotton.  It didn't shrink in the wash either.  I will definitely buy more.,B0002NZ898
It fit fine for my 11 year old daughter aside from the fact that it took almost two weeks to arrive.,B0002NZ898
I love the Polo shirts from this company. I buy them for my daughter who has to wear them for school and she's a bit overweight and they fit her perfectly.,B0002NZ898
"Looks ok and does the job. However, they don't wash well and the collar constantly rolls.",B0002NZ898
Great product. Fit as expected. I wish it was a little more form fitting.,B0002NZ898
I love the feel of the material. I wash excessively and they have maintained their color well.,B0002NZ898
Very comfortable & material is nicer than expected. Collar is not too stiff & material washes perfectly - no wrinkles even after leaving in dryer.,B0002NZ898
Perhaps should have ordered one size down. Prefer a bit large to a bit small. Will know better next time.,B0002NZ898
What I ordered ran big in this color. I ordered Royal blue and it was true to size.,B0002NZ898
Had a promo shirt from work and love it so much.  Retired now and so glad I found these.  Wear like iron.,B0002NZ898
Very comfy. Will order more in different colors,B0002NZ898
Fabric was VERY thin.  You can see light through two layers of shirt if you hold it up. Worked okay though because it is a dark color.,B0002NZ898
"Good quality, but runs a little large, but very comfortable. I would buy it again!",B0002NZ898
Love the light weight fabric.  Great fit and wrinkle guard.,B0002NZ898
Had used this company for many years and the product is excellent. Wash and wear and seems never to wear out.,B0002NZ898
Fabric is good. Runs a little large. Will buy a size down next time.,B0002NZ898
Great fit and fun color.  I'll definitely be buying again.,B0002NZ898
Fits as expected.  Great for work. Ready to order more.,B0002NZ898
Relaxed fit very comfortable.  Great Work shirt!,B0002NZ898
Can't possibly be sized correctly,B0002NZ898
"Very nice shirt, soft and fits as expected.  After washing it retained its shape. Would recommend.",B0002NZ898
"It is a nice shirt, the fit is just fine. Happy to find an olive color polo shirt!",B0002NZ898
Very comfortable and wash great.,B0002NZ898
not that well constructed has already snagged.,B0002NZ898
Excellent quality for the price,B0002NZ898
I purchased 4 for work and I would highly recommend. Great fit and great quality.,B0002NZ898
"Fits well. Took forever to get here. About two weeks. However, I should have read the makeup of the material. This is 65% Polyester and 35% cotton and it is miserably hot. I bought for field days for work and I can't wear it. The pit stains are horrible.",B0002NZ898
I ordered the Banana yellow and the Ultramarine blue both in small. The blue fits great and fit even better after a wash. It's a comfortable relax fit polo but still looks professional and polished. The yellow however did not do well after a wash. The fabric looks and feels a bit different from the blue and it's much wider.,B0002NZ898
"Fits just the way I wanted it to and arrived 2 days early. Fabric is softer than I expected, too.",B0002NZ898
"Doesn't wrinkle, really nice color.  A bit on the snug side and warm.  I won't wear it to work due to it not being cooler.",B0002NZ898
"Love the fit because it's not ""fitted"" and more relaxed for a polo shirt which is hard to find. Definitely long enough to tuck in and fold out over pants for professional wear.",B0002NZ898
"First off, I HATE polo shirts. The material is usually too hot, the necks are usually too scratchy and tight, and they just look dorky. However, my job requires a blue polo and I didn't want to buy extra shirts through the company because I didn't want to spend a lot on something I'm just going to wear to work. These shirts exceeded my expectations. The fabric is lightweight, the collar doesn't feel like a noose, and they actually look nice. I get hot easily on my job, so comfort is a must. If you have a job that just requires a solid colored polo, get one of these. You won't regret it.",B0002NZ898
"Love the material,love the color; however it is larger than I expected.  All the polo shirts I own are large and fit better than this one.  I am 5'4"" and weigh 145#.  I should have ordered medium.",B0002NZ898
Great fit.  Keeps size and shape after wasing/drying.,B0002NZ898
"A little large in size,  otherwise great",B0002NZ898
"Thin, see through material. The point was to have a light weight shirt for the summer. If I have to wear another shirt underneath, it defeats the purpose.",B0002NZ898
The neck label was scratchy but otherwise I love this shirt!,B0002NZ898
"This says silk touch, but it's more like a knit. Comfortable, but not a dri fit. Nice shirt for the money.",B0002NZ898
Ordered a Medium and it's Waay too big.  The description says silky - but the material is more textured and bumpy.  Still a nice shirt and I will wear it to work with a lite jacket.,B0002NZ898
Bought them for the girls in the restaurant..They all fit great and the girls love them. I also have some and I love mine..they are soft and fit great and they wasshed great with no shrinking...,B0002NZ898
"Good quality and fit as expected.  However, I would like it better if the material was a little thicker.",B0002NZ898
"Nice quality, great fit, and kept shape with very little shrinkage. I will continue to buy this product.",B0002NZ898
"Good quality material. Thick cotton Polo with more of a men's fit. The eggplant is a deep purple. I'm 5'7"" and 145 lbs with a pear shape, fits well. Pleased for a work shirt.",B0002NZ898
Have purchased Port Authority many times..an excellent wearing shirt,B0002NZ898
It's a tad smaller but still fits I like it .,B0002NZ898
Perfect for my serving job. Nice and cool. Dries quick as well. Color true to pic. Great price.,B0002NZ898
Loved it!!! I think I should have gotten a size smaller. I got a Medium. I'm very petite and I like clothes to fit tightly around my body. But you it's just a uniform work shirt so it'll do.,B0002NZ898
Great quality and a great price!,B0002NZ898
"Once I got over the XXL, thanks to the many reviewers who said these run small. I do love wearing them. Had them embroidered with my business logo. Beautiful!!",B0002NZ898
"I ordered the Kelly green & Steel polo shirts both shirts arrived in good condition.  Fabric was thinner than I thought it would be, it's not see through but if I held the shirt up toward a lamp/light (about 10' away) I could see lamp light through the fabric.  FWIW, I don't typically do this with my other shirts/blouses; whatever I did was a fluke, but thought it worth mentioning.  Lastly, I didn't think the shirts were as soft as the description implies, once washed & dried w/ dryer sheet, then yes, nice & soft.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the tops; so much so, I ordered the sunflower yellow (received today), purple, & strong blue.",B0002NZ898
"I bought this shirt for work. I normally wear a medium but after reading the reviews, decided to order a small. The shirt is still way too large and very shapeless. It fits more like a man's shirt than a ladies'. There is also a small brown stain on the left shoulder. Very disappointed. Requested a refund. We will see how long it takes to go through.",B0002NZ898
"I love the shirt and would be glad to order more in the future but, the seam came loose on one of the sleeves already. that's a bit too  fast I would think.",B0002NZ898
It's okay however I will not be buying another one. The quality of the shirt isn't what i expected and don't really know how well it will hold up after a few washes.,B0002NZ898
"Holds up well through numerous laundry procedures, very silky feel.  Ships FAST!",B0002NZ898
"I read reviews on this item and did not see one for the X-Large sizes, so I followed the reviews and ordered a size smaller, not wanting to be swimming in an oversize shirt at work.  But I found that in this size, it is probably better to go up a size instead of down one.  It is also very short.  That could be attributed to the tight fit. But the measurement from the neckline is 28.5 inches.  Other than that the shirt appears to be of good quality.",B0002NZ898
The size said can all but I got a size large or bigger.,B0002NZ898
Beautiful color.....tempted to buy another one!,B0002NZ898
"I have always liked Port Authority polo shirts, but for some reason these faded quickly.",B0002NZ898
"Too boxy, thought it would be more fitted like on the model.",B0002NZ898
"I have had the same 3 shirts for 3 years now. I got them for work and they have done very well. The only thing I have had to do in those 3 years is sew on a button that fell off. If you work at a company that requires you to use polo shirts, get this!!",B0002NZ898
Perfect Fit.  It washes & wears well!,B0002NZ898
Nice color as expected and fits well with the bottom I had in mind!,B0002NZ898
"Great polo for the money.  Runs a bit large, I feel.  Fabric feels nice and doesn't wrinkle. Definately will use as a work shirt.  But Port Authority, for crying out loud, invest in the taggless technology.  Itchy tags are so yesterday.",B0002NZ898
ORDER A SIZE LESS. THE COLORS ARE VERY PRETTY,B0002NZ898
They do not hold up to wear. And the color fades fast.,B0002NZ898
"itis a nice shirt, just didn't fit asI expected",B0002NZ898
"Way too big and long....
Purchased the Medium size I normally wear, but it seems a size bigger.
Very upset about it.",B0002NZ898
"I was conflicted with the sizing reviews so I felt it necessary to submit my input.  I am typically a size small.  I wear a size 4 usually and am a 34B chest.  I bought both the XS and the Small in three different colors and the XS fit perfectly with room to spare.  The shoulders fit well and the length did too (I'm 5'8"" with a long torso).  It wasn't too tight across the chest and it wasn't exactly fitted down the sizes but because it hit at a reasonably length and had the side tails, I will wear this tucked out and still look professional.  It's a bit on the thinner side for a polo but it's not see through.  Decently made.",B0002NZ898
Washes and wears well. Durable material.,B0002NZ898
"Can't beat the quality for the price. Isn't terribly form fitting, but not awkwardly baggy.",B0002NZ898
"Washes well, fabric quality is very good.",B0002NZ898
The material feels wonderful and the shirt fits well.,B0002NZ898
"nice polo, but a little smaller than I anticipated. tight cut in armpits.",B0002NZ898
"I ordered a Small based off the size chart and it's huge. The size chart says the bust measurement for a small is something like 34-36in. I measured the actual shirt and it's 19.5in across the chest so it has a bust measurement of 40in total. It's very baggy. The sleeves are really long for short sleeves? They fall like 3/4 of the way to my elbow. I'm not sure why it's called a ""ladies"" polo because it's cut to be straight i.e. it doesn't taper in towards the waist at all. The only acceptable way for me to wear it and look ""put together"" would be to tuck it in, but then you can still tell it's really big because of how long the sleeves are.",B0002NZ898
"This is a very nice top, especially given the reasonable price. I've already bought one and am planning on buying a few more. The one I bought seemed to run a little small, though, so I'm going to order up a size next time.",B0002NZ898
The banana yellow color was exactly what they showed in the picture. Like a pale baby yellow. Very comfortable material.,B0002NZ898
Fits perfect and is super soft. Might have to order another one!!,B0002NZ898
I like this shirt it is very comfortable. It fits very well.,B0002NZ898
Great color:  it's not easy to find teal.,B0002NZ898
Color is a lot lighter than pictured.,B0002NZ898
"These port authority shirts are the best! They're great quality, wear well, come out of the dryer with no wrinkles and are very affordable! I love them for work! I have lots of colors!",B0002NZ898
"I am usually a women's large but these run a little big so I bought a medium, which fits well. I gave 4 stars because they do shrink up in length in washing. I ordered the Maui Blue which does not match the photo very well, it's more of a bright blue turquoise but I guess I can live with it. I also ordered dark gray, which matches the description. These are great for work so I am happy with them and the price is right. I used to buy old navy polos but those have way too much stretch to them, which these do not. Recommend to buy a size down and expect them to shrink a bit in length, otherwise, perfect!",B0002NZ898
"Wonderful polo, fits well, material better than expected",B0002NZ898
"Great Color! Feels wonderful, fits great! I bought 8 of them!",B0002NZ898
XS is perfect for me. I am a small person and women's 0-2 are often to big. I don't like to go to the JR section to buy clothes because they are too clingy. I will end up buying more colors so I can where them to work.,B0002NZ898
Nice material...but runs large.,B0002NZ898
Perfect fit perfect shade of red.,B0002NZ898
Cut of the shirt feels masculine.,B0002NZ898
Product is not the smoothest or silkiest polo that I have had. Because of the name I expected smoother fabric. Other than that I like it very much..,B0002NZ898
I was just disappointed that the pink one didn't come in.  I am working in Afghanistan so white/beige will become dirty very quickly.,B0002NZ898
The polo arrived just as expected. The item is as described and a great value.,B0002NZ898
"The quality of the shirt was great, the size looked more like a large than a small. Because of the quality and the price, I decided to give it another try, and ordered an 'extra small'.  It hasn't come yet, but will let you know how that works.",B0002NZ898
"I was excited to see polos for women in plus sizes!  Love the variety of colors.  Upon arrival I noticed that these were way too short.  Unless you want your muffin top to show, don't waste your money on these.",B0002NZ898
The shirts are perfect for work.,B0002NZ898
A little small but the colors are perfect for my work,B0002NZ898
"I was expecting a bit heavier material, but overall this is a very nice casual shirt.",B0002NZ898
"I love the way they fit, just a tiny bit small.",B0002NZ898
Great shirt. The purple is true to color on website. I ordered one size up (XXL) in order to have extra room in the sleeves. The regular XL fits fine but the sleeves give no extra room to wear a long sleeve shirt underneath.,B0002NZ898
Not silk feel. I would return but not worth it.,B0002NZ898
"Excellent shirt. Looks professional, fits great and wonderfully priced! Bought three!",B0002NZ898
I love it fits great & like the fabric nice & comfy,B0002NZ898
Very soft with a nice fit.  Especially like the buttons.,B0002NZ898
Needed for work....Fit as expected..same color as 1 free shirt given for dress code....can wear a t shirt under it!.....Will order again,B0002NZ898
Good and comfortable.  Washes very well,B0002NZ898
Super short.. Above the belt..granted we ordered xxl sizing should be a bit more proportionate,B0002NZ898
"Does NOT have a silk touch, either.  The only thing I like is the color.",B0002NZ898
I ordered these same shirts a while back and they were so much nicer.  These have a real small sleeve-fits tightly.  They just aren't the quality I expected.,B0002NZ898
Comfortable. Fits right. Bought it for my school uniform & color matched. Happy with purchase.,B0002NZ898
"It was a gift for my sister. I have gotten her the white ones for work and since they fit so well, I bought some in different colors for casual wear",B0002NZ898
"I love these shirts for work.  I now have 7 different  colors.  They fit as they should.  They are well made and have held up to weekly washings since September 1st.  Colors are still pure.  They come out of the dryer wrinkle free.  I will say that they come with a stitched in tag in the neck that I cut out because I cannot stand the feel.  Once the tag is gone, I'm good to go.  They are soft and comfortable.  I'm planning on adding more colors soon.",B0002NZ898
I love the Port Authority Silk Touch Polo shirts!  They fit nice and wash up great!  I've had some for 6-7 years...and they still look great!,B0002NZ898
This is a work uniform. I can't bring myself to give it five stars because I have to wear it. Mandatory uniforms are the worst!,B0002NZ898
This shirt is big in the shoulders.  The color is perfect.,B0002NZ898
"Just received this shirt yesterday. I own ALOT of polo shirts to wear for work. I am an Athletic Trainer and travel with a college sports team. It's important to me to get a shirt that fits well, doesn't fade, shrink, or snag. I am usually a size L or XL in unisex size t-shirts or ladies size 14/16. Upon measuring myself and looking at the size chart I decided to order an XXL. It fits as well as it could. If your a small petite woman keep in mind this shirt isn't overly fitted. I'm larger though and my only wish is that it would be slightly longer so I could tuck it in. However, it is long enough for me to raise my hands over my head and not have my stomach show.  The texture of the shirt is only slightly more sheer than a 100% cotton polo. I would NOT consider it a silk texture like in the title. However, It does show bra lines. I don't think this will snag too easily unlike some 100% polyester shirts (this shirt is 65% polyester 35% cotton). I do wish the styling was more feminine. The front where it buttons down is large like a mans and only has three buttons. Care instructions say to wash in cold water and dry on low so I am fearful I will shrink it by accidently putting it through the dryer on medium or high heat.  Only time will tell if this shrinks, snags, or fades. I'll update my review if the shirt doesn't hold up adequately. Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this shirt, however, it isn't my favorite polo!",B0002NZ898
Very comfortable and fit to size,B0002NZ898
"This is the shirt that is part of our dress requirement for work.  I love the way it fits and the way it launders.  I work in a nursing home where the thermostat is always higher than comfort for me.  These shirts help me stay cool, and they are light.  The term silk is sort of misleading.  I wasn't sure about ""silk"", but found it is only a feel-like silk.",B0002NZ898
"The material is on the thin side.  It's fine for the summer.  Also, it is too boxy for my taste.  I bought it because the price is right and I have to wear collard shirts at my job.",B0002NZ898
fits very well ... soft material ... very comfortable,B0002NZ898
"Shorter length, needed to be a little longer.",B0002NZ898
I really liked the quality of the shirt and have ordered in several other colors.,B0002NZ898
"I thought the fabric would be silky, but it's not. It's just fabric nothing special but isn't scratchy. It's okay for a work shirt.",B0002NZ898
Arrived on time and very pleased on the fit too.,B0002NZ898
"I love these shirts. They look nice, wash well and keep looking good. They are very comfortable.",B0002NZ898
"When its called Silk Touch, I assumed dri-fit material but its cotton.  I guess that's what I get for assuming!  Overall, it fits as expected and is a nice shirt, just not what I was expecting.",B0002NZ898
"Wished they could be longer, nice shirt",B0002NZ898
Light color... not soft clothing. It states silk touch; not sure what they were talking about.,B0002NZ898
The material is soft and it washes nicely.,B0002NZ898
"Purchased this in size Womens Large. Received a Mens size Large, which is a totally different cut and style than a Womens shirt.
Also, this shirt is soft, but REALLY thin and totally see through. Plan to wear a shirt or tank top under it or you will be showing off everything!
I am not happy at all!!!",B0002NZ898
"A bit small, didn't know how to return them, I gave them both away???",B0002NZ898
I ordered this shirt in court green. The color is very vibrant and beautiful. I love the feel and quality of the shirt as well. Would defiantly order again in the future.,B0002NZ898
"I would not recommend purchasing this shirt.  It is not silk touch.  The fabric is rough and it's so thin, it's almost see-thru.  I ordered the medium, but probably should have gotten a large.  It runs small through the shoulders.  This is a very poor quality item.  I got it on sale for $8.99 and it's not even worth that much.",B0002NZ898
"Decent quality, neutral color.  I will probably buy it again.",B0002NZ898
Great feel to the material. Loved the colors,B0002NZ898
I love this Polo shirt. It is so soft and it fits perfectly.,B0002NZ898
"I typically wear either a L or XL in polos.  I thought I'd try the XL in this brand.  Nope, should have gone XXL.",B0002NZ898
I had to do some alterations as the medium size shirt was larger than I expected.  Otherwise I like the style and colors.,B0002NZ898
Way too baggy. Looks pretty much like your wearing a sack,B0002NZ898
"Not too crazy about the material, doesn't hold neat shape.",B0002NZ898
I wear them everyday! Love them. Very comfortable.,B0002NZ898
I always wait until I wash the item before I make any comments. The shirt fit perfect and after one washing and drying still fit perfect. I am very happy with my purchase.,B0002NZ898
Great product and so inexpensive,B0002NZ898
I work in the hospitality business and and i love these shirts! They get washed often and hold up really well. Great price too!,B0002NZ898
"I expected it to shrink and it didn't. I should have bought a small and not a medium. Good quality, soft cotton. Holding up well.",B0002NZ898
Nice shirt. Great for the value.,B0002NZ898
The shirt is as expected.  I need orange polo shirts for work because orange is part of our school colors. It seems well made and not cheap.  It fits well.  Satisfied so far.,B0002NZ898
Other than size it's a great buy.,B0002NZ898
could have used a little more room thru the middle,B0002NZ898
"very nice quality, color and size very accurate",B0002NZ898
Good buy. Nice quality for the price.,B0002NZ898
"Nice color, ordered xxl was given xl. Not happy!",B0002NZ898
Got this for work; comfortable and fits well though I noticed some slight fabric changes with only 2 washes where the material rubs against my bra,B0002NZ898
"The fit is a tiny bit snug, but good construction. I was disappointed in the color. The tropical pink is a little muddy and a few shades off Pepto Bismol pink",B0002NZ898
"It looks nice.
Washes and hangs dry without ironing.
Perfect for work",B0002NZ898
Great value. It's hard to find a well made polo for an affordable price. The color selections are awesome.,B0002NZ898
Found that going up one size made this polo a perfect fit!,B0002NZ898
"loved this shirt! ok so it doesn't feel like silk but it isn't as rough as other polo shirts, ordering more!",B0002NZ898
Based on some other's comments I ordered a size larger.  It was closer to being 2 sizes too big.  Because I have large hips I normally wear a 1X but ordered a 2X.  I should have ordered an XL.  The quality is great - I washed it in hopes of shrinking but it didn't shrink.  It is a very nice shirt I just wish I'd ordered a smaller size.  Since I washed it I can't return it so now I've got to find someone who can wear it.,B0002NZ898
A little lighter weight fabric than what I expected.,B0002NZ898
"I ordered several (14) of these shirts in different colors.  The ones made in China are the correct size, Women's 2XL the ones made in Vietnam are too small (Ladies XL).",B0002NZ898
"Nice shirt, it does not shrink and is long.",B0002NZ898
Fits as expected. Looks more expensive than it is.  Good bargain,B0002NZ898
This shirt is made of good quality material that washes well.  It is long enough so that everything stays covered.  One downsize is that the tag is quite itchy even after removing it.  I prefer the stamped on type of tag.,B0002NZ898
Perfectly fit as expected...material is ok..!!!,B0002NZ898
Color different than I expected.,B0002NZ898
Great product. Just what we wanted,B0002NZ898
"I wear it to work for casual days. The material is thin, but that adds to the attractiveness for me.",B0002NZ898
Very quick and satisfactory resolution when contacted about the item being to big.,B0002NZ898
"Good quality but the fit is a little small, the large fit more like a medium.",B0002NZ898
I really like polo shirts and wasn't disappointed with this one.  I am using the green and blue for a prayer group.  Had the name printed and I'm happy.,B0002NZ898
"It arrived just as advertised. I find the Port Authority tops are a true fit, comfortable, and wears well.",B0002NZ898
"as is indicated as the time of arrival was the product has reached me, excellent",B0002NZ898
Comfortable and durable.  Can't beat the price.,B0002NZ898
"Very happy with fabric, size, color",B0002NZ898
"I ordered a small and got more like a XL. Wasn't true to the color in the picture, it was more dull.",B0002NZ898
I really liked them will order again,B0002NZ898
I've ordered a large dark green women's shirt and I've received a large light green men's shirt. It is not even close to what I've ordered. Very upset because I needed it for work.,B0002NZ898
"What else can I say, I love it.",B0002NZ898
I wear a x-l but it was a little tight.,B0002NZ898
"I love the color and even though it is too big, it is very comfortable and looks nice.",B0002NZ898
"I was disappointed with color. Understanding irbid impossible to truly depict color given differences in viewing devices, I expected a deeper color. It was paler than I expected. A little faded looming.",B0002NZ898
"This shirt was a nice surprise at the low cost.  It fit perfectly and the fabric is very fine and soft.  A great buy, wish they would have had more colors.",B0002NZ898
"This shirt runs quite boxy and long- I am 5'4"" and 148 lbs. Not a flattering women's fit as shown in the picture. The fabric is a small mesh/waffle weave which I am fine with.  I was hoping to order multiple ones for work but I will not be ordering another one. Sorry.",B0002NZ898
Love the shirts I ordered. Great selection of color choices. Fits perfectly.,B0002NZ898
These shirts fits perfect. I purchased a medium and it fits great. Will buy again. Love these shirts.,B0002NZ898
"The fabric is nice, but the shirt is too short. I haven't washed it yet but I have easily 2 inches of extra fabric on each side and the length is about 3 inches too short. Keeping it for around the house, but won't wear in public because the second you lift your arms it's a belly shirt.",B0002NZ898
The fabric is great and fit was just what I wanted. I need to buy this shirt in several more colors.,B0002NZ898
I like port authority classic knit collar polo shirt the coffee bean color is nice.,B0002NZ898
Great color as see in the picture.  Good quality.,B0002NZ898
"Nice shirt, but very long.  There is no way I can wear it out and there's a lot of bulk to tuck in.",B0002NZ898
"This shirt color and texture is fine.  The fit is too large in the torso, shoulders matronly .  Not to my liking at all.",B0002NZ898
cotton beads and have to throw them away and the color has faded even with careful washing and drying.,B0002NZ898
I liked the shirt and it fit as I expected.  The colour is exactly as pictured on the computer.  Thanks,B0002NZ898
"Runs small and can not dry as it draws up done
Color was perfect.  Would have liked a material that gives more",B0002NZ898
"Shirt was good quality; color was as expected. The shirt was nice, but masculine cut and WAY too big. It's a disappointment.",B0002NZ898
excellent choice liked my wife and helped a lot to correct their dress .... the texture of the fabric is wonderful and very soft,B0002NZ898
I would have prefered it to be a bit more roomy but it turned out to be a perfect fit,B0002NZ898
"Love the fabric.  It washes and dries wonderfully.  I like it so well, I think I will purchase another in a different color..",B0002NZ898
These shirts run small and are on the shorter side.  Good for short body people but should order one size larger than your normal size.  Very nice shirts though.,B0002NZ898
It was marked as 1X plus which should have fit fine.  This product fit the same as just a 1X product.  I was not satisfied.,B0002NZ898
"Love these shirts sizing is true, they feel good on and they wash beautifully. What more could you ask for. My goal is to have one of each color.",B0002NZ898
"The shirt arrived looking just like the picture, but it was a bit bigger than I had anticipated. I probably should have ordered a medium instead of a large.",B0002NZ898
Polo fits great and washes up nicely.  No wrinkles on the Port Authority polos.  I have three different colors now.,B0002NZ898
"I wanted this shirt because of the color, Shirt fit well and it goes great with lot of color/things. Great looking shirt!.",B0002NZ898
Holds up to lots of washing though I only fluff in the dryer.  No fading or shrinking plus it's the only polo shirt I've found that breathes.,B0002NZ898
Washes and wears well. I don't fully dry before hanging; has not shrunk or faded.,B0002NZ898
They fit perfect and I love them material so soft. Very pleased.,B0002NZ898
"It worked great, but it does shrink a little so maybe get a size up than you usually would",B0002NZ898
Ok. Didnt keep its shape after first wash. Still a good shirt for the weekend/errands but I won't wear it back to work.,B0002NZ898
Definitely not soft... and was a bit small.,B0002NZ898
The port authority silk touch came as expected and  pretty much fit as expected. It is NOT however a silk touch shirt as I expected it to be.  I ordered this one for my wife. I have ordered several directly from the company and not had an issue so Im not sure what happened here. But there sure is regular cotton shirt. Which is what I did not want because I did not want a shirt but is going to fade and shrink up short and wide. I was expecting the silk like golf shirt material.,B0002NZ898
"A very nice, thick shirt. Quality is excellent. I was skeptical of the brand, as I had never heard of it, but I decided to give it a try and I was very pleasantly surprised. My husband is very picky about how his shirts feel & fit (soft, but not too thin & slightly loose) and he approves of this shirt completely.",B0002NZ5CS
Shirt wrinkle a lot and are hard to press.,B0002NZ5CS
I love this durable shirt.  It is made of nice thick breathable cotton.,B0002NZ5CS
"Fit well, but two others from other makers were sized small.... so it's a crap shoot.  Nice quality and color.  We'll see how it holds up.",B0002NZ5CS
"Fits well, comfortable. Color needs some tweaking, looks almost black rather than blue. Made in Vietnam.",B0002NZ5CS
"Textile is OK, but the shirt is too big. I use XL size, but Large size at this product could be more than enough.",B0002NZ5CS
"This seems to be a good quality shirt, but it comes out of the dryer incredibly wrinkled.  Unless you want to be constantly ironing, I recommend the ""Port Authority Men's Short Sleeve Easy Care Dress Shirt"", which I ordered at the same time (because it had a color I liked) and really is ""Easy Care"".",B0002NZ5CS
Great shirt. 100% cotton. Husband needs shirts that don't melt. ... its comfortable and looks sharp.,B0002NZ5CS
Just slightly small.  Otherwise a well made shirt.,B0002NZ5CS
Needs ironing every time you wash it.,B0002NZ5CS
"a little tighter in the shoulders than I expected, but I can live with it",B0002NZ5CS
"This is a great shirt. It fits fine and I love the color. It's 100% cotton, so we are careful to pull it out of the dryer quickly and reduce the need for ironing.",B0002NZ5CS
i really like the shirt. It does wrinkle but i still like it.,B0002NZ5CS
"I love the weight of these shirts. I starting getting them from the agency I work for with our logo on them. When I ruined one I cut off the sleeves and use it for a work shirt. The weight of the shirt, and the ventilation from cutting off the sleeves keeps it from sticking to me so much when I'm working.",B0002NZ5CS
I love this shirt. Very nice weight and beautiful color.  Have washed it and no shrinking. Color did not seem to fade.  I will order more of this brand.,B0002NZ19A
I bought these as an anonymous gift for someone in need.  I was very impressed with the weight and thickness of the cotton for the price.  I would recommend these to someone looking for a nice weight T-Shirt.,B0002NZ2VW
Ok for work. But order a size larger,B0002NZC6C
"We purchased two of these shirts for our twin daughters. They are super soft, wash well,hold their shape,seem very comfortable, and our picky dressers love them.",B0002NZGY0
"I bought one to take with me on a trip to Alaska.  It does a great job of keeping you dry without making you hot like some rainwear does. I liked it so much that I bought my wife and my adult son jackets for Christmas. Some reviews mentioned that these were oversized, but all 3 that I ordered were our regular sizes, & they all fit just fine.  I am very pleased with my purchases.",B0002NZRC6
"I was dissapointed with this item. It wasn't, but should have been, listed as a unisex item. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker. When I received it, I realised that this was more likely to fit a man. The sleeves were way too long and wide. Even though there is a velcro strip, when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist,it flares out like a skirt.....not flattering. In my opinion, this jacket would be a much better fit for a man. If you're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman, in any size, I wouldn't reccommend this. I was also dissapointed with the lining. It was a flimsy net. All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket. It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you'd leave in the trunk of your car, but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one.",B0002NZRC6
"The sizing really needs to be updated. The sizes run small so order at least one size up. Also after about four washes, the color started to fade and the shirt looks a bit ragged. I cant wear it anymore to work because its just appears too worn out.",B0002NZEGK
"My husband prefers the Port & Company tees because of the weight of the cotton fabric used.  In addition, the neck manintains its shape and does not stretch out.",B0002NZ1S6
The shirt was somewhat tight fitting for an X-Large and I cannot wear it at this time.,B0002PZVJI
"Steve loves all things Hawaiian and finding him something unique is difficult. This shirt was perfect for his birthday present. Colors are almost exactly what my computer monitor shows, the tailoring quality is excellent and it fits and washes nicely. It did need some touch up ironing along the button placard (if that's the correct term?), collar, and sleeves but that could easily be eliminated by straightening and hanging to dry rather than tumble drying. Depends on a person's preference. I only use fabric softener in the rinse cycle of the washing machine because dryer sheets can gum up the dryer and cause fire - and I don't like to iron. There are a few of Steve's shirts that bunch up at the open neck so I smooth/shape them on a hanger coming out of the washer and let them hang dry. This way they look great and don't need ironing.",B0002PZVJI
"I bought this for my husband for a Luau party. I didn't want a ""tacky"" looking shirt. I wanted one he could wear again somewhere. This shirt is quality made, and beautiful colors!",B0002PZVJI
My husband loves the shirt and has gotten lots of compliments on them.,B0002PZVJI
"Love the shirt, material is perfect.  Unfortunately the XL seems to be alittle small. My husband is a XL-XXL depending on shirt. I would have ordered the XXL just to be safe not sorry BUT a XXL wasn't available, so rodered the XL with the hope it would a XL that fit and of course am sorry. Would definitely order again but only XXL.",B0002PZVJI
I am always a bit leery buying cloths on Amazon due to the many ranges of the word XL.  I have bought XL and a 6yr old could wear it to XL meaning welcome to my night gown collection.  This was not that drastic but this is definitely and large XL and is true to its size.  my boyfriend is normally a 34 to 36 and has a nice upper body in his chest area so XL is what i always buy him at AE.  This shirt is a few inches outside of that so very loose on him but still love the shirt.  He has Hawaiian day at work on Fridays and i was so tired of the same ole same ole Hawaiian shirt he would always wear.  he loves this shirt and will wear it with a nice tee shirt under it now.  Thank you and this is a Great seller.,B0002PZVJI
"The Hawaiian Woody shirt was as advertised, The fit size was perfect, the art was work is great. I would recommend the shirt .",B0002PZVJI
I love this shirt! I purchased it for my rabbi to wear to conduct our 10th wedding anniversary vow renewal ceremony and he looked great in it! I think he even liked it and will likely wear it again!,B0002PZVJI
"Arrived in timely manner. Cool shirt. I got the black version for my boyfriend last year after he asked for the blue one. He still wanted the blue one a year later, so now he has both.",B0002PZVK2
Well i final got the item. I will have a great time on saturday at the Hawaiian party now...Item is great and will buy more in time...,B0002PZVK2
"After unpacking the shirt, I said wow..., this is beautiful ....
I am a size L, and this size is perfect for me ... The shirt it's just like in the picture.",B0002PZVK2
"I bought this shirt for my husband, for his birthday, and he loves these shirts. They are beautifully made and easy to care for, and they are beautiful unusual shirts that you don`t see every day. I am going to buy more for him for Christmas.",B0002PZVK2
"I normally wear a XXL T shirt, Dress shirt, causals etc.  Your XXL was more like a L/XL here.  I believe you have to make some suggestions on sizes in your website.  We here in the Mid-West are a bit bigger than most of the people there in Hawaii.  Just a thought.",B0002PZVK2
"Bought this for my ""forever a tourist"" dad, he loved it!!!!",B0002PZVK2
Awesome shirt and nice quality.,B0002PZVK2
Perfect fit and people at work loved it!  Went over well on casual Friday.,B0002PZVK2
A gift for a relative!  It is well liked!,B0002PZVK2
Size person in wheelchair told me to buy.  However it cheered him up.,B0002PZVK2
This Hawaiian shirt is well made and great looking! YOU CANNOT GET A BETTER PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY.,B0002PZVK2
"Beautiful shirt , great quality",B0002PZVK2
"Great shirt, I get many compliments. Fits a tad big compared to the other medium size shirts I buy, I'm 5'7' and 170 lbs.",B0002PZVK2
"Very well made, excellent fit.  Made in the USA, which was a surprise.",B0002PZVK2
Worked perfect for a Hawaiian them gig. Wouldn't wear it personally but nice shirt overall.,B0002PZVK2
Got this for my brother for Christmas and he really likes it. It has been washed quite a few times and seems no worse for wear.,B0002PZVK2
"The shirt is large until you wash it..Then it fits pretty good,I did notice some bleeding of colors after washing it the first time.",B0002PZVK2
"Gave it as a gift, no complaint so far",B0002PZVK2
Like how the pattern matches at the button line.,B0002PZVK2
giving it to my son-in law for his birthday. Know he will love it,B0002PZVK2
"He LOVES this shirt!  Nicely made - you won't be sorry you bought it for him . . . it replaced the orange one with beer bottles all over it. C :
And it is fun to see all the guys at every party comment on it & ask him where he got it.",B0002PZVK2
This shirt is very well made. I ordered a size larger normally I am large but I like the shirt a little bigger so I ordered Xlg. It fit fine for me. when you dry this type of material it gets a little smaller. Cotton it is a little difficult to iron. The print is great.,B0002PZVK2
Looks great on and is just like the picture. My husband  loves it.,B0002PZVK2
The shirt was a gift. It arrived on time and was exactly as described. It fits great.,B0002PZVK2
"Following the seller's suggestion I got this shirt one size bigger then I actually need. We made all the measurements given in the chart on site. What I got - extremely big one. I am not sure it would shrink after wash and hot ironing to get fit.
Second thing - the color. It is absolutely different from what you see on the picture. It is bright yellow from top to bottom.
So, I returned it. Almost two weeks! No answer.
One think to add. The returning cost is almost half of the shirt price! Do you think I will buy anything from them? -:)",B0002PZVK2
Everything I expected fits well .. Looks Great,B0002PZVK2
"Beautiful shirt, the patterns match up...washed up good needed alike ironing...still looks good",B0002PZVK2
"Nicce design, fits great but needs ironing after a wash.",B0002PZVK2
"Colors are even more vibrant than shown in the picture, fit was good.",B0002PZVK2
"Great Christmas present, he loved it!",B0002PZVK2
"Very nice looking shirt, and fits perfect. I highly recommend it to friends and family members.",B0002PZVK2
Looks a little larger than expected.  However my husband felt it was a great fit.  Looks really good on him.  Nice quality,B0002PZVK2
"Colorful, nice clarity, casual but sharp looking. Great fit, flattering color.",B0002PZVK2
I like this shirt a lot but it seems that it is not made of very nice cloth. However this should probably be expected as it was only about 20 bucks.,B0002PZVK2
"I like this shirt, It's all It's cracked up to be plus made in Hawaii, USA. This has real quality all over it and talk about looks, well I got em, most of my friends and relatives spend almost every minute of their lives in  blue jeans and t'shirts. Use the imagination. They fit well unless your delusional. I rarely give 5 stars and fought hard not give it five, it probably should be I've never bought a better shirt and I just donated 6 white Business style long sleeved several different collar style shirts to vets action.",B0002PZVK2
Love the shirt. not in love with the fabric. kind of stiff cotton when washed.,B0002PZVK2
"This is a very nice, stylish Hawaiian shirt.  It fits well and is well made.  He gets lots of compliments on it.",B0002PZVK2
This is a very well made shirt - GREAT deal on the level of quality.  It actually has  interfacing in the placket and collar.  I haven't seen that in a long time! My husband can't wait to wear this when we go to Hawaii.,B0002PZVK2
"It is rather long on a shorter man, but works fine tucked or not.  Good deal for the price",B0002PZVK2
"My husband loved it. Looked nice on but was still a fun and original print.
The seller was great, made sure I had it in plenty of time for the event.",B0002PZVK2
"This shirt is a perfect fit in size XL - That being said, typically I wear a Large / Tall. So, still quite please I gamled on the XL as there were no LT listed! Great shirts!!!",B0002PZVK2
This shirt has vivid colors and a nice quality material feel. The fit was perfect and my husband looks great in it!,B0002PZVK2
Nice looking shirt and my son loves it!  It is a well made shirt and fun to wear.  I would buy again - thank you.,B0002PZVK2
I really like the look of this shirt.  I am anxious to see how it does after laundering.  Wrinkle factor?,B0002PZVK2
"the shirts are nice , but just around the belly it was a bit to snug all his clothes are that size with no problems...",B0002PZVK2
"Shirt is just what he wanted, he sometimes wears a medium and sometimes a large, this shirt runs a little big, he is keeping.",B0002PZVK2
"I was looking for some shirts for a cruise for my surfer husband.  The graphics on this shirt look just right.  I don't often buy clothes on amazon because I like to try things on and I am a ""toucher"".  This one did not pass the touch test.  The fabric is way too stiff.  Could be because I haven't washed it yet, but on future purchases I will be careful not to purchase anything that is 100% cotton.  The price was right, however, and the size was right on for a large.",B0002PZVK2
Had to send it back. Neither my wife nor I liked the shirt. It looked a lot better on the computer.,B0002PZVK2
"I wore this shirt too a concert right after I received it and got many compliments on the style, color combination and quality.",B0002PZVK2
This was a fathers day gift and my husband loved it!  Keeps him cool and keeps its shape well.  He gets lots of compliments on it.  It was worth the extra money and would buy this brand again.,B0002PZVK2
"It was would be nice to have larger sizes. I'm sure it will cost more to make it but our population as gain some weight unfortunately. I don't mean to be that guy but at least have a XXL size. I bought this for my grandpa for grandparents' day and it was one size too small. He isn't exactly a small man by any means. He really likes the shirt but it was too small. We are getting the problem solved but it is unfortunate that we have to spend more more money. I am trying to be polite so don't get me wrong. I'm not upset I'm just trying to help you guys out. Please, if you have any other questions, contact me via email at ups2014@hotmail.com
Thank you for your time.",B0002PZVK2
They're actually made in Hawaii. I ordered XXL for more room to move in it. Good choice. The shirt looks nice and and seems well put together. I bought another shirt from another brand and it wound up being kind of a lousy shirt. Time shall tell...,B0002PZVK2
"Some Hawaiian shirts are cut too large, some too small, but this one (just like the three bears in Goldilocks) fits just about right. Several comments out in public regarding how smashing the shirt looks. Easy wash, easy dry, and so far, no wrinkles. Would buy from this manufacturer again.",B0002PZVK2
Purchased for my husband to take on our Ventura vacation.  It fit him great -- he loved it -- wash it in  Woolite for darks so it doesn't fade.  EASY ironing -- received in 4 days from Hawaii!  Will wear it ALOT.,B0002PZVK2
The Hawaiian Exclusive Woody Shirt in Beige was what we wanted.  It fit great and the shirt quality is fabulous.,B0002PZVK2
"Just the thing for our Hawaiian shirt Friday's where I work.  Bright colors.
Perhaps a little snug at the waste, but maybe I've had one too many cheeseburgers!",B0002PZVK2
"This shirt is my favorite... it's a great shirt for home, office & even the golf course... lots of compliments.",B0002PZVK2
Great shirt.  Could not be happier.,B0002PZVK2
"I like the design of the shirt, and it fits as expected, but the material is a little too thick for a really hot summer day, and that's what a Hawaiian shirt is supposed to be all about, keeping you cool on those days. I still kept it, but I just can't wear it when it's really roasting out.",B0002PZVK2
This was a gift for a relative.  Sharp looking Aloha shirt. My relative wears it frequently.,B0002PZVK2
"Beautiful.  Fabric, pattern and colors far exceeded by expectations.",B0002PZVK2
"I really like the shirt. Washed it one time, and two of the buttons came off. I have several of their shirts, and this was the first one I have had an issue with. I sent an email to the seller, and they responded very quickly via email. I asked them to send me the buttons so the shirt would be wearable, and they said they would. I will update when I receive them.",B0002PZVK2
"Returned it.  Way to small.  Would have tried to replace with an extra large but they wanted a $3.50 fee.  I did not want to pay the additional
fee.  Still looking for a similar shirt.",B0002PZVK2
Got a lot of complements on this shirt. I love it!,B0002PZVK2
"This is a gift, and I am sure the person who gets it will love it.",B0002PZVK2
"I was looking for a fun shirt for my husband for his birthday.  He has 3 Uke's now and plays all the time while watching sports on tv.  I took a lot of time searching the internet for a shirt that would be whimsical/fun for him to wear.  When it arrived I was very disappointed.  The fabric was very stiff.  I washed it on delicate, cold water & it got black splotches on it.
Not only that, but it did not soften up with my Tide with Downy laundry detergent.  He will never wear it, but he won't throw it away because I got it for him.  A waste of money.",B0002PZVX4
"This aloha shirt is cool, light and never fails to get a comment. I have it in three colors. I bought my first in Hanalei, Kaua'i, and had to get the rest (which I ordered thru Amazon). It's held up well after multiple washings with no fading... and I haven't even lost a button!",B0002PZVX4
It's so hawaiian!  My husband smiled when he saw it!  Thank you!,B0002PZVX4
Can't wait to wear this at the next ukulele gig!,B0002PZVX4
We love these Hawaiian shirts! They are authentic and well made. Thanks!,B0002PZVX4
The shirt is a bit snug. Not good to a hot weather shirt. The fabric is also a bit stiff. Not very comfortable.,B0002PZVX4
"Gave this as a gift, and the recipient loved it! Very nice quality.",B0002PZVX4
"I love the shirt for the price, and as it seems to be one of very few available with a ukulele theme I had to have it.  The sizing seems to be more like normal shirt sizing and for a Hawaiian shirt I like them a little oversized.  Order one size up if this is the case for you.",B0002PZVX4
This is a nice shirt but the sizes run smaller than they are. My husband always wears a 2 xlt and this was probably a 1x. its kinda short for a big mans shirt. they really need to make these longer for the tummy area. I wish it was just a little bigger.,B0002PZVX4
"I bought a couple of XL's but they fit a little snug, and I am always a standard (not a fat guy!) XL.  Soooo, I ordered an XXL, which is a better fit.  The XL fits a little snug, but I'm afraid if I wash it (all cotton), it won't fit.",B0002PZVX4
Love this shirt! Listened to other reviews and ordered a size bigger than normal and it fits great in the somewhat loose way you'd want a Hawaiian shirt to fit. Gave as a gift to my fianc as we will be honeymooning in Hawaii and he loved it! Fabric is a little stiff but I think a few washes will help with that. Product arrived so much faster than expected. Overall very pleased with this purchase!,B0002PZVX4
everyone compliments him on it music lovers spot it right away. I want to buy the other colors now .,B0002PZVX4
I bought this as a father's day present for my dad. He loves it and it fit like we expected.,B0002PZVX4
"Its alright, but it shrinks after a few washings so it doesn't hurt to go a size larger.",B0002PZVX4
"My husband fell in love with it, it's different but not over the top ugly.  Perfect!
And great quality too.",B0002PZVX4
"The pattern is great and I get a lot of compliments on it.  It's all cotton, so I need to iron it every time it comes out of the dryer but other than that no complaints.  I found this shirt at a flea market in Oahu for only $13.",B0002PZVX4
"For a displaced ukulele-playing kama'aina living on the Mainland now since 1977,this shirt is perfect.  Everyone I work with knows that I play ukulele, and they all thought that this shirt was terrific, too.  Well-made -- of course it is; it was made in Hawai'i -- and sized properly, it is numbah one, or in Hawaiian, no ka oi.",B0002PZVX4
"The fabric is nice and the workmanship is good, but the cut is a little smaller than most Hawaiian type shirts. Hawaiian shirts are usually very full cut and fit loose, but this one is made more like a dress shirt.",B0002PZVX4
"The picture speaks for itself.  If subtlety is your bag, you probably would not be interested.  What I can say is the print is even more beautiful in person, the fit on a normal dimensioned person like me is great and it feels great. Mahalo.",B0002PZVX4
When I wear this shirt I feel like I'm on 24/7 vacation,B0002PZVX4
"Thank you for having this product on sale, my father loved it for Christmas.",B0002PZVX4
It has ukuleles on it!  Love wearing it.,B0002PZVX4
Everybody at Dollywood complemented on it!,B0002PZVX4
">Generally pleased with sizing, coloring, and cooler wear- ability of these shirts - Hang to dry to avoid shrinkage",B0002PZVX4
Wasn't sure when I placed the order on what the quality would be.....to my delight it was extremely well made and the colors were perfect! My brother-in-law wears this as often as possible!,B0002PZVX4
"I've bought several of these shirts from this company and have been very pleased w/ them: quality, fit, and colors!",B0002PZVX4
very good shirt the fit was just right,B0002PZVX4
"SEE ALL THE GREEN ON THIS CAMO-TANK TOP ??? I GOT ONE THAT WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WITH MORE BROWN THAN GREEN. THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE THE NEW STYLE, I GOT THE SAME ONE I BOUGHT 13 YEARS AGO TODAY !!!",B0002PZXMS
"I bought a tank and was having serious trouble deciding which top to wear while in the tank. At first I thought a linen button up would help me battle the heat in style. But then i thought ""I'm in a modern armored vehicle, who's gonna see my sleeves?"". So I went with this top. It's now my favorite article of clothing to wear while battling dismounted infantry.",B0002PZXMS
I bought this and several other tank-tops from Rothco and they were all junk.  They are about two sizes smaller  than the labeled size and they are so thin you can see right through them. I will never buy anything else from Rothco.,B0002PZXMS
Nice looking item! I like it so far. Came on time and fits well. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of style.,B0002PZXMS
I love this shirt and any other rothco apparel that I have bought. Rothco is great value for a great price. Wear your Rothco apparel with pride,B0002PZXMS
"The Tank Top's straps that go over your shorders are uneven (one side wider than the other), made in Chuna, seconds",B0002PZXMS
"This item is very thin. Light can easily be seen through it. I ordered a size to small and they were very nice about exchanging it. Of course, I had to pay postage to return it and then postage to get the new size. Almost not worth it. But BEWARE of the sizes. My first order was XL which was too small. My exchanged item was 2XL which was even smaller then the XL. Both had the right size numbers on the shirts, so what gives? I tried to match the other numbers on the 2XL tank top with Rothco site numbers and no such number. I guess I'll just donate this. It's now is too expense to exchange it and I'm STILL not sure I would even get a bigger size.",B0002PZXMS
Husband didn't like the feel of the heavy material,B0002PZXMS
It's great and makes my muscles look big!,B0002PZXMS
"Fits great and is cheap, perfect for the gym.",B0002PZXMS
"great shirt, but too small and way too short for a 3x guy",B0002PZXMS
"I'm fairly tall at 6'2"", thin, and muscular, and this thing fits like it was made for a pregnant woman. I ordered a medium and it flaps around my belly like a parachute. When I raise my arms, It will be halfway up to the top of my abs. I made the mistake of also ordering a large, hoping it would fit better. It is a tiny bit longer, but even more wide.

This shirt will fit you well if you are stocky, overweight, under 5'10"", extremely built, or pregnant.",B0002PZXMS
"runs a little small, usually wear 2x shirts and order up when i want them loose",B0002PZXMS
This shirt fits great and it looks great. The material is really soft.,B0002PZXMS
Great Product. Sizes Run smaller than I thought at least. If your an XL I would do one size up.  Great color great seller.  I will end up buying a new one mine didn't fit.  Regifted lol,B0002PZXMS
"Medium fit kinda small even tho i am a true medium, I suggest sizing up when purchasing this",B0002PZXMS
"Fits comfortable, wish they had bigger sizes in different camoflage colors",B0002PZXMS
Arrived on time and fits perfectly,B0002PZXMS
I really like this shirt very authentic military. This clothing is in style here in the south. The material is very good and I should be nie and cool in this south weather. All I need now is the pants to match. Wow what a fashion statement that should make! I definitely urge you to buy this product. The only thing I see wrong is that the solid background color in the shirt is lighter than the color in the desert pants I already have which is a more darker brown. Hopefully they have the matching pants to that shirt.,B0002PZYOA
"The desert camo pattern is what drew me to this shirt. It has that cheap itchy feel to it. It might go away after half a dozen washes, i don't know. I also feel the shirt might improve after some fading.",B0002PZYOA
"good quality, not the easiest pattern to find anymore.",B0002PZYOA
Looks good. A little bigger than expected,B0002PZYOA
Matches perfect fits as expected,B0002PZYOA
"If you liked Operation Desert Storm, you'll LOVE this shirt.",B0002PZYOA
I has a polyester feel and even though I ordered XL and it states XL on the tag it is a little more form fitting than I would like.,B0002PZYOA
"This is a great T-Shirt for folks who want a really soft, comfortable fabric against their skin.  A wear a lot of T-Shirt and this one is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  Also, it is fine in the washer and dryer but I didn't ""boil and bake"" it.  I like a really loose fit so I ordered the largest size offered.",B0002PZYOA
"All of the Rothco shirts I've tried fit way to tight through the midsection.  I'm 5'10"" and push 230, an XL isn't just a little, it's tremendously tight.  I think they are better suited for tall slender folks.",B0002PZYOA
"I love the way this shirt fits perfectly, and has a nice, bright color to it.  Also, it goes great with any pants/shorts that is about the same color.",B0002PZYOA
"This tee shirt is ""Chocolate Chip"" Camo not the  6 Color Desert Camo that the picture shows. This tee is not the ROTHCO brand, it was ""tee swing"" or ""swing tee"". It has green instead of brown as the base camo color. Green was not in what what i ordered.",B0002PZYOA
"Nothing too crazy to report on this shirt. It fits well, looks good, and matches some of my other 6-color desert camo gear.",B0002PZYOA
"That was given as a gift, person liked it",B0002PZYOA
Would be better if it had a pocket,B0002PZYOA
Colors are off like others mentioned. No white and not enough distinction between the browns and the tans. Size feels a little tight.,B0002PZYOA
Fabric is so-so but most of all the colors are not as pictured. There is no white and only three colors of tan.,B0002PZYOA
"Do you want to hide in a desert environment? Then this shirt is for you! Very comfortable cotton that isn't too tight and didn't shrink in the wash. My friends couldn't find me for 2 hours when we went hiking, because I blended in to the environment so well. Saddam's ghost s*** his pants after seeing this choco-chip delight coming his way!",B0002PZYOA
"i bought this item 11/2012 without reading the reviews and surprisingly after receiving and wearing/washing the item several times i'm thrilled. the quality of this shirt is a better feel than the other USN shirt i bought. hell i even sleep in it b/c of how comfortable it is. washes up great, no pills. when i bought this t, theres no image of a pocket and gladly i didn't receive a pocketed shirt (not sure why other reviews mention pocket) it appears that there's been some improvements since the older reviews. the price was excellent also.",B0002PZZDK
"The description clearly states the logo is embroidered. Not only is this untrue, but the silk screen is terrible. The shirt material is thin and unwearable. Companies like this should go out of business.",B0002PZZDK
"I purchased this item to provide as a gift to a friend.
When I received it, I noticed who thin the material was and really cheap.
If your looking for a quality tshirt, don't buy this one.",B0002PZZDK
The quality of the product was exremely inferior and if I knew that seal memorabilia was being made in China I would never have purchased it!!!!,B0002PZZDK
The logo was not center of pocket. The logo was on the shoulder at the seem.,B0002PZZDK
"Logo is silk screened and color is off. Instead of being gold colored or yellow, it has a greenish tint to it.
The description of the shirt states the logo is EMBROIDERED. IT IS NOT EMBROIDERED.  I contacted the seller and they REFUSED to return phone calls and emails. IN ADDITION TO THE FALSE DESCRIPTION, THE SHIRT IS CHEAPLY MADE.....STAY CLEAR",B0002PZZDK
I like this shirt a lot and receive compliments. Since blue is my favorite color that's a plus.  penny rex,B0002PZZDK
This T shirt is just what the doctor ordered ; US NAVY SEAL 1964 TO 2014,B0002PZZDK
Love it firend ask me wear can i get one,B0002PZZDK
"Fabric is kinda thin. Besides that, it's very comfy and just right for the price",B0002PZZDK
Very nice products I have not received the other items yet but I am sure they will be in great condition as the others!,B0002PZZDK
Cheap product that had a lousy printed logo....embroidered is what I got in the past for this product.,B0002PZZDK
"Nice T-shirt ! Soft, comfortable and correct to sizing. Fabric is slightly thick, but not so much that it is hot.",B0002PZZDK
Great Deal. Super comfortable and nice to support Navy.,B0002PZZDK
"Good quality, the size is as described and fits good",B0002PZZDK
"Stay away...cheap quality and OFF centered NSWC emblem!
No, I will not recommend to anyone.
This is a very bad batch bought from China (and the seller knows it).",B0002PZZDK
"the product is exceptionally the best of all
high quality",B0002PZZDK
Just what wannabees need to pretend they are a seal!!,B0002PZZDK
"Way too tight and I'm a skinny guy!  So tight as to be very uncomfortable, especially in calves and crotch.  Probably a way of skimping on material (made in China) to save a few cents.",B0002QVGBE
"The first time I wore these I knew it was exactly what I was looking for. They will keep you warm and will keep dry if you happen to work hard outdoors in cold weather. It's unfortunate that the there is a bad review with these due to whining nonsense. If you truly need to keep warm, do yourself a favor and give these a try! I will be purchasing another pair...No, I do not work for the company. I often read reviews to help make a purchasing decisions. A poor review on this item is truly unfair.",B0002QVGBE
"Please correct your website.  I am returning these without trying them on because they are made in China.  Amazon listed them as being ""U.S. made"".  This is the second thermal underwear I have purchased from Amazon that listed it as made in USA, but were made somewhere else.  This is frustrating as I am freezing while going to the post office to return these things a second time.",B0002QVGBE
Very warm and comfortable.  I am very satisfied.,B0002QVGBE
These are wonderful. I bought mens because I couldn't find them in women.  Kept warm in freezing temperatures in NYC. The pants I had over them weren't windproof so some wind cut through but these still kept me warm. Barely felt the cold.,B0002QVGBE
Got these for my brother who works outside in cold weather.  He loves them!,B0002QVGBE

these are very soft and do their job well.,B0002QVGBE
"Loved them, but do not wear indoors.",B0002QVGBE
My husband loves these!  They are excellent quality and as expected.,B0002QVGBE
I've had the top for several years and finally purchased the bottoms.  They work super well and are a great inexpensive addition to your cold weather gear.,B0002QVGBE
Just survived the coldest bears game ever wearing these bottoms ... wish I would have gotten the top and socks .... my legs were never cold and the pants were very comfortable,B0002QVGBE
Ridiculously warm.  Great for backcountry camping as pajamas!,B0002QVGBE
Very warm! ...I bought a pair for myself and my brother ...I highly recommend,B0002QVGBE
"not happy ordered bottoms,,,received tops.",B0002QVGBE
Roasty tosty and wicks away moisture.,B0002QVGBE
"I like the look and feel of the Polypro bottoms. I wore them around the house and they feel great against the skin (no scratching) but since I have yet to wear them outdoors, I can only give them 4 stars at this time. I will update my review once I have field tested them.",B0002QVGBE
hunters will love them...they do work!,B0002QVGBE
I work outside. These help keep more warm and making money. Great buy.,B0002QVGBE
These bottomsare nice in the warmth category. I can bearly get my foot (size 12) through and they are form fitting and give a little. For the last 20 years I have bought American made Polypro underwear with no problem in fit and wear.  I am a size large with thighs and buttocks. With these foreign made items such as these and indera you should order the next size up. That is why I bought only one pair.,B0002QVGBE
"For the price point, these polypro thermals are great. Even in wet environments you still stay warm. I get about 2 seasons usage using these. I've been using them since the 1990's.",B0002QVGBE
didnt like them they have a weird fit to them and are very scratchy material,B0002QVGBE
I had to return mine due to size issues.  WAY to small.  I'm a big guy and wear 2X all the time. This 2X was more like XL. Not sure if 3X would work ?,B0002QVGBE
it would be great help to provide measurement info as to the sizes.,B0002QVGBE
"It,s help me  on the mountain , keep me warm. Good",B0002QVGBE
Keeps legs warm. Great product.,B0002QVGBE
"nice material but very small cuffs, hard to get your feet through",B0002QVGBE
Very warm and keeps the biting winter winds from just cutting through your pants on those winter walks.,B0002QVGBE
"Kept me warm in the field, even though this season was not that cold. I have goods from the company UA and it kept me about as warm.",B0002QVGBE
Small fit. I wear a 30x32...32x32...the waist band is really tight ordered small..only complaint is waist band.would order again but a medium for sure.,B0002QVGBE
"I have ordered ECWCS gear before and this top fit great everywhere except for the sleeves, which were two inches shorter than they should be.",B0002QVGBE
"Returned item, size 2x looked like aregular mens medium",B0002QVGBE
These came in handy during the bitter  cold days of winter of not too long ago.,B0002QVGBE
best thermals i've ever had. The sizes run a little larger than regular thermals but you won't find a warmer pair.,B0002QVGBE
Works great. Almost to well. This is made more for your 20 and below winter. I live in louisiana and it doesn't get that cold. I was was chaffing. Now I just wear pajama bottoms for winter.,B0002QVGBE
"It runs a bit on the small size, but that's remedied by ordering one size larger.

They're incredibly warm. I use them for underlayment while I'm wading/fishing. They keep me toasty warm even when the water's in the 30's.",B0002QVGBE
"Great to wear on extremely cold days in Chicago. My husband wears these while hunting, snow blowing the driveway, or working outside.",B0002QVGBE
Really great!  Very warm.  Would have been five stars but the smell !!  Why does China do that???,B0002QVGBE
"Sent Back, too small, no liner of cotton",B0002QVGBE
Ride a motorcycle for a living.  I can definitely tell the difference in warmth when these are used under my wool socks!  Will purchase more very soon!,B0002QVGBE
Wonderful item!! Worth their weight in gold. My husband works outdoors in winter weather here in the Midwest where temps get below zero. He said when he wore these with temps in the teens that they were the only thing he's worn that keep his legs and ankles warm in boots. He was frostbitten before this purchase. True to size as well.,B0002QVGBE
These are just what I was looking for. Very warm.,B0002QVGBE
Item is very warm. The problem that I have with this item is that it tends to collect a lot of lint. It also tends to form a lot of fuzz balls on the material the more the item is washed. I do not believe that this is the original item that is given to our military.,B0002QVGBE
"My husband loves them and is very picky.  I bought one pair and when I finally got him to try them, he had me buy two more.  He loves to hunt and works outside often and they keep him very warm.",B0002QVGBE
"I use these when riding my motorcycle in cold weather.  These and a Carhart Artic Extreme coverall and my legs are toasty down into single digits Fahrenheit.  I don't wear them all day, too hot indoors.",B0002QVGBE
love it cannot give 5 star because it is always room for improvement,B0002QVGBE
These fit right and work great to knock the chill out when working in below freezing temps.,B0002QVGBE
"Fits as expected, works better than expected.",B0002QVGBE
"I work out in all kinds of extreme weather at various times during winter. This product worn under my water resistant outer-gear keep me toasty, but not bulky.",B0002QVGBE
"YOU NEED TO STAY WARM? THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER.
NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING COLD ENER AGAIN.
THANKS FOR THE GI PLUS POLYPRO PRODUCTS.",B0002QVGBE
Replaced my Carhart Bibbs.  Now I am able to work and move around without all the bulk while remaining warm and comfortable.  Excellent product for men who work outside.,B0002QVGBE
"if you ride a motorcycle all year around in the winter time this is the best, my kids  bought one forme  and I bought 1 for  my daughter n for the price it's great, keeps the cold air out n off ur body. S.I.N.Y.LADYRIDER",B0002QVGBE
"Very comfortable two wear, I've only been in temperatures down to the low 20's , I was warm and comfortable , medium size was perfect for me: I'm 5'6"" and I weigh about 168 lbs. Only ankles are very snug. Money well spent. in my opinion. Would recommend",B0002QVGBE
"Doesnt quite feel like what I was issued in the army, but they're still nice.",B0002QVGBE
was really warm all day long in the deer stand,B0002QVGBE
"We ordered one size larger, due to reading other reviews, but I think we could have gone with actual size instead. These fit and are roomy, comfortable, and most importantly, warm.",B0002QVGBE
"warm as can be, definitely not for temps above freezing.",B0002QVGBE
Warmest you'll ever wear. Don't bother with anything else. Wore these same exact ones when I was in the Airforce. Military issued for extreme Temps so you know they'll be good for you in the civilian world.,B0002QVGBE
"These underwear bottoms fit properly, are comfortable, well made, and are warm.  I would recommend this brand to anyone.",B0002QVGBE
"These are TERRIBLE!!! States same weight as GI thats not right and when will merchants learn to tell correct sizing to their customers!
Can't return for they were gift and friends wife said he throw them away as soon as I left! What a waste of money time and effort! I have used Amazon several times and this is the worst purchase. Have to leave a star rating! There should be a negative star rating!!!GET THE SIZING RIGHT AND SAY UP FRONT THEY ARE FROM CHINA !!!",B0002QVGBE
So far they have kept me warm during the cold nights that I worked I stand outside for long periods of time and they work good.,B0002QVGBE
"Was wearing two pairs of thick sweats working in the oil fields with wind and temperatures well lower than -10f. I thought I found the secret to keeping warm outside on the job but then tried these. One pair, 12 hours at -10  I have to say they beat out two pair of sweats. Wind can not get through!  40 mom all night on the Frac pad.!
Got to get a couple more pair!",B0002QVGBE
"I had to immediately post a review of the Gi bottoms. Quick summary so you understand the importance of these pants: I live in Alaska, and the place I specifically live in gets 80 mph and up wind surges, where sitting inside you hear the windows being smashed by wind and the windows are creaking and roaring. The wind is super fast and can blow you down the street. Also, the temperature is around -30 F and on below -50 F, which isn't bad. These occurrences are almost daily, especially in the winter time. So, hopefully you see what ""extreme weather"" these pants can take.

I went outside, the wind blowing the temperature well below 0 F, with a shirt (jacket, top outer wear, etc.), and super thin pajama bottoms. You know the type that you get for $5 at Walmart or something, that you feel if you pulled a little on them, they would tear? Well, that was basically what pajama pants I was wearing. Lets not exclude these bad boys on top. I walked outside, ears burning like a mother. I had to stand outside for a few minutes as I brought our weenie dogs outside to potty, so I was out for 10 or 15 minutes (the dogs were running over the snow and trying to not blow away). The whole time I was out there, I felt warm. The pants were amazing! I felt a soft little breeze, so little that it actually felt good. Honestly, I felt I was getting warmer as I stood out there, not colder!

I highly recommend these to anyone needing super extreme cold weather protection. I will try these out when I have to go hunt, I don't have any doubt these will not keep me warm.... maybe a little too warm though. Best 40 bucks I have ever spent. Got a pants and shirt for my Father for Christmas, so I will get his opinion when he wears 'em.

A down side- They are a little tight, but I would rather have these pants tight than baggy, as you most likely will put them under clothes, not over.

Positives- Warm and soft. Not itchy, so look somewhere else if you want itchy.
-There is a penis whole in the front, so if you are a guy, you have good thoughts for your buddy. If your a woman, you can sow it up if you don't like it, but I don't really notice it, even when facing into the wind.
-Covers all of legs and hips/torso. May go up to your belly button.

I wear XL womens clothes that hang baggy (don't like clingy clothes), and I bought a Medium in these, and they fit just fine.

If you have any questions, ring them by me, I will try to answer ASAP.",B0002QVGBE
"Very warm in extreme cold weather (below zero). I would purchase this product, again.",B0002QVGBE
Excellent for the price. Fit well. Comfortable. Warm. Recommended.,B0002QVGBE
"Keeps me snuggly warm, try um, you'll like um",B0002QVGBE
Purchase this product and stay warm! Winters A coming!..:-),B0002QVGBE
Keeps you warm when it is very cold out.,B0002QVGBE
"Nice fit XL 5'11'' waste 45"" leg 29"" twice as warm as cotton. Keeps the colorado mountain chill out. I am getting the gloves head and socks too!",B0002QVGBE
bought them to use on motorcycle and they do a terrific job keeping me warm,B0002QVGBE
Just like the ones I had in the army,B0002QVGBE
"High quality, great price, nice fit awesome thermal holds in the warmth.",B0002QVGBE
"I bought these to replace the ones I had that were to big. Fit is perfect, can't wait to use them.",B0002QVGBE
I work outside in the frozen tundra of Prudhoe bay alaska it works very well in that cold weather. I just wish I knew which color it is on the color scale,B0002QVGBE
I don't like the inner material. Scratchy after a while. Thicker than I expected. Probably warmer than I neede for what I was going to use them for.,B0002QVGBE
"Polypropylene underwear is the warmest, and most comfortable fabric to wear in the wintertime. Its only negative is that it is a dog hair magnet. If there is a dog hair anywhere within a few feet, it will magically attach itself to the fabric.

This is a well made product, but I would not have purchased it had I known it was made in China.  I have always bought American made Polypropylene underwear in the past.  From now on I will check to make sure that the clothes I buy are made in the USA.  When you buy ""Made in USA"", the job you save may be your own.",B0002QVGBE
These are the best thing going for cold weather. They will keep you warm and dry in the coldest of temps.,B0002QVGBE
"I've owned these before and wore them out. I don't want to be without them. Living in Minnesota, these are as important as jumper cables.",B0002QVGBE
"Never had an opportunity to wear it - just too small for me.  Ordered top and bottom in medium and I am small medium.  Feel, since it was made in China, the sizing is geared to Asian  men. Therefore, I cannot rate it for wear.",B0002QVGBE
He works as a security guard outdoors and winter here in Chicago has reached -40F to -50F with the windchill. He liked it SO much that I had to order him a second pair!,B0002QVGBE
Can't be worn as a undershirt becuase it's a lot bulkier then then he was expecting. But he believes it is keeping him warm when he is outside working and that is what counts.,B0002QVGBE
"These things are great!  I bought them thinking that they would be some thin type of material that I could wear under some pants as an underlayer for when I do outdoor snow activities.  These pants are actually somewhat thick, almost like sweatpants.  They are so warm and good paired with the matching shirt that they are all I use for under layers.  I wear my bib and jackets directly over the top of these and that's it.  I even get sweaty in 20 degree air if I'm moving around.  Can't recommend these enough.",B0002QVGBE
"We live in the Northeast part of the U.S. which means a short cycling season for those of us who love to ride.  Much of the time it is not foul weather or ice slicked roads that keeps us from rolling out but the cold. We have really good outer gear that we like but knew that the base layer would make the diffrence between heading out for the day or sitting inside.  The silk stuff we currently use works great but we wanted to push the envelope and see just how cold it could get and still be comfortable.  We also did not want to bother with the expense of heated gear so we decided to try this product.

We went out today, temps ranged between the mid 40's to low 50 degree range.  Instead of our heavy weight outer gear we wore our mid weight stuff (mesh jackets with liner in  a tee shirt and fleece pants) over this product.  That is it. The base layer preformed beautifully.  We were dry, comfortable and most importantly warm.  Today was supposed to be a short two hour trip but we ended up staying out all day. When we got home and peeled out of our clothes the tee were damp but the Poly was bone dry as was our skin.  Love it.

We are not finished yet.  We are waiting for temps in the 30 degree range and will try the product under our heavy gear. I am confident that it will work just fine. Stay tuned.",B0002QVGBE
For someone who works outside a lot and the weather has been freezing.  He says they keep him very warm.  Yeah!,B0002QVGBE
"I am 5/10, 130 lbs, and the small is too small.  I recommend ordering a size up.
It is a very warm garment, although there is not much give in it.",B0002QVGBE
"I purchased as a gift for my Son-N-Law and he said they are the best, keeps him warm on those cold nights and mornings while fishing....",B0002QVGBE
"I believe if they are bad at small things they will cut corners every place. The label on these sewed on sharp corners scratches, at a time when bad labels is completely no reason.",B0002QVGBE
For those that are constantly out in severe cold.  These are for you.  They are very warm and the wicking ability is great.  Used these for years now and they do what they are supposed to.  You will stay warm.,B0002QVGBE
"I love polypropylene. I wear these for a base layer while rafting. So ya I get wet. They dry so fast except for the waist band and the cuffs at the bottom. Nylon I think. Anyway, long after the pants are dry the waist and cuffs are still wet.",B0002QVGBE
The only problem I have is they don't quite come up to my hips.  If you're a big person forget it.,B0002QVGBE
"I bought these to stay warm and they are keeping me warm. I recommend them to anyone that doesn't like having cold legs in the winter. Plus, they're great to lounge around the house.",B0002QVGBE
"when i received these bottoms, I didn't expect much because polypro is plastic basically. I don't blame the seller for the quality. These pants do not flex with your movement and they were a bit snug on the legs. The one great thing about these is they make a great wind block. I bought these mainly for warmth but they are not flexible enough to move with your body. they kept puklling on my knees. They also make me sweat but its no different than wearing a plastic trash bag. The vender sent them very quickly and I was pleased at the quick response. i just did not like the quality and flexibility. I wish they made a really warm pair of these undergarments that was really warm and breathed.",B0002QVGBE
"These are the way warmer than thermals. If you have an average body type the sizing should be correct. Over drying them will make them shrink, follow the wash directions and order your size.",B0002QVGBE
my husband loves these he wears them over his silk longunderwear  we live in 20 degree weather all winter long and he is toasty!,B0002QVGBE
These bottoms are essential if you are looking to stay warm very good highly recommend because I work at an airport where the wind off the water can Getty very very cold but these pants are really warm,B0002QVGBE
this is a good product--very warm--used it this wknd on the farm (temps in 30's)---but it runs a little on small side-----order a size larger than you think you need,B0002QVGBE
these are great thermal layering for cold weather. I got a set tops and bottoms for the whole family. no complaints. wicks away and moisture from your body. we use them for snowmobiling,B0002QVGBE
"I've purchased two other pairs, including the first at a surplus store and buying them as gifts for my recently arrived friends now.  They are very comfortable and unlike the cotton kinds work against cold floors.  Mine are two layers of harwood floor with air leaks and even cold in the summer.  The liners are soft and stretch and seem to fit properly for the measurements.  Not being able to dry them takes longer, but I'm just getting an extra pair.  Inside, I wear them around when its not as cold as stretch pants.  I wish there was a female version but if its really a problem, the open are can be stiched shut.

Considering one pair of these makes up for more than the cost of the cotton type and works, they are also economical despite costing a little more.  I use the thermal socks as well, and it makes cold weather a lot more comfortable.  I reccomend them even if you don't have a long cold season.",B0002QVGBE
"my new winter underwear (tops,bottoms & balaclava allowed me to me the only brave soul who played golf at our club on 2/2/11 when 20-25 mph winds and 45 degree temps were the conditions of the day.",B0002QVGBE
The legs are a bit too long for me but very warm. I need the extra warmth because of working in a cool area and have poor circulation in one leg due to previous blood clots. This product really fits the bill. I am about to order another pair.,B0002QVGBE
"I bought the bottoms for my husband who is 6'2"" and they only went half way up his behind.  I bought a large which is his correct size but they just weren't long enough.  It's too bad because they were thick and looked really nice.  I wouldn't recommend these bottoms for a tall person.",B0002QVGBE
"Not polypro - tag says 100% polyester. Don't know how you shorten polyester to polypro. Would not have bought if I new it wasn't polypro. They are warm, but I use in wet applications.",B0002QVGBE
"I was specifically looking for a military grade, expedition weight, pair of fleece underwear and that is exactly what I received. But then, that is precisely why I specifically chose a product made b Rothco. Thus, I am very pleased with this product since it fits as expected and, it is the warmest pair of fleece underwear that I have ever worn.",B0002QVGBE
These are almost too warm if you do much activity.,B0002QVGBE
Very warm. Thought I was buying a fully polypropylene fabric. It's a mix of polypro and other synthetics. OK I guess.,B0002QVGBE
Baggy in the crouch. Too thick.,B0002QVGBE
"Item is high quality. Arrived earlier than advised. Perfect fit. Easy installation, less than ten minutes and getting faster. Would recommend this item to everyone.",B0002SA40Q
fast shipment product as advertised,B0002SA40Q
This is the second time I have purchased this product...  the first one was purchase in AZ at a local 4x4 supplier.  It lasted about 12 months and the tie downs came apart in the AZ sun.  Was not going to replace it with the same product but after looking around it is the correct size and design so I purchase another.  Hope it lasts 24 months...  Would be great if the straps exposed to the sun where made of something stronger or for the sun and heat in AZ,B0002SA40Q
works great provides shade and protects front passengers in rain.!!)),B0002SA40Q
"Good quality, easy install.  Wish it had a few more straps on the side to eliminate some more flapping in the wind.",B0002SA40Q
Awesome top for the $$$! A nice tight fit for our '95 Jeep Wrangler. No flapping......Love it!,B0002SA40Q
Great top. Went on easily and is staying in place. Doesn't work lose.,B0002SA40Q
Installed in less than 10 minutes into my exiting Bestop window track. Fits perfectly on my '92 YJ.,B0002SA40Q
Works great and is a life saver in the sun. Easy to install. I didn't have to buy the windshield adapter 95 Jeep Wrangler,B0002SA40Q
It's an amazing durable product that was extremely easy to install on my YJ!,B0002SA40Q
found manufacturing flaws in the fabric .life will most likely be greatly shortened. don't want to deal with returns on here thanks best top not,B0002SA40Q
This bikini is fantastic! The description said that I would need a wind channel for it to fit but I didn't need one because I had one from my soft top. It fit perfectly on my 1995 jeep wrangler. I would highly recommend it!,B0002SA40Q
This thing is a life saver in AL during the summer heat. The little bit of shade goes a long way. Plus it looks good too.,B0002SA40Q
"Fit on my jeep perfectly. I live in FL and going ""topless"" in the jeep here is hot as heck, this is just enough shade for me while keeping the doors off for a breeze. BF installed it for me without any fuss, went on easy. Very good product.",B0002SA40Q
The top was easy to put on the Jeep.  It appears to be well made--we have only had it on for a month.  So far so good!!,B0002SA40Q
"Thanks for a great, easy to install top!  My husband just purchased a his Jeep Wrangler that he has wanted for MANY, MANY years.  He installed it in a about 10 minutes and we tried it out all weekend.  LOVE IT!  Thanks!!",B0002SA40Q
"This top works as it is designed to.  I wish Bestop would come up with a better way to secure the top along the two back edges than the current straps.  They do the job but the way you have to attach them, causes the material to bunch up a bit.  But hey, for less than 60 bucks, buyers can't be too picky.  It does appropriately keep the sun off the driver and passenger and better yet, the Bestop Trail Cover still fits over the Jeep with the bikini top on, and that is a real positive.",B0002SA40Q
"Think I received a manufacture defect. The plastic is sewn way to close to the fabric making it impossible to put on. I read an earlier review of this. I have another on the way, if it's good I'll change my review. Had best top soft top before and it lasted forever. Hopefully this was a one time thing.",B0002SA40Q
"Bought this back in February.. I live in Idaho and the weather finally got warm enough to put this on... There is no way to attach the front of the Bikini top to the header channel.. The plastic end barely sticks out from where the plastic and cloth was sewn together..
But hey.. that's ok.. I'll just return it and for a new one.. WRONG... My return window closed 2 weeks ago...
So to everyone buying something that won't be used for a while.. Always check it before you store it..",B0002SA40Q
"Defective, but got my money back",B0002SA40Q
"Very easy to install but the left and right back straps feel awkward and don't tie straight if u get what I mean. I have tightened the side velcro straps twice but it keeps sagging after a day or two. Still, having no experience with soft tops i am quite pleased with it even if i am afraid to drive past 120km",B0002SA40Q
"like it a lot for how much I paid for it,is true flops and is noisy ,have to reroute the fastening web and eventually found the right combination,again reasonable priced i can live with the noise,the pleasure of driving without windows and roof is worth it.
1992 Jeep wrangler.",B0002SA40Q
Fitment is not as tight as I hoped for and you must drill a hole on either end of your windshield channels to insert a snap (not included) to snap the top to... I haven't had time to find and buy the correct snap so it remains loose..,B0002SA3Z2
best purchase yet. Love the way it fits and looks on my 82cj7,B0002SA3Z2
"My Jeep is not custom, so it not fit. My fault. Nice. Easy return.",B0002SA3Z2
Works great no problems went right on a perfect fit!,B0002SA3Z2
"Not pleased with the overall fit.  It's droopy no matter how tight I pull the straps and therefore flops in the wind.  The rear straps could've been better.  Our original 30 year old top had to be replaced because of a broken webbing strap, so we bought this one, and I was unpleasantly surprised by the clasps on the straps.  The original had clip buckles which made it easier to adjust and keep tight.  These cheap buckles don't grip the straps and they constantly loosen, not to mention the strap bunches up in the buckle so it makes it even more difficult to pull it tighter.  This cover also requires a curved channel (part 51209-01) whereas the  original did not, so in reality it isn't really designed for the original '85 CJ-7.  If I change the channel to the curved one I would have to change it back to put my soft cover on in the fall because that requires the original (un-curved) channel.  I also don't think the curved channel would fit anyway because there are snaps on the vehicle for the soft top that would get in the way.  Bottom line, I'm sorry I bought it.  I should've just had the broken strap repaired on my original.",B0002SA3Z2
"Was n0t happy with the way it fits. the wind flops the top so much that it hits me on top of my head and when stopped
, there is a wrinkle that shows.",B0002SA3Z2
"I was expecting more, but with everything I've read about Bestop their products have been less desirable as the years have gone by. It'll work for now, but I'll eventually find a better fitting one.",B0002SA3Z2
Worst product don't buy does not fit properly,B0002SA44C
Excellent top! After putting this on my 97 wrangler I've yet to put the original soft top back on. Perfect for chilly days and amazing during the spring and summer,B0002SA44C
The description doesn't match the item. I returned it because I thought it was sent by mistake but they sent me the same one. It didn't fit my jeep although it said it would.,B0002SA44C
Fits great in front!  Easy to install...The back could be a little longer to protect the back seat passengers. The top could also be a little wider across (use a little more material) in the back as well.  For $80 bucks it's a good value.,B0002SA44C
"Didn't meet standards, couldn't leave the hard doors on with the door seal and use the safari too as advertised.",B0002SA44C
would have been fine except grandson wanted full soft top,B0002SA44C
"Easy to install, great top for summer.",B0002SA44C
"I purchased this top to replace a bikini top that ended at the sound bar. This design performs much better. While you still get the open air feeling, it offers much more protection from unexpected showers and does a better job of dampening the wind.",B0002SA44C
"Need I say more. When its on its great, just getting it on is the hassle. I had to send back 2 tops before I was finally able to get one to fit.
I had the first one on last summer, when I took it off for the winter, it shrunk almost 2"". No matter what I did, it wouldn't stretch back to fit. Returned it. The second one was again about 2"" to narrow, returned it. The third, after much pulling, tagging and cursing, and after I left out it in the 90+ degree days, I finally got it to fit. I don't want to think what's going to happen when I take it off this winter, then try to put it on next spring.
Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy...",B0002SA44C
"Perfect fit for my 89 w sport bars.  Works great when a shower pops up, throw on upper half doors and roll. For the price, can't beat it.",B0002SA3YI
"looks cool with my half doors and new windjammer, is works well and keeps the sun off of you thanks",B0002SA3YI
fits like a glove. quality product. glad I made the purchase. beats the traditional bikini top hands down. A1 rating,B0002SA3YI
"not only did it fit like a glove, its sturdiness will see us through many, many seasons of use with its durability",B0002SA3YI
Perfect top. The price was fair. I have no complaints. And the box says I have to use 10 more words...,B0002SA3YI
It fits my 1990 perfectly. Was replacing another bestop bikini top thats about 6 years old. Hopefully I can get a solid 6 years out of this one too,B0002SA3YI
"Really happy with this top. Quick and easy to put on (and remove) and looks great when it's on. Good quality and a heavy feel to it, and the straps tighten down the top easily and well.",B0002SA3YI
"We have an '88 YJ and it fits perfectly. The top is sturdy, straps down tightly and in a light rain shower with just the bikini top I get a little mist but not drenched. We plan on adding the wind jammer that I purchased in the same brand. We don't have doors on the jeep at the moment. It looks as if the hardtop rounded doors we have will not fit but the original soft top doors will work. I am not the Jeep aficionado of the family but enjoy it, and I'm the shopper. This wasn't the cheapest find but I believe in most cases you get what you pay for!",B0002SA3YI
"i thought to myself, WOW!!WHAT A DEAL!! like 6 bucks for a bikini top!! ya, i know why now!! it's for looks only!! doesnt do anything that not having ANYTHING on wouldn't do, other than looks! the sun burns straight thru as does the rain! now, i'm guessing that it probably would work for mud, and wouldnt let it thru, but i doubt that too! i wouldnt recommend this to anyone who wants a FUNCTIONAL bikini top!! if you're just going for the looks, and don't care about anything else, this one is for you!! i would give it a lower ranking, but i don't want to have to deal with them calling me asking me 100 questions!! lol!! i'm supposing that is a pro, not a con, but just don't want the hassle. i figure what's 6 bones?? a lesson that cost me only 6 bones is well worth it!! MESH MEANS PENATERABLE!! now, if you're lost in the forest and need some sort of netting to catch fish, you can use this!! not for mosquito netting though, since the holes are too large!!",B0002SA3YI
Fits nice and snug.  I was surprised.,B0002SA3YI
Product fit as expected. Very easy to install and excellent quality. Would definitely buy again.,B0002SA3YI
Looks good.  Will see how it holds up,B0002SA3YI
I really love it!!! The quality is just perfect.,B0002SA3YI
Gift for our daughter. She loves it!!,B0002SA3YI
I absolutely with out a doubt love this top. Really easy to put on by myself. Finally got to go driving without getting burned. Over all its a great top.i would recommend to anyone with a jeep!,B0002SA3YI
Fit nicely on my stock 1991 yj...,B0002SA3YI
"Well made and constructed, just not designed very well. My old Smittybilt top that I replaced with this one was still tighter even without the use of the side roll bars.",B0002SA3YI
Excellent top!  goes on and off quickly and no straps over the back passengers.,B0002SA3YI
"I finally got my jeep back together enough to put this on. I really like the fit and style of not having long straps going to the back of the jeep. The only thing I didn't like about this top was that it collects and holds a lot of rain water. It could use a center support of some kind to help water run off. Other than that its pretty great. I like having an open jeep without being blinded by the sun while I am driving. Also I am not sure what kind of front channel I have, but I also have a smtty soft top and they both work with the same front channel.",B0002SA3YI
Fit perfectly and took about 10 minutes to install.,B0002SA3YI
Never can go wrong with the Bestop products. I have owned my jeep for 24 years and have used multiple products. Straps are secure do not break over time.,B0002SA3YI
Made almost exactly the same as the last one I bought for my YJ back in 1988. That's how long the first Bestop lasted. I expect this new one will outlive me.,B0002SA3YI
"Nice top with easy installation and a good, snug fit. Time will tell if the straps hold up.",B0002SA3YI
"cover is ok for blocking sun, but it flops up and down when driving, not enought holddown straps when it rains it holds water",B0002SA3YI
I am very happy with this item.,B0002SA3YI
"well its a top and the sewing was a little off on it but for something else made in china its not too bad. really wish it had not been outsourced... I honestly was expecting the top to be fabric but it was vinyl and a little tough to fit in the windshield. the top is pretty good quality, but I doubt I will buy this one again if I have to replace it. the quality of the actual top and the fact that it got here in two days and the fact that it was the correct top for my Jeep is exactly why I gave it 5 stars. the price is great but I think that's on amazon more or less.  there are four side straps two rear corner straps and one middle tensioning strap. the intention was to keep me mostly dry and some wind off me so this will work.",B0002SA3YI
Does what it should do fits good on my 89 wrangler. Looks great also.,B0002SA3YI
"very good buy, I recomended to every jeep owner.it will last a long time you won't be sorry about this .",B0002SA3YI
"Great product, good quality, and great price, easy to install. So glad I made this purchase for m daughters jeep",B0002SA3YI
This top was wxactly what my husband wanted. It provides a little shade to keep the seats cooler while sitting in the sun. It also blocks just enough wind going down the highway.,B0002SA3YI
easy install thank you great fit,B0002SA3YI
"Perfect fit on my 87 yj , fits tightly  looks awesome, made of great material well pleased best tops are well designed for great fit.",B0002SA3YI
"Worked for my 91, YJ.
Took some bit of work but, wanted to go with bestop.",B0002SA3YI
AS ADVERTISED AND FIT BEAUTIFULLY. TOTALLY SATISFIED.,B0002SA3YI
Really like the top! Very easy installation & great quality,B0002SA3YI
"A little apprehensive at first but when it arrived and I installed it in less than ten minutes.....the quality of a ""Bestop"" for aftermarket jeeps tops is far superior than any other competitor. I know this because I removed another name brand from my '91 and replaced it with this top. The initial apprehension.....price for ""Bestop"" is somewhat pricier than all others. I'll never question the price again and Amazon reduced the MRSP..win win.",B0002SA3YI
"Great for a cheap bikini top, but... here in Colorado with the sun beating down all summer, made the vinyl loosen and sag in less than a month. Doesn't fit tight anymore. And if it rains, there will be a giant puddle in the middle.",B0002SA3YI
"Nice product, however I chose not to use because it requires that I drill on my windshield frame. I'm going to try the kit that uses latches first.",B0002SA41U
Great product! Perfect fit for my 1993 Wrangler YJ,B0002SA410
"Came in on time, excellent product. I did need the bracket which I got a week later. Very happy with the product.",B0002SA410
"Fit and looked as expected from a Bestop product. If I can just get the weather to cooperate where I live, I will have it on everyday! Good quality material, design, and fit! for the price, you won't be disappointed!",B0002SA410
"Good quality, easy installation and perfect fit!! Thanks.",B0002SA410
Love it!! Every thing I was hoping it would be. Have had others in the past. This is a good one.,B0002SA410
"Easy to install and does everything I would have expected.  Used only for a week so far, so I can't comment on durability.",B0002SA410
Top went on great and had a great fit in the beginning. After a few days it broke in and became loose. Had to retighten it again but it does not stay snug. The rear flaps but it's to annoying. If I had to do it again I would purchase the same one. Quality is great and has been holding up so far with our crazy 60+ mph we got a few weeks ago.,B0002SA43S
"For the price it's a good top. Easy to put on and take off. I wish it was 12"" longer to totally cover the back seat. Not noisy. All and all a good top.",B0002SA43S
"Great top!  Great fit!  No complaints, by far my favorite warm weather top for my Wrangler.  Not much good in the winter though, it keeps water out going down the road but even with full doors it will get pretty wet inside in the rain.",B0002SA43S
Bestop products always fit well and this was no exception.  I only wish they would put some kind of batten in the top to bow it up when parked in order to keep gallons of water from settling in the top.  The quality and life of all the bestop products I've purchase has been very good.,B0002SA43S
what I wanted for my Jeep! It fit perfectly and was well-priced! A must have for Jeep owners for the summer months.,B0002SA43S
"I was told by two friends that this was a good and easy to install top and it is , Very happy with it.

Thanks Big-E",B0002SA43S
The top was easy to put on and it looks great. It doesn't flap all over the place like other tops I had prior.,B0002SA43S
I have a 97 wrangler and it fits great.  No flapping noise...Snug fit but no problem attaching.  It was tough to get middle strap between cage and sound bar but not impossible.  The instruction did state you may have to slide back the sound bar a little.  I highly recommend this Safari top and all Bestop products that I have encountered.,B0002SA43S
"Just a heads up,  I purchased this June 5th of 2016 and the top I received was NOT the safari (extended top) as shown in the pictures and in the title.
It was the standard bikini that covers only the driver and passenger area.
I'm not going to give it only one star for that reason,  I'm sure the quality of the top itself is good but the item description and picture is not accurate.",B0002SA43S
I am providing this item with one star because the two straps which are allegedly supposed to secure the rear section of this bikini top will not remain secure when driving over 35 miles an hour. If you should reach speeds of 45 - 55 the top violently shakes and comes loose from the Flow Restriction of air at these speeds,B0002SA43S
Bought this for our '88 Jeep because we have a modified roll cage and I was hoping it would extend long enough to cover it but it comes up short by 4 inches. I will have to take it to a seamstress to add the extra material needed.,B0002SA43S
"Easy install, doesn't flap in the wind like I thought it would at 80 mph on the highway.",B0002SA43S
"Good for the price. Had to make a few mods to make it work. Overall satisfied. If you have a newer jeep, spend the extra cash and get a better one.",B0002SA43S
I was very pleased with the top. It fit perfect and it had a lot of straps to secure it tightly. I will probably order this top again for the next replacement.,B0002SA43S
Excellent sturdy heavy duty material.,B0002SA43S
"I replace this top every three years as the sun rots the straps and after sewing them back on two or three times the top starts to tear. I've removed the back seat so I had to install some eye hooks where the rear straps normally wrap around the seatbelt attachment.

Good looking top and really easy to install.",B0002SA43S
"As advertised. Better than a bikini top because it gives your neck a break from the sun when the sun is over you or behind you. Also, provides shade for the doggies!",B0002SA43S
I like the way it looks and work. Only one problem  that I have is I wish the back attached  better with i,B0002SA43S
"Doesn't flap at highway speeds. Stays tight, fits excellent, even under snow!",B0002SA43S
I have the regular bikini top but needed something to keep the kids in the shade in the back seat.  Works great. Is a little noisier and flaps more in the back then a regular bikini top but gets the job done.,B0002SA43S
Everything fit great. Except when it rains or gets wet on top the water runs down on the back seat. If the top extended 3 more inches the water would hit the rear cargo area instead.,B0002SA43S
"Great top, well made and easy on and off. Keeps you dry and cool.",B0002SA43S
"Good quality, fit my 95 YJ fine.  I take away 1 star only because it is such a far cry from the OEM top, and I cannot really tighten it down well and know it will stretch...

The ramification of that is a tropical rain in Key West and I have a double mobile birdbath (the front and back fill up).

I need a solution to that but there is nothing wrong with this product and the Bestop quality control seems high.  With above caveats I can recommend this.",B0002SA43S
Easy install. Little to no flapping noise. Kiddos aren't getting sunburned.,B0002SA43S
"Fits great, easy to install. Only problem was they don't say where the back straps attach. I have pulled the back seat, seat belts and all. So had to modify how to attach the back straps. The top needs to attach to the back seat seatbelt mount on the roll bar. Other then this little bit of work, I was very happy with the probuct",B0002SA43S
Seems very well built and fits perfect,B0002SA43S
This is a great looking Bikini top. Put it on my 1994 Jeep Wrangler.,B0002SA43S
"The top is fine and well made. If it rains you are in trouble, the top sags and just collects water. To get the water off of the top, you and the inside of the Jeep will get soaking wet! I am speaking about when the Jeep is parked outside.",B0002SA43S
"It's ok. I thought it would at least cover most of the back seat but it doesn't, not much longer then a regular bikini top. Plus it could be wider to wrap around the side bars. Just seems small for the price.",B0002SA43S
"This thing doesn't really fit all that well on my stock 95 Wrangler.... It served it's purpose but could be made to be a little tighter so it doesn't flap around so much!  but overall, it did it's job and kept the hot sun off me and also the dew in the mornings...
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the fit and lack of adjustments...
it is simple to put on and it functions great on hot days",B0002SA43S
I was very satisfied with the top but maybe a Lil longer from the back but definitely worth it,B0002SA43S
Easy to install.  Looks great and have had many compliments on this top.  I'll definitely buy another one when the time comes.  Installed on a 95 YJ.,B0002SA43S
Tough material - but not tight fit and no straps to tie towards back. flapped too much - no longer use for Jeep top. Now use it to cover back seat of our car to protect from dogs,B0002SA43S
This strapless top is not really strapless. It still have straps but great to cover the the sun. The only thing I don't like they collect water when it rains even though they are stretched and installed correctly.,B0002SA43S
Perfect fit for my 1994 Wrangler.  Very easy to install.  Looks great!,B0002SA43S
"1995Wrangler Bestop Safari Jeep top.
When it is summer time in Florida the sun can bake you alive, enter the Bestop Safari top. This top covers the front and rear seats providing shade and cover from light rain. The top is made from a somewhat stretchy material so it fits sung when tight.  I have done a full video of the install on 1995 Wranger, look us up you will find other reviews there as well. You might want to make some kind of a bow system to prop it up when it rains, or you will have a small swimming pool over your head. I have a 1995 Wrangler YJ and it fits fine.
Pros:
The Price.
It looks good.
It is easy to install.
It keeps the sun off my head.
Good strong straps.
Cons:
It is flaps in the wind.
The Velcro keeps sinning around the roll bar.",B0002SA43S
"Fits very nice, seams to be good quality. It handles 70+ MPH with no problems",B0002SA43S
"Very nice fit with great material, you get what you pay for and this is the BEST TOP",B0002SA43S
Fit correctly and was fairly easy to install.  Durable.,B0002SA43S
"Great product, great fit. Bestop makes nice products.",B0002SA43S
Fits okay. Holds water above the cab and tends to get water everywhere. Holds up well at speeds exceeding 60mph.,B0002SA43S
WAS WONDERFUL!  IT FIT THE JEEP PERFECTLY AND AS WE HAD NEVER HAD A FULL TOP BEFORE WAS REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE THIS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE NEEDING A NEW TOP.  AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE AND RECIEVED IT VERY FAST.  LOVE SHOPPING AT AMAZON!!!,B0002SA442
"My husband bought this for our sons Jeep. They both love it. It keeps you covered and protected from the sun and rain. Yet, it allows you the feel of not having a top on the Jeep.",B0002SA442
This works great on my 92 Jeep Wrangler. I love the color. It's great for warm weather but might be raining and you don't want the top off completely.,B0002SA442
Like all Bestop products it's well made and easy to use. Easy on and easy off. Great alternative to having the roof full off for those days when the Texas sun is just crazy intense and we have those afternoon showers. Love it.,B0002SA442
great quality and arrived promptly,B0002SA442
"Good quality, pretty solid material",B0002SA442
Very nice material and well made. The only item to note is the 3rd velcro strap is right where the factory soundbar is so I don't use it.,B0002SA442
"I have purchased the full line of Bestop products (bikini, safari, full top, windjammer, duster, spare tire covers -- all in Almond and Spice colors) over the past two decades, and all were of great workmanship, materials, and quality. I recently purchased a Safari Bikini in the color spice for my '95 YJ, this after my originally purchased bikini was stolen. Immediately, I noticed the tag -- ""Made in China"". All their components used to be made in USA. The second issue I noticed were the cinch straps were of a looser and less quality poly material. Third, as I installed the bikini the Velcro straps to wrap around the rollbar were not stitched into the top in the correct place. It was sewn right in alignment with the sound bar on my Jeep. The original didn't have this flaw. Lastly, the center cinch straps were too short and the back corner straps were too long. All four of the cut-ends of the cinch straps frayed in the wind after only 30 miles of driving.

Ya know ... I'd pay an the extra $$$ to get an American made product with the quality of days of old from Bestop ... I sent the defective top back on my dime via UPS -- $18.00 for their junk. Thanks for nothing Bestop!

DB in Michigan",B0002SA442
"Perfect fit, nicely matching color.  Install is easy, took only a couple minutes. Doesn't flap when you get the straps tight.",B0002SA442
Love the way it covers most of the back seat area,B0002SA442
Bought for my 1995 Jeep Wrangler. Fit perfectly....very easy to put on and take off. Quality is excellentget what u pay for. Love the feeling of driving around semi topples.,B0002SA442
"My daughters and I really love it,l! It blocks the sun on those hot days,  but I wish it was a little longer, It doesn't quit cover the back seat passenger enough if you accidentally get coaght in the rain, but a very good fit all, and all.",B0002SA442
Much nicer then my last and not too expensive,B0002SA442
"I ordered a spice Roland received a black top.  The shipment info showed spice,  very disappointed.",B0002SA442
Works great on our jeep.  Has held up nicely!!,B0002SA442
"Same material as my soft top, looks sturdy and quality made. Had it on in 10 min, needs a soft top rail on the front to work though. My only regret is not picking this up years ago.",B0002SA442
"So far, so good...I like it. I think its a quality product at a great value.",B0002SA442
This shirt is nice! It is well made and comfortable. Order it a size larger than you would normally wear if you are going to dry it on the high setting.,B0002T8H2M
"A winter lining for these riding gloves seems like a great idea. I ordered my usual size, but the lined gloves are tight and very stiff. I haven't worm them yet because they are uncomfortable and I doubt that they'll be any warmer than the unlined gloves.",B0002T8YLG
"Definitely SMALL!  I have small hands and the pinky finger is not quite long enough.  I'm hoping they do stretch a little with use.  I am, though, a little nervous that they're too tight to keep my hands warm in the cold.  We'll see.  I like the gloves, they're just really small.  I ordered the ladies universal.  I'd definitely order ladies large next time - though I don't know if those run large or small.",B0002T8YLG
"Love, sleek, warm and functional.",B0002T8YLG
"Have worn this brand for many years, but am very disappointed in this pair of gloves.  The index finger in each glove is very tight. I ordered the same style and size as in the past. Have contacted manufacturer and am waiting to hear from them.",B0002T8YLG
"Order larger than you think you need! These gloves are TIGHT! But, very warm and have held up beautifully so far.",B0002T8YLG
"I have a pair of SSG gloves I love.  I thought this lined pair would be good for winter.  I could not, however, find anything to help me know the right size.  Turns out, the ladies universal 6/7 is very small.  I have small hands.  I can wear the gloves, but I cannot move or bend my fingers easily, which makes them rather useless.",B0002T8YLG
"These gloves ran very small.  They were way too small for my nine year old.  They suggested using the next Ladies size up, but those were too big.  I tried them on, and they fit me, but they were not very comfortable.  The seams inside are very bulky. Ended up just having to buy her an inexpensive pair of stretchy gloves with grip beads on them.",B0002T8YLG
You can never go wrong with any official liquid blue brand Band T. The gratefuldead line of T's are all heavy duty shirts with vibrant color and a solid screened image that's sure to last forever. I love any liquid blue brand shirt . This shirt and others are a must have to take you Further on your journey,B0002TNBS2
This shirt fits good for  a 2 xl and the colors and designs are amazing a must for a true deadhead,B0002TNBS2
my shirt. had this same one a few years back and it got stolen was so excited to get it back.,B0002TNBS2
"awesomely rad colors on this grateful dead shirt, held up after washing! i love it alot! great gift. enjoy  xoxo",B0002TNBS2
"Liquid blue, can't go wrong. Don't like this word minimum thing... 1  1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1",B0002TNBS2
"it was a great shirt, colors were vibrant and it fit really great. The detail on the shirt does not wash away after a dozen washes, this shirt really is the big thing, its a great shirt, I would buy again, which I did!",B0002TNBS2
"Although this shirt is an extra large, it barely fits my tall, thin son.  Had I ordered a XX large, it would have fit like a tent.  Nonetheless, he likes the shirt, and will take care to wash in cold water and air dry to hopefully minimize shrinkage.",B0002TNBS2
"GREAT shirt, well made, Jerry would have been proud to wear this item. Too bad you can
't buy wallabies for under $200.00",B0002TNBS2
This shirt fit great!! I'm an extra large and ordered an extra large and it fit great. The colors are great!! I wore this exact shirt when I was a kid. I forgot how good I looked in tiedye!!,B0002TNBS2
It's a Christmas gift. Haven't given to him yet.,B0002TNBS2
"It's a great looking shirt, but it was way way too small. Everyone in the reviews said it would likely run large, but it's a full size too small right out of the gate. I had to return it.",B0002TNBS2
It fits but very poor quality material..,B0002TNBS2
Grate Shirt! Always loved this logo. The dye job looks amazing on it. As usual most liquid blue tye dyes seem to run a little bit larger than a usual shirt. But no complaints.,B0002TNBS2
Love this design and Liquid Blue!,B0002TNBS2
"First the bad:  This XL is more like an XXL.  At 6'1"" and 190lbs this XL is way too big.
The good: Everything!  Thick cotton shirt, good quality screen print with bright, vivid colors.  This one's already a favorite.  In fact I'll be ordering more shirts come Xmas.",B0002TNBS2
"I love the artwork, and the quality of these shirts.",B0002TNBS2
"As awesome as this t-shirt looks on the seller page, it looks twice as amazing in person. The colors are vivid and the design is incredible, especially for the green thumb or grateful dead lovin' farmer in your life.",B0002TNBS2
"Looks great, guys good.  This isn't supposed to be a tight t shirt.  X large was perfect for me at 6' and 205#.  Note this is Sarah's husband, my wife is much smaller and prettier than I am.",B0002TNBS2
"Fits great, they should make a 3x!",B0002TNBS2
"This shirt is amazing. Bright colors and great design. The fit is great. I'm 6ft 3, about 200lbs with broad shoulders. I normally get larges, running the risk of them being slightly snug or short after washing. This shirt is perfectly long enough and not snug at all. It's not too lose either. This is an awesome shirt and I've had nothing but good experiences with tie dye from liquid blue.",B0002TNBS2
I LOVE this shirt..says it all! Have only been complemented...just beautiful and awesome...too!,B0002TNBS2
great Tshirt. Will order from them again,B0002TNBS2
"You get what you expect from Liquid Blue, plus! Very happy with their products!",B0002TNBS2

I was stoked when it showed up at my doorstep! I'm gonna wear it to their next show in Vegas,B0002TNBS2
"Bought this as a present for my dad, and he loved it. Great quality and fits exactly as expected.",B0002TNBS2
"Awesome shirt. Brilliant colors and heavy, durable cotton. Very pleased with this shirt.",B0002TNBS2
Awesome pattern on both front/back.,B0002TNBS2
Its everything i was dreaming of,B0002TNBS2
"Great t-shirt, fits well, color stays well.",B0002TNBS2
Item is exactly what I wanted and as described.  I would buy again from this vendor.,B0002TNBS2
too small.  returned for refund since they don't do exchange,B0002TNBS2
"cool shirt , great graphics....when i say it`s a little large, its in length only...",B0002TNBS2
The tie dye is very vibrant as picture shows.,B0002TNBS2
I love it! I got several complements the first time I wore it!,B0002TNBS2
"Deadhead since buying Workingman's Dead in Germany in 1969!  Saw them only once, San Antonio in 1971!",B0002TNBS2
"Fits as expected..I have many Liquid Blue shirts and they are all great. Great color, good quality. Have one that is almost 20yrs. old.",B0002TNBS2
"I love these shirts! Liquid blue is by far the most comfortable, best looking, long term wear shirt! A+++",B0002TNBS2
Awesome graphics! The one on the back is super sweet!,B0002TNBS2
Purchased as a gift. Has been worn many times since the purchase and the colors are still vibrant the applique is still intaked. We love liquid blue and have many of their shirts. Worth the money. Some of the shirts are 15 years old and still look great.,B0002TNBS2
Never been  dissapointed with liquid blue quality and fit. It's a long lasting. Great looking shirt.,B0002TNBS2
"""Liquid Blue"" brand shirts fit as expected, & there is no need to worry about shrinkage. I would recommend ordering your normal size & you should be pleased! They're great shirts for summer because they're lightweight material. I'll definitely stick with this brand! (~);}",B0002TNBS2
Great shirt but the size runs BIG.,B0002TNBS2
The dye is a more true to the sizing. Arrived promptly.,B0002TNBS2
Love this shirt! Was exactly what I expected,B0002TNBS2
"I'm 6'4, 226 lbs and in good shape.  I typically wear a XL mens t-shirt. I don't mind if it's a little form fitting; even like it that way, to some extent.  Ordered this shirt in an XL  and received what amounts to a circus tent.  Huge. Gigantic. Not an XL, not an XXL. Likely a XXXL, but tagged as XL. So very disappointed.",B0002TNBS2
Good value. Nice quality cotton. Who would have thought.,B0002TNBS2
If your a Greatful Dead fan you'll love this s***!!,B0002TNBS2
Little tighter than I like but nice shirts.,B0002TNBS2
"Great quality..... fits perfect..... Thank You
 Liquid Blue..... Aloha",B0002TNBS2
My shirt ran just a little big but would not return as it will shrink a little over time. Quality shirt and print.,B0002TNBS2
"Beautiful print, beautiful tie dye. Product came quickly. It's a Liquid Blue nothing else to say.",B0002TNBS2
This shirt is long. Fits as expected in the chest.,B0002TNBS2
"Great shirt, it might just be the hippie kind of style but the medium was closer to a large. It still looks good though and the prints and colors have held up well. Just make sure to turn it inside out when you wash and dry it.",B0002TNBS2
I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband and he loves it!  Great quality and beautiful.  Just what I would expect from Liquid Blue!,B0002TNBS2
"Shirt is nice, just very long! Too long to wear.",B0002TNBS2
"Great colors and the subject matter and lettering are vibrant enough to stand out against the tie dye.

One of the best tie dyed tees I think I've ever had!",B0002TNBS2
still an awesome shirt even though it was a bit too big but hey my mom shrinks all my clothes anyways and im pretty thin but very tall,B0002TNBS2
Shirt arrived on time and as described.  Thank you,B0002TNBS2
The XL was bigger than I expected. The shirt is great quality and the colors are beautiful. The art is perfect! Great price too!,B0002TNBS2
Love the graphics - especially as it arrived as our tomatoes & other veg has begun to be picked. Can't do without as a Dead fan Gardner!,B0002TNBS2
This is a beautiful shirt.  I bought it for my grandson and he LOVES the heck out of it.  He is 19.,B0002TNBS2
"Not a bad shirt overall just didn't fit as well as my ""steel your face-off"" shirt",B0002TNBS2
"Love it, a must have for any and all deadheads!",B0002TNBS2
Groovy shirt! The quality of the shirts are great. They hold their colors and graphics.  Would like to see some 3x and 4x shorts available. I'm an old school deadhead from the 70's. Keep on Truckin!,B0002TNBS2
Excellent print Jerry would be proud,B0002TNBS2
"Fantastic shirt. Great quality, vibrant colors. 4/5 only because it seems to run on the larger size. It is 100% cotton so maybe it will shrink a bit after it's washed.",B0002TNBS2
"Love Liquid Blue, anytime i need a new tye die i know where to get the best! They are always vibrant, well fitted, and made from high quality cotton. They are built to last ,I still have Some from high school.",B0002TNBS2
"graphics and tie die are fabulous, quality of fabric is good, size seems to vary as this is not the first t shirt I have bought from liquid blue, tried the womens medium and I am a small really and this was so tight that I dared not buy a womens again",B0002TNBS2
"I have purchased multiple Liquid Blue Grateful Dead shirts and they are all awesome.  For the price, you cannot get better quality.  The colors of bright and beautiful and they hold up well,  I have a couple that are well worn and still look great with very little to no fading.  I ordered this shirt for my husband for our anniversary and he loves it, my next purchase is a terrapin station t shirt and I cannot wait to wear it.",B0002TNBS2
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this shirt!  Bought it for my son for Christmas and everyone else in my family has now requested one.",B0002TNBS2
I love liquid blue shirts they lasts for years of wear and tear I have about 15 of them and they last for about 10 years.,B0002TNBS2
Very cool shirt. love the colors and the art work. Fits great thanks.,B0002TNBS2
Very cool shirt. Fits perfect. Very happy with purchase. Would highly reccomend,B0002TNBS2
Love it. brings me back to the old days!!!!,B0002TNBS2
"As expected liquid blue shirts are awesome.  They run a little big, but I like them that way.  The colors on this particular shirt are super vibrant.  I always get great comments when I wear them.  Again, great shirt.",B0002TNBS2
Just received it today-9/25/14!!  I love it!!  Awesome!!  A++++!!  Fantastic!!  Amazon is the best store ever to find music or anything that you are looking for!!  Amazon is #1!!  Amazon is like a Xmas Wonderland!!  I will be doing all of my shopping here!!  Great!! :o),B0002TNBS2
was somewhat small but colors were great,B0002TNBS2
"I have done business here before, and purchased similar shirts. Heavyweight, bright color, and fits perfect. Wash in cold water and hang dry, and this will last. My previous tee from this seller is very similar, and I got 4+ years out of it. I wore it ALOT. Good investment here.",B0002TNBS2
"Most awesome colors
Love turnip earth.  Great design
My grateful dead friend loved this ! Great gift for fan with a garden",B0002TNBS2
"I know I ordered the wrong size, I get that. However I have 8 grateful dead shirts, at least 5 or 6 of them are LiquidBlue. I know my size....  So when a medium is too short on me, and Large fits just right, I expect the next LiquidBlue grateful dead shirt to be the same large as before. This one was almost down to my knees, and I cant imagine what a medium must look like because that might be too big on me too. This large was really long.... Unless you are 7 foot, this shirt in a large probably won't fit you. However, good quality as always, nice vibrant colors, I would like Liquid Blue to get their sizes straight though.",B0002TNBS2
"Great shirt, good quality as always, very bright!
Turn on your Love Light! Nothing left to do but, smile, smile, smile!",B0002TNBS2
The vibrant coloring matches the karma of the band that day. Just pure joy! The back shows how you want to 'turn-ip' the volume.,B0002TNBS2
"I always loved this design and I was very happy with the tie dye, graphic and the quality of the shirt. The vendor got it too me a week faster than expected and i got to wear it to the Sunshine Daydream Premiere and that was an unexpected bonus. This shirt design is classic. If its not in your collection it should be. The back includes the Turnip world graphic. Just amazing.",B0002TNBS2
"Good fit, beautiful shirt. I've gotten lots of compliments",B0002TNBS2
"I bought this for my 14 yr old son for Christmas.  He is in love with it and wear it every week.  After 3 months of weekly washings, it still looks good as new! I thought the picture would come off with washing as its textured, but no issues so far!",B0002TNBS2
I have bought liquid blue Grateful Dead shirts for at least twenty years and still have at least 50 of them. Some faded from me wearing and washing because thats all I wear but they hold their color better than any other tiedye and where were you Amazon when I was paying 45.00 at local tiedye shops? This is a much better price. I ordered two and will be restocking the ones that have faded. The Let It Grow was one of my favs and it was autographed by all the Dead years ago. Thank you for this one that I will get Monday. Can't wait. And can't wait to get more.,B0002TNBS2
Very nice shirt. It washes up nice. The color is very pretty. Everyone says [nice shirt] when I wear it out.,B0002TNBS2
Great colors...fits well...could be a little heavier duty cotton/fabric.,B0002TNBS2
Great shirt! Bright colors looks just like online photo,B0002TNBS2
Fits As expected. Ships on time,B0002TNBS2
"Love the brilliant colors. The tee shirt has great weight to it, should look good for a long time.",B0002TNBS2
"gnarly shirt, got two others from LB, love these",B0002TNBS2
great shirt. love it. a little larger than most medium size shirts I get. but I'm sure it'll shrink down after I wash and dry it. no complaints here.,B0002TNDO4
"I bought this as a present for my husband. He is a true fan and attended concerts in NYC-way back when. He wears this shirt almost once a week, he loves it so much. Will need to be replaced eventually.",B0002TNDO4
"Great shirt, no shrinkage after washing. Love liquid Blue products!",B0002TNDO4
Was hoping the image was a little sharper but I guess its okay. Would love this shirt if quality was a little better,B0002TNDO4
Cool shirt with really good graphics. Fits good and is tag less,B0002TNDO4
Nice shirt but too long for the size XXL,B0002TNDO4
"Way too small for my dad, it's in chinese/asia sizes, so if you buy in 2XL or 3XL it's actually just XL or 2XL.  What a rip off!  The size chart is a lie.  The shirt is the wrong color and doesn't even dare look like the advertised photo.",B0002TNDO4
"Terrible product! Do not buy this! Was not as shown, the picture on the front was so small and the symbols where it on the back. It arrived way later than it was to be expected. It's also not even the right color. Terrible, terrible, terrible!  Honestly if I was Amazon I would not do business with this company anymore. It only gets one star because I couldn't give it zero stars.",B0002TNDO4
"Nice shirt, runs a wee bit large but still lovely.",B0002TNDO4
one of my favorite Nirvana shirts thought the Smiley face would be a little bit bigger but still a good shirt rip kurt,B0002TNEAW
"daughter wanted this for school clothes and when we got it, the quality is great, the image makes it appear like its larger than it really is, that is her only complaint.",B0002TNEAW
:) definitely worth it! Got it in two days and it was perfect!,B0002TNEAW
The shirt is high quality for the price. I've had it for nearly 4 years with only one slight tear. It's comfortable and breathable and doesn't hold odor. It's a shirt great for a teen since it will last for years. It doesn't shrink when machine washed or dried.,B0002TNEAW
Far too small and it wasn't from being washed and dried. I put it on when I received it it had to be two sizes too small. Unhappy consumer,B0002TNEAW
The shirt fit well but is very uncomfortable. The cotton is rough... Even after washing several times. My son will not wear it.,B0002TNEAW
Fit great. Arrived in a timely fashion. I'm 100% satisfied,B0002TNEAW
It was a little tight. But I'm huge nirvana fan so I'm happy.,B0002TNEAW
"solid old school, runs small just like back in the day.",B0002TNEAW
"This T-shirt is labeled ""Size M"" but actually fits like a size L.",B0002TNEAW
"Nirvana !! What more do you need to say ? Perfect fit, not a lot of shrinkage. I would purchase again for sure !",B0002TNEAW
"Love it very much, just a little bigger than expected but still very amazing.",B0002TNEAW
"I originally bought this for an outfit that I was wearing for the 90s a bar crawl. At first I thought I bought the wrong size. But I was wrong, it fit perfectly! And it is very comfy and soft.",B0002TNEAW
"My daughter was happy with this. Just a tshirt, not too bad quality. Really didn't shrink too much.",B0002TNEAW
"Bought this for my daughter, she really likes it except for the way the sleeves sit - they poke out. But other than that she loves it.",B0002TNEAW
Fits as expected and made well. My son LOVES it!,B0002TNEAW
I love this t shirt that I wear it almost everyday.,B0002TNEAW
Got this as a gift and the recipient loved it. It fit as expected.,B0002TNEAW
I love Nirvana and I love showing that I do with this T-Shirt. It fits alright and it's comfortable. Also the printing seems durable.,B0002TNEAW
Fits great and is the replica of the original shirt Nirvana used to sell early on in the beginning.  It has words on the back but any true fan would love this version.,B0002TNEAW
"Great band, great shirt. Snoogans.",B0002TNEAW
"The word ""whores"" is printed on the back. Not appropriate for my 12 year old. Did not see this advertised. I just took a sharpie to black it out.",B0002TNEAW
"it was a bit bigger than i expected when i received it but since heavy cotton it shrinked too my prefered size i like it alot also it has a quote in the back, thank you!",B0002TNEAW
It fit somewhat large but I love it,B0002TNEAW
Fits perfectly. Timely arrival.,B0002TNEAW
"It's a great shirt. great fit, and the design's great.",B0002TNEAW
Shirt came in a size too small than requested,B0002TNEAW
"Of course I love the design, and yes I know there's the word ""whore"" on the back. I looked specifically for this style so I knew I would like the design. T shirt fit as expected. 2 reasons I gave I dropped it down from a 5 star. 1st and main reason is that with the headline description ""soft t shirt"", it's a bit misleading. I understand ""soft"" is a relative word, but generally these days I don't think this type would be considered soft. Soft in my opinion is a t shirt from H&M, Affliction, Urban Outfitters, designer t shirts.. etc.., where the thickness is usually thinner. That being said, the cotton is of a heavier quality and can be a little rough, depending on skin sensitivity. The brand was Gildan, maybe somewhat similar to Anvil, those generic brand t shirts (though I think Hanes or Fruit of aloom would be softer). Just take off the word ""soft"" from the description and it would be less misleading, because the ""soft"" is why I chose to get this one.
2nd is that the front print of the Nirvana and smiley face is slightly off centered and leans more toward the left.",B0002TNEAW
perfect for any Nirvana Fan. it fit perfectly and came the exact day estimated. great purchase. Much wow. yum yum,B0002TNEAW
"Great band! I bought the small size for a 5'4""-ish person and it was slightly too long and wide but that is easy to remediate.  No complaints, just a normal shirt that has been screenprinted.  I'm not overly impressed with the fabric quality but it's what I expected.",B0002TNEAW
"If you ever need anything please don't
hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive.
I've seen it all, I was here first.

This is a great shirt, and one of the only one I could find in XXL",B0002TNEAW
"True to size, comfy shirt. Love the print! The back and front print are great. Defiantly going to get another for friends.",B0002TNEAW
I did not know of the words printed on the back. My son cannot wear it to school which is what I bought it for.,B0002TNEAW
It is great a little big but that's ok..make sure you know it says whores on the back i bought it and my mom wouldnt let me wear it,B0002TNEAW
Great shirt to tout my love of the band. I'm a girl and the men's large fits like a comfy boyfriend's tee. I wear it all the time ;-) Very happy with my purchase!,B0002TNEAW
"Great shirt. Will cherish it forever. Fit as expected but wasn't the soft material I had predicted itd be. Nonetheless, it looks good and I've had no problems with washing it or anything.",B0002TNEAW
"I love this shirt! It arrived quickly and as described, I love the design. It's of great quality (very thick and comfortable) and I constantly wear it! I recommend this product!",B0002TNEAW
"If you can wear a medium from a department store, then this XL shirt is ok. If you need XL or above (even large) no shirt from here will fit you.",B0002TNEAW
I'm a female but I bought this shirt for myself anyway. I'm a pretty big boned girl so I got it in a L but it was TOO big so I had to cut the sleeves and shorten the length og the shirt. It doesn't get small and I've washed this shirt A LOT and the color is the same as I firt got it. Other than that this is seriously my favorite shirt!,B0002TNEAW
This is an iconic shirt that my brother always wanted being a big fan of nirvana. the shirt is high quality the print is clear as day. simple but exactly what he wanted. he loves it great shirt for under $20 oh yeah!!,B0002TNEAW
This shirt is perfect for the Nirvana lover - even those with broad shoulders!  The size is true and the colors are bright.  It ships fast too!,B0002TNEAW
"Received quickly, good quality.",B0002TNEAW
did not see the bad words on the other side. cant wear to school,B0002TNEAW
"Man people give bad reviews for the stupidest things, a nirvana shirt at a decent price 5 stars all day. Wash and dry on delicate to reduce shrinking!",B0002TNEAW
Runs very small. I had intentions of cutting and distressing it anyways so it now fits but order up!,B0002TNEAW
Cute. Get your normal shirt size. Fabric is a bit cheap,B0002TNEAW
Received it with no problems fits good,B0002TNEAW
The fit on this shirt is so awkward. I've never seen anything like it. It's as if the body of it is a small but the sleeves of it are large.,B0002TNEAW
"This T-shirt is the artwork of my fave Metallica album, and the quality is great! The back electrocuted guy got'em glow in the dark bones, awesome!
Happy birthday to me!",B0002TNE1G
i got this shirt for my hubby and he loves it. at the store it would have been about $20+ but the price here is awesome,B0002TNE1G
Very satisfied with purchase. I wanted very much to have this design on a T-Shirt.,B0002TNE1G
"The t shirt arrive fairly quickly. It's too brand new and I need to put a few washes in since Ride the Lightnin is an old album. I have Ride the Lightning guitar straps. This album is definately amongst my top 5 metallica albums. i wish the logo on the back were smaller though. or the logo be on top left of chest on front and the huge album cover be on the back. that would be really cool. if you think this is a good idea and want me to do layout for your t shirts, let me know...",B0002TNE1G
"The product is good, but I think is a litte expensive according to its quality",B0002TNE1G
I had a classic Ride the Lightning concert T-shirt back in the 1980's. My little brother borrowed it and I never saw it again. So cool to find one at Amazon.,B0002TNE1G
I love Metallica and this shirt was great for the price and I wear it often as I can,B0002TNE1G
Perfect fit and and the images are vivid and exactly as advertised.,B0002TNE1G
"I bought this shirt to replace my old Ride the Lightning shirt from high school which no longer fits. I really like the quality of this shirt as well as the quality of the print. It also has the picture of the guy getting fried in the electric chair on the back which is something my old shirt didn't have. It is a great buy, especially for the price if you don't want to spend premium money on ""official"" band merchandise.",B0002TNE1G
Perfect in every way!!!! And the quality is excellent!!! Would definitely recommend this to everyone!!!,B0002TNE1G
Great shirt. Bought this for an 89s school party. Gave 4 stars because we couldn't wear to school due to the back of the shirt. When purchased there wasn't a picture view available for the back. Still a great shirt,B0002TNE1G
Did shrink a bit but not too much after a few washes but love the shirt!,B0002TNE1G
True Metallica fans can never go wrong this this shirt!,B0002TNE1G
Nice printing. Good quality. Very vibrant & defined colors. This one is better than the original. Good quality t-shirt as well.,B0002TNE1G
Good graphic and material. It fit well. The design is front and back. Good stuff.,B0002TNE1G
Good quality and the sizing is accurate,B0002TNE1G
"Good quality shirt, material is comfortable and size was what I expected. Logos and screen printing looks good. This shirt did not let me down after purchasing",B0002TNE1G
Normal fit. I always have issue with tshirt. Sometimes Large are too small or xl are too big. I order this large expecting a bit of a tight fit but no problems. I love it. Had many complements on this shirt.,B0002TNE1G
"Good quality shirt, the back does glow in the dark but sadly the print soon cracked at least with mine and I did not even wash it.",B0002TNE1G
"Horrible quality. They said the picture is supposed to look distressed, but it really just looks like a real bad print job.dont waste your money",B0002TNE1G
Good fit so far no shrinking and hasn't faded away,B0002TNE1G
"one of my favorite shirts, the graphics look awesome. Definitely buy if you're looking for a Ride the Lightning shirt",B0002TNE1G
Shrinks when washed and dried. Order up at least 1 size,B0002TNE1G
"Awesome tee for the $$$, fits great.",B0002TNE1G
Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loved it!,B0002TNE1G
Nice shirt. Fits well. Less than half the price of the same shirt for sale at the concert.,B0002TNE1G
Beautiful shirt the feel is amazing for such a cheap price 10/10 would buy again!,B0002TNE1G
Great product! 100% recommended!,B0002TNE1G
"I got this shirt for my boyfriend and he loves it, good quality and fits perfect",B0002TNE1G
The reviews gave my son mix signals but turns out it fitted him pretty good and the print on the shirt was amazing,B0002TNE1G
"Good quality T-Shirt not the thin cheep material you sometime get.  Graphics were clean and it looks like the original T from the 80s.  Haven't washed it yet, so there is still a chance for let down but so far so good.",B0002TNE1G
"The print looks fine, but it's the scratchiest shirt I've ever felt. Had to just cut it up and turn it into patches for my vest.",B0002TNE1G
"Exactly what my son was hoping for, happy with product. I often have to get X-Large just to fit his shoulders and chest, then he may have a shirt that is a bit to long. I went with the Large by chance and it fits perfect. Have not washed in yet, will wash in cold when I do just to be on the safe side.",B0002TNE1G
"Perfect size, ever since ive bought it, ive been wearing it till now. And the cool thing about this shirt is the few skull parts at the back is glow in the dark.",B0002TNE1G
"Great shirt, was a little tight around the neck but other than that I was more than satisfied.",B0002TNE1G
"Does not run true to size (runs small)
After washing in cold shrunk more.
Do not waste your money on this shirt.",B0002TNE1G
"even tho i discovered the nasty ugly girl across the street has the same shirt and thus i can never wear it out, i loved this purchase",B0002TNE1G
This shirt took me back to 1985 again.,B0002TNE1G
Nothing positively or negatively surprising. Solid purchase,B0002TNE1G
"I got this shirt and then had to start carrying a stick to keep all the ladies back. They think it's super cool and I can't blame them what's more American than Metallica? I was sitting there sporting my shirt next thing I know I had an ice cold budweiser in my right hand, an American flag in my left and then a bald eagle landed on my shoulder....Murica",B0002TNE1G
Pretty cool but expect it to shrink a lot after the first wash.,B0002TNE1G
"The shirt is soft and good quality material. The print is thick and vibrant. I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and he lives in it: he loves it so much that he wears it everywhere. I have bought a lot of tshirts for him from amazon, but this one is his favorite.",B0002TNE1G
"Grandsons all loved this shirt...no complaints here, it was a hit! Fits great, easy care.",B0002TNE1G
Great shirt. Just what I ordered!!,B0002TNE1G
Fits as expected. Soft and comfy.,B0002TNE1G
Great shirt and fit as expected.,B0002TNE1G
"nice shirt, fits well, is as advertised",B0002TNE1G
Perfect fit true to size tee! I love AAA blank tees,B0002TNE1G
"Fit well, good quality fabric and graphics.",B0002TNE1G
Bought this for my boyfriend & he loved it. Great buy!,B0002TNE1G
Fits well. Colors are really bright,B0002TNE1G
Shirt was way too small it was not a large at all especiallt after washing it!,B0002TNE1G
Not even made of cotton. Some nylon-ish material. Barely can see the logo. Doesnt even have a tag! So horrible...,B0002TNE1G
"Terrible terrible shirt. After waiting 5-6 weeks to get this shirt, my son is extremely disappointed. Apparently not everyone is receiving the same T-shirt or these positive reviews are false garbage. Some photos of other reviewers show a very nice shirt made of cotton with straight and clean logos with high resolution. That is NOT what I received. For starters, the shirt is NOT 100% cotton. This is spandex-like material, but since there is no label on the shirt either, I can't tell you exactly what is made of. Second, the logos are a mess. The front logo is crooked and the corners of the iron-on patch are visible in the upper right of the logo and bottom left of logo (see attached pic). The back logo is crooked also and is massively big making the resolution terrible and looks blurry in person. All in all just a horrible shirt and I want my money back.",B0002TNE1G
"Great print and decent quality t shirt. No complaints, it is a Ride the Lightning t-shirt!!",B0002TNE1G
A little more blue and purple in the middle but very nice shirt,B0002TNE1G
This is a terrible design.  The image is much smaller and blurry on the shirt.  You get a cheap design for a cheap price.  Bad quality.,B0002TNE1G
"Great price for this product. Size medium fit my partner well. We both agreed that the Metallica line on the shirt seemed a little less pronounced than shown in the image, but it kind of gives it that rustic, retro look. Great gift overall.",B0002TNE1G
"piece of s*** shirt. Ordered an XL because i like my shirts bigger, and it fit more like a medium or small. The graphic is much darker than the image,  and looks nothing like described. Happy i used my amazon points intsead of my own money for the horrible shirt. would give a negative 1 if i could.",B0002TNE1G
"Fits perfect, good quality and it's the album that opened my eyes to metal!",B0002TNE1G
Like it but way too small for my son.,B0002TNE1G
Very small logo on front and no logo in the back I would love to share pictures but not able too for some reason I want my money back,B0002TNE1G
Took over a month to receive it and was a bootleg version of the t shirt,B0002TNE1G
"After waiting a month to receive this shirt I was very disappointed. The graphic on the front was very small and did not have the appearance of actual merchandise. I purchased this shirt because it actually had the back graphic, but when I received it there was no graphic on the back. I was very disappointed with this purchase and I would not recommend buying this shirt.",B0002TNE1G
This shirt shrunk from a xxl to a small in a single wash. Very poor quality. I now have a Metallica dust rag.,B0002TNE1G
Graphic and design looks great. Fits as I expected it and is comfortable.,B0002TNE1G
smaller than expected. It doesn't feel like authentic merchandise. seems very Chinese made and smelled weird until washed. Kind of thin and small for me.,B0002TNE1G
It's a bit larger than expected.,B0002TNE1G
Double sided as graphic on the back,B0002TNE1G
The size wasn't the problem. Tbe print on the shirt was the problem. It was all faded out like it was old or just didn't get printed right.,B0002TNE1G
Love this shirt. Well worth the money. Only problem I have with it is the small fine print on the front but I can look over that.,B0002TNE1G
It is a shirt that says Metallica on it. Whats not to love?,B0002TNE1G
quality material and the design is placed perfectly on the shirt. - fit  as expected,B0002TNE1G
Nice looking shirt for the price. Would prefer thicker material.,B0002TNE1G
Great shirt!!! I've washed it a few times and the graphic hasn't been damaged at all. Make sure to dry on low or hang it to dry,B0002TNE1G
Everything is legit.  The color slays,B0002TNE1G
"Awesome shirt fits very good, plus I had no idea the back design glows in the dark. All in all awesome shirt!",B0002TNE1G
Dope . Fits large but I like it,B0002TNE1G
One of the best t-shirts I ever purchased! The design is slick and the skeleton on the back glows in the dark! Highly recommended for Metallica fans.,B0002TNE1G
"Front image is terribly off-centered and the rear image is no where near as large as it appears in the photo. If you look at other t shirts from Bravado, it's the same model but just with different graphics. Still, a neat copy of the original t shirt. However, very disappointed with the front image being so off-centered.",B0002TNE1G
Fits perfectly and looks great.,B0002TNE1G
I bought this for my brother and he loves it. Came just as described and fits him perfectly.,B0002TNE1G
Awesome shirt! Wash inside-out to prevent fading.,B0002TNE1G
"Bought for boyfriend, loved it and got it for a great price",B0002TNE1G
This shirt is pretty awesome.  Except for the company copyright printed in white letters at the bottom.  That's stupid.  I had to black that out with ink.  No one wants to see that.  It fits well and looks great.,B0002TNE1G
The glow in the dark design took me by surprise lmao,B0002TNE1G
"Classic ride the lightning logo, also has logo on back side of a skeleton getting fried in the chair. This is the 5th or 6th of this shirt ive bought. All shirts wear out and its been 30 years now.",B0002TNE1G
What a great shirt.  It fits  and wears well; washes with no fade. I also should mention that the back glows in the dark. Cool!,B0002TNE1G
"fit great, this was a great deal",B0002TNE1G
Fits great and the material is awesome. Couldn't have had a better overall purchase.,B0002TNE1G
"bought as a present for husband, he loved it",B0002TNE1G
"my son loved the shirt , good quality,great fit",B0002TNE1G
"If you like this shirt, you should just buy it. Life's for your own to live your own way.",B0002TNE1G
Fits great.  Bright colors.  Excellent value here.  Love this retro Metallica shirt.,B0002TNE1G
"Love the shirt man.  I had this shirt along time ago, I don't know what happend to it, but Im happy I found this one. The colors and print are just perfect. The fit is great too. Will be purchasing again.",B0002TNE1G
"It came in early and fit well, and the quality on the images were high quality and not showing any sighs of fading. I would recommend this to anyone who knows someone who loves or even likes Metallica, they would love it as a gift",B0002TNE1G
"Great price, great quality...it's just like getting it at a show ;)",B0002TNE1G
super badass. could not be any more badass.,B0002TNE1G
I love this shirt! Seems to be of good quality and logos look awesome front and back. Sweet shirt for the best band in the world.,B0002TNE1G
The quality is very professional and the graphics are actually more detailed than the album cover is! This was an awesome buy and I look forward to rockin' this out Everywhere!,B0002TNE1G
"Great buy! Love it, most of my wardrobe is band shirts and this is great quality it washes great.",B0002TNE1G
Love this shirt. Fit as expected.,B0002TNE1G
This shirt is extremely well made and extremely well priced. The quality is absolutely superb and captures Metallica's second album perfectly.  If you're a fan of Metallica this is a must buy and great to have.,B0002TNE1G
It's Metallica Ride the Lightning... What more do I need to say. Awesome shirt.,B0002TNE1G
It fits well. Be careful about washing it a lot. The paint will start to wear and the shirt takes on a navy-purple color. It doesn't bother me too much.,B0002TNE1G
"It's a good quality shirt! The material doesn't feel cheap and the colors are very vibrant/bold. It fits somewhat small, but it's still good.

RIDEEEE THE LIGHTENING!!",B0002TNE1G
Somewhat small for my taste but I still wear it with pride \m/,B0002TNE1G
Great shirt fits perfectly. ...,B0002TNE1G
best metal band / best era of metal / one of the best sellers \m/,B0002TNE1G
"Got a belly, get an extra large or this fits right, thin shirt though.",B0002TNE1G
Fits average and good print quality. The t-shirt material is a good quality also. Cant wait to break it in.,B0002TNE1G
This is the best for any Metallica lover!!!!!!,B0002TNE1G
recommend to any one who likes metallica,B0002TNE1G
Didn't like the shirt.  Expected it to be a better quality.  It was basically a Hanes TShirt.  As well it fit tight.  Not high quality cotton,B0002TNE1G
"Great tee, good price and quality. Arrived fast and packed well.",B0002TNE1G
"Metallica is one of my favorite bands, loved the shirt it fit perfectly .",B0002TNE1G
Ordered a ex large got a medium,B0002TNE1G
Fits great my son loves this shirt he wants more. We will be getting more.sized just how we were hoping.,B0002TNE1G
good stuff looks great. wonderful design.,B0002TNE1G
Awesome. it fits perfectly and everyone loves it.,B0002TNE1G
Do not but very cheaply made and small go xl large and we're still small.  Garbage,B0002TNE1G
"Vivid coloring.  Very dark black.  Perfect for that Metallica fan in your family, circle of friends, AA meeting, or local mental hospital.  It fits well and looks great.  The back of the shirt has a graphic of a zombie-like guy being electrocuted in an electric chair.  So, yes, it is a perfect choice for church.

Ride the lightning and buy this shirt.  You won't regret this ONE.  Unless, of course, you happen to be wearing it while trapped under ice alongside a leper messiah, who you are just discovering is of wolf and man.  You'll get whiplash trying to get away--sad but true--and your mind will fade to black just as the messiah whispers, ""Welcome home.""",B0002TNE1G
"honestly i am inlove with this tshirt it fits perfectly and its pretty badass but the front isn't exactly how its shown the color purple in the background on the front isn't even there i don't mind that much i still admire this shirt but a girl needs her purple ya know? love ittt great shirt, and its only 10 bucks . Why the hell not?",B0002TNE1G
"My boyfriend loved it. Hell, I wanted to keep it for myself.",B0002TNE1G
It was not a bravado shirt. If I knew that before hand I would have got a medium.,B0002TNE1G
Graphics are high quality.  It arrived on time and was as expected.  I would buy again from this seller.,B0002TNE1G
Arrived on time. Fits great. Love it.,B0002TNE1G
Great t-shirt for the die-hard Metallica fans out there. Fits just like any ordinary shirt would. Size is great.,B0002TNE1G
"Bravado has official licensing for Metallica merchandise, so don't worry about this t-shirt being a knock-off. Shirt is printed on a Alstyle t-shirt, so if you already have any shirts made by them, you'll be able to tell what size you need.",B0002TNE1G
AWESOME QUALITY T!!  LOVE IT!!  THANKS!!,B0002TNE1G
"The shirt fits good, design stays after being washed many times.",B0002TNE1G
"I've been looking for this shirt for a long time and when I saw the price I had to get it. I ordered a large and washed it twice and it shrunk a bit, but I ordered a large for that reason.",B0002TNE1G
It was torn a bit from the sleve but I was gonna rip the sleves anyways,B0002TNE1G
"Bought xl, Shrunk  to a very small L. Go an extra size up",B0002TNE1G
I have one before and now it's time to replace to a new,B0002TNE1G
i guess it was an alright shirt. only wore it once cause when i washed it stretched when i hung it up on the collar,B0002TNE1G
I bought this for my husband for father's day and he loves it!,B0002TNE1G
"I read another review that suggested ordering a size up. I got the 2XL and I can swim in it. It's huge. It shrank in the dryer but nothing great, order a size that did you.",B0002TNE1G
My husband needed a 'refreshed' shirt.  His current one was all faded.,B0002TNE1G
"would recommend, use this seller again",B0002TNE1G
Fits well! Thick t shirt. Fits like the size you want it to be. Get the shirt. Love it. Love it,B0002TNE1G
love this Shirt i like the printing and the back printing is cool too but the shirt is too thick. very warm if you wear it on summer. im very sensitive on hot weather so i won't wear this until winter. but the shirt rocks! i recommend this to Metallica fans!,B0002TNE1G
"The t-shirt has came as i was expected, the fabric is quite good,It fits perfectly, and the printing is OK. My wife loves it because it has  both sides printed. It came earlier than it was predicted. Thanks.",B0002TNE1G
"If you're a Metallica fan or if Ride The Lightning happens to be your favorite album by Metallica, you definitely need to purchase this shirt. It's comfortable and very artistic. Loved the front, and especially the back! I've bought this product recently and I was immensely happy when I received it. The price is very affordable and the product isn't cheap. I couldn't honestly ask for more. Love this shirt.",B0002TNE1G
This shirt is really awesome looking and everywhere I go someone is telling me how cool it is I also  liked the fact of how fast I received it as well as the price that I paid for it was a real bargain,B0002TNE1G
Love the art work and the graphics of the shirt. Even glows on the back side as well. didn't realize it until i turned the lights off.,B0002TNE1G
"A bit small for a large size T-shirt, but overall a good deal at the price. I would buy again perhaps it was just this one shirt that was not a perfect piece.",B0002TNE1G
"As a big Metallica fan and Ride the Lightning being one of my favorite albums, I had to get this shirt and I am glad I did. Well made and comfortable.",B0002TNE1G
"Not only is this shirt pretty cool, it fits really well. not too baggy. Also the color did not bleed in the washer like a lot of cheap shirts. A+!",B0002TNE1G
"Not much to say, It's a great t-shirt.

Advice:  Usually I'm large, these t-shirts are big. Large feels like a regular X-Large",B0002TNE1G
I love the printing on this and the fit and weight is very comfortable and perfect for summertime outdoor concerts and fests.,B0002TNE1G
"It's an average t-shirt, with an ok print on it. I was expecting better quality fabric and a good print for the price. Fabric is too thin for my liking and the print is very low-def, like pixelated. If you want a high quality product look at other offerings",B0002TNE1G
"great band, great print, great shirt.

fits how i expected. very cool looking shirt get complements all the time. yo",B0002TNE1G
"This shirt is a perfect fit, the material feels great, and the printing job is vibrant, large and colorful on the front and the back. I would've liked it better if the 'Ride the Lightning' text had been written in the same typeface as it was written on the album cover, but it's not a big deal. Lots of metalheads give me compliments on this shirt right here.",B0002TNE1G
"I personally cut the sleeves off so I can wear it while I run and bike (kind of like Luke Glanton from ""The Place Beyond The Pines"") and it is just wonderful :)",B0002TNE1G
I tried on the shirt and it fit very well. It was not faded and was in perfect condition. The packing was exceptional and the shirt itself was very comfortable. A great buy!!!,B0002TNE1G
I accidentally ordered two of these but no worries gave one to my other son.  Got here quick and they loved them,B0002TNE1G
"Love the shirt in general, but at the time of purchase i was unaware of the artwork on the back of the shirt.",B0002TNE1G
"This shirt was exactly what I was looking for and a wonderful price. Bought for my Nephew and he loved it, fit perfectly.",B0002TNE1G
Very good quality shirt and it got to me Very fast. I would definitely recommend. I ordered the extra large and it was just a bit small so I might go up a size.,B0002TNE1G
My nephew is a big Metallica fan so he got this for Christmas and immediately put it on once he opened the box.,B0002TNE1G
"Great graphics, shirt is a Hanes (kudos!), and really looks great. The graphics are on straight and centered. Good job guys!",B0002TNE1G
Great Shirt my step dad had all his Concert Tees thrown out when he was younger(got in trouble long story) anyways so for xmas i figured id buy him this lets just say he loves it and it brought back many memories. Well made i believe its cotton graphically its very clean and crisp. Good Job Bravado.,B0002TNE1G
I bought this shirt for my son for his birthday and he loved it!  He asked for this shirt and I was glad it was available for purchase.,B0002TNE1G
This is an awesome t shirt that draws a lot of attention due to the fact that Metallica is an awesome band.,B0002TNE1G
"i saw a similar design in a shop. but nevertheless, the quality of this shirt is still good.good buy..do it.",B0002TNE1G
"This was a great replacement for my original ""Ride the Lightning"" shirt that I had worn until there were more holes than material. It is a reproduction, but it's good quality material. I always order a size up to allow for shrinkage. It's a good shirt for a good price. =)",B0002TNE1G
"The t-shirt is good quality, but there was not a picture on the item listing of the picture on the back and I'm not sure if I like it, it is a big skeleton being electrocuted in an electric chair.",B0002TNE1G
"I wear a size 2xl tee shirts.
Of course since it is a Tee Shirt I wear it.
It is made of cotton material,
It was bought brand new.
It will came in a cardboard box that the shirt neatly was folded in its own sealed see through plastic bag. And in between the cardboard box and the plastic bag was bubble wrap for even more protection,
I was impressed by them having both the sealed plastic bag and bubble wrap as double the protection.",B0002TNE1G
This shirt is a classic Super comfy and the designs are awesome. It actually matches up quite well with a variety of colors.,B0002TNE1G
"I bought this shirt because I thought the back glowed in the dark. I had one years ago that glowed in the dark just like it. Just to comfirm to everyone,this shirt does not glow in the dark.",B0002TNE1G
"I love this shirt! I often have a problem with t-shirts being too soft, that will loose their shape when washing; or too rough on the skin, that you can't move with comfort. I nailed it with this shirt! The blend it's just so comfortable! The print looks great too. Great colors! Will buy again other designs but the same t-shirt brand. Thank you Bravado, Amazon & with Old Glory I got a discount! Great combo!",B0002TNE1G
Husband will probly never wear and a little to big for me of course guess not to sleep in who doesnt like a killer Metallica tshirt!,B0002TNE1G
This t-shirt runs true to size and the print looks great. My husband says that it feels great too. Definitely worth it!,B0002TNE1G
"thanks Bravado, this metallica ride the lightning album T-shirt is the very nice t-Shirt, next i will buy again bravado products...",B0002TNE1G
It fit the person who I got it for perfectly and this specific shirt had the back too unlike most Ride the Lightning shirts. I would highly recommend.,B0002TNE1G
"I bought this to replace a similar shirt I bought over 10 years ago that finally started to come apart. The new shirt is much thinner material than the old one, so I doubt it will last nearly as long. But the graphics are good and it's comfortable.",B0002TNE1G
Got this for a mentally challenged young friend who loves this group and the shirts are so hard to find..this was supper and got it in 2x also so hard to find ...very happy for him!!!!,B0002TNE1G
"I hope the print holds up, it looks like it will. i don't remember reading it in the description but the skeleton on the back is glow in the dark.",B0002TNE1G
"Its not too hard to find a good Metallica shirt, and this Ride The Lightning shirt is pretty good as far as the front logo and the price go, however back logo of the electric chair victim takes away a bit of the seriousness from the tone of the album. 4 stars",B0002TNE1G
"Wear this to Wal-Mart and be the center of attention. No one wears concert t's anymore. 'Cept me! This is a great album, concert, and tshirt! All of the dads that you see will have a great story about the first time they heard ""Fade To Black"".",B0002TNE1G
Good quality unbeatable price i just love this shirt it is really good you won't believe it when you get to have it,B0002TNE1G
"It's a good t-shirt (made in Mexico), good quality cotton and design but the Metallica logo is different:  the grey part is really black.",B0002TNE1G
"Son loves it, Great graphics, his favorite band. However, I bought the same size he wears all the time, and it was a little snug. I would recommend ordering one size larger than your regular size.",B0002TNE1G
"Good shirt,nice price,as described,wanted one for a while,had the metal up your ass version on front.......but i sold that one!!",B0002TNE1G
This was an amazing shirt cause it is the one that has the guy in the electric chair on the back. Bonus! The quality is good too.,B0002TNE1G
"These rock t-shirts are the same t-shirts being sold at JC Penney, Mervyn's, etc. The shirt is made by Hanes, so it's a good quality t-shirt and you know what to expect in terms of how it fits and what size you need to buy.",B0002TNE1G
"GREAT PRICE! UNBELIEVABLE! Good quality material, thick not that thin-ratty junk. Been washed several times and still holding color AND the skeleton on the back GLOWS IN THE DARK! Wicked!",B0002TNE1G
"The shirt is awesome. It is made with great quality and from what I can tell, some real quality fabric. The shirt fits fantastic and I would recommend this brand to anybody.",B0002TNE1G
"This is awesome shirt shirt, exactly what I was looking for. Made my day at the Metallica concert. The quality of the shirt is great and the printing is even better.",B0002TNE1G
I purchased this t-shirt and is flaud. The neck of the shirt is not sewed correctly and is unwearable. I wouldnt order this product again..,B0002TNE1G
This shirt looked awesome when I saw it and when I tried it on! The both designs in the front and the back are cool... Until it got stolen while washing them at a public laundry mat :'(,B0002TNE1G
"the print is good. and obviously you'll like it. but the cloth is not as good as it seems. overall, a good t-shirt with which you can show off your love for metallica  \m/",B0002TNE1G
The shirt was of acceptable quality (ie. what I was expecting) and arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Would purchase from this vendor again.,B0002TNE1G
Metallica!! I got this before I went to big 4 it was epic I received the t-shirt in time and great price,B0002TNE1G
Material was thin but still durable and definitely worth the price,B0002TNE1G
my step dad ripped his shirt working on my car and i bought him this to replace it.,B0002TNE1G
Boyfriend loves and looks hot in it!,B0002TNE1G
"Very cool design. Material could be more comfortable, but I'm sure a couple washes will fix that",B0002TNE1G
No complaints. Just wish the shirt was made of thicker/better quality.,B0002TNE1G
The fabric is good quality and my son really enjoys it,B0002TNE1G
I bought this as a gift for my wife who has been a huge fan of the band since her teenage years. The fit is perfect and she looks really good in it. She happy so Im happy.,B0002TNE1G
I really like Alia slacks. They are true to size and easy care. The pants that arrived were of some different material (micro-fiber) and looked like rags.  REALLY DISAPPOINTING. The micro-fiber pants don't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist isn't as comfortable either.  I sent them back for a refund.,B0002U12A0
"Love the fit and the sizing.  However, it is a LINT MAGNET!!!!  Awful.  Bought the white in Canada some years ago and their beautiful fabric and fit inspired me to buy the black.  A bit disappointed.",B0002U12A0
"I am so happy that this product comes in actual sizes other than S, M and L.  And though I am tall, the length is perfect.  These slacks fit extremely well and are therefore very comfortable.  I have several pair and will no doubt get more.",B0002U12A0
"My favorite pair of pants.  I was disappointed when they were not in stock in Beall's so I decided to see if Amazon offered them.  This is much easier than going to the store.  Will buy more online.  They fit my body perfectly.  I need elastic waist pants as I'm 74 and thicker around the waist than I used to be!  I'm 5' 5"" tall and these are a little long but not long enough to have to hem.  Very soft material.  Can be worn as dress pants or casual.",B0002U12A0
I love these pants because I like the feel of the fabric,B0002U12A0
"Love these Slacks.  You can wear them as Dressy or Casual.
Perfect",B0002U12A0
"It would be so nice if manufacturers could come up with a standard for sizing that all companies, states, and countries use so consumers could buy with confidence.  The items I bought were too large, hang baggy,not my true size at all.  So sad...",B0002U12A0
They were made for someone with a gigantic belly and no hips or seat.  They fit terribly. Very uncomfortable.  Not made for women.  Made more for men with beer bellies.,B0002U12A0
These were for my mother.  She was very happy that they fit so well.,B0002U12MS
Love these pant. Comfortable and wrinkle resistant.,B0002U12MS
"Fit is fine, only a little long even for a short size.  Otherwise I like it fine.",B0002U12MS
"This is the second order I made for these pants in this color.  The first order was for Size 12 Regular.  Size 12 S (Short)arrived so I assumed that I had made a mistake in ordering. I am a tall person so Size 12 S is far too short. The second order I placed was for Size 12 and although I was very careful to order the correct size (12 Regular), I was sent Size 12 Short.  It is too complicated for me to return these pants as I live outside the USA.  I will not be ordering from this company again.",B0002U12MS
"Have and will continue to use these culotte slips for many years, especially during the hot, sticky days of summer.  Bought several sets for me and my mother (who had been asking for these since her sister ""stole"" them from her last summer) to replace our old ones in 9-inch inseam length.  Kept those for my mother in that length, but exchanged mine for the 4-inch inseam because of my skirt lengths (usually to the knee) in the summer.  The slips are comfortably loose, help prevent thighs chafing, keep you cooler, and bring a cleaner line and cover to light or sheer skirts. Since they fit loosely the 4-inch inseam slips fall to mid thigh; while the 9-inch fall to the knee.  The lace adds a nice touch--not scratchy or stiff; and they launder in a breeze.",B0002UBSAE
"I have a medical skin condition which i cannot wear cotton these are great nylon slips they are cool loose and fit comfortably under cotton shorts i can't even wear pants because
heat & sweating causes my skin to breakout due to heat sweating bacteria this is why these are such a great buy..

i would recommend these to anyone. i like these so much i have over 30 pair which i wear them daily over womens nylon stretch lace panties..",B0002UBSAE
"These pettipants were what I wanted. The lace in the black color was slightly differnt than the picture, but still nice.",B0002UBSAE
"Love to wear skirts without hose and this is perfect for summer here where it regularly gets over 100 degrees. Keeps the ol' thighs from painfully rubbing together and is much more comfortable than the old style bike shorts since so much looser with flowy skirt styles. You won't want anyone to know you wear them, but trust me, you will wear them all the time.",B0002UBSAE
"Probably could have gone down a size, but keeping anyway. I love these Pettipants now as I did in the 60's, 70's and 80's!! I still have my original ones!!!",B0002UBSAE
"Waistband a bit small but quality very nice, legs roomy.  Have worn all colors several times so far with pleasant results.  The nude is more like pale yellow, but that color still works fine as a neutral. They wash well, dry quickly, feel comfortable, and come in a well-priced bundle.  The lace trim looks very pretty.",B0002UBSAE
I wear these every time I put on one of my jean jumpers or skirts.  Cool and comfortable material and helps greatly with chafing.  They've held up very well over time and many washings.,B0002UBSAE
Exactly as I wanted and size was right on,B0002UBSAE
Wish there were a simple hem instead of lace at the bottom.,B0002UBSAE
These pettipants fit well and make me feel comfortable under my dresses and skirts.  I would totally recommend.  You get 3 basically for the price of 1.,B0002UBSAE
No more chafed thighs! Cool & light. Perfect for dresses & skirts.,B0002UBSAE
I could never wear skirts because my thighs are very friendly and it becomes uncomfortable.  With these I don't have to worry about the chub rub.,B0002UBSAE
I am very pleased with these. I am headed to Romania and Greece and am sure these will be cool under a skirt.,B0002UBSAE
"I love my bloomers!  I usually have to wear a slip and some kind of shorts or something to be comfortable in my skirts, but this combines the best of  both worlds.  I especially like them when it is windy, because they stay in place even when my skirt doesn't.  They are also a good length that gives me the comfort of knowing that they cover what a slip should, and do not stick out where a slip should not.  I love them!",B0002UBSAE
"Super cool and comfy in hot weather. Very retro look, good for rockabilly and jitterbugging fashions.",B0002UBSAE
Roomy and wide waisted. I'm short and have to roll them at the top or they are below my sundresses. I'd go a size smaller and doubt you'd lose any volume.,B0002UBSAE
My husband loves them and wants to wear them all the time.,B0002UBSAE
"Cost less but excellent quality and fit. Bought the shorter ones for the wife cause I thought they were king of sexy. She liked them so much that she asked for more in the mid length size. Guys, great gift for the wife, way better then flowers of candy and they look good too. Just find a way to get a measuring tape around her waist on the sly and they size by waist and are right on. Personally I like the black. ;)",B0002UBSAE
"We bought these for my mother who is a larger woman. I ordered the size that corresponded with the regular underwear she normally wears. When they arrived, she loved the design but found that they were appx 1 1/2 to 2 sizes larger than her usual size. Other than that, she loved the fact that they didn't ""ride"" up her leg.",B0002UBSAE
"the fit was perfect, i love them, I have reordered a second time and recommended them to friends and family",B0002UBSAE
"These are great to have! I have bought other products in the past to wear under dresses to protect against ""chub rub"" and I couldn't wait to get home and get them off. These pettipants are very comfortable and breathable and best of all not restrictive! I usually buy petite items so the crotchet doesn't hang to my knees but theses fit just fine. I am buying the 4 inch inseam next. Thrilled with my purchase!",B0002UBSAE
Better than regular slips.  They wash great.  I wear a size 14 and have a proportional figure.  I should have ordered a medium instead of a large.  It fits a little to big.,B0002UBSAE
"I love these long bloomers for wearing under my long skirts and long dresses.  Keeps those chubby inner thighs from rubbing together and makes me feel so comfortable. For so long I did not wear long skirts and dresses for the above reasons. Now I can!  Also Underworks Pettipants are less expensive and just as good quality.
Like these better than cotton ones as cotton ones don't move as freely as the Nylon ones.",B0002UBSAE
"I love to wear  dresses but with pantyhose out of style, dresses are uncomfortable with my sit-down job.  These provide the cover of a light slip and the comfort of the culotte approach, especially on a hot humid day!  I have 3 pair and they are wonderful.",B0002UBSAE
"I don't enjoy wearing a full slip, and the half-slips don't always work with slit skirts.  But, these fit the the bill.  They are easy to wear and very comfortable.",B0002UBSAE
"I've decided to wear more skirts in the summer.  I like them better than pants or shorts, and pettipants make them easy and comfortable to wear.",B0002UBSAE
This was a little large in certain areas.  It is like it is a one size fits all for larger women.,B0002UBSAE
"I am 24 years old, thin; I live in an urban area, I go bar hopping, I drink (plenty).  I do not know how to knit; I have never served a Sunday roast; I do not dress particularly modestly.  However, these bloomers -- despite their stodgy reputation -- are one of the best purchases I have made in the past 6 months.

They are so airy and comfortable when I traipse down the humid streets of my city, and I do not experience the uncomfortable ""chub-chafe"" that occurs between every healthy woman's thighs as she sweats in her dress or skirt on a hot summer's day.  When I am sitting on the metro, I take comfort knowing that the creepy man staring at me across the car cannot, in fact, see up my dress.  Sometimes the lace peeks out a bit at the bottom of my dress... but it just looks cute.  They help make dressing up for work/internships more fun.

I have not stopped talking about these to my female friends (and some male ones) since I have started wearing them. I cannot recommend these enough -- to all ages, despite the impression some people have that only people over 60 wear bloomers!",B0002UBSAE
"these are not exactly sexy but they are super comfortable and a great piece for under skirts in the summer to keep you cool and fight chafing and in the winter over tights under a skirt they add a layer for warmth, not a lot but layers add up.  I love these and they are a stable of my summer wardrobe, they are long enough that they come down around my thighs and don't ride up too badly.",B0002UBSAE
"I find it much more comfortable to wear skirts with these than without them. I'd prefer them without the lace, and I'd prefer them to be about 1/2"" to 1"" shorter, but they're still the best product I've found. Highly recommend.",B0002UBSAE
"I am a plus size male and I have bought several of these Underworks pettipants, both the short and the long, the cotton and the nylon tricot.  I especially like the nylon underpants, and wear them almost all the time, including bedtime, when I normally wear a nylon nightgown.  The nylon fabric feels great against my skin, and the lace trim adds a nice feminine touch that I love.  I would recommend these underpants to any man who would like a great alternative to the usual male boxers/jockey shorts and who does not  have a problem wearing woman's undergarments.",B0002UBSAE
They are nice and fit fine but are shorter than I thought they would be. They have held up well.,B0002UBSAE
Perfect for dress/skirt or slacks.,B0002UBSAE
"I love them, nice fit and very comfortable.",B0002UBSAE
Great alternative to traditional half slip. Prevents thigh rub.,B0002UBSAE
I LOVE this product. As a plus sized gal the heat is my enemy. I can wear these without leggings or hose and free up my legs for the summer. The size is as advertised and the inseam length means I don't have ride-up issues but I can wear skirts just above the knee and they don't show. Can not recommend highly enough.,B0002UBSAE
"came in timely fashion, good brand of shirt, printing looks good, { i was worried it was gonna be like homeade, crooked etc..] would buy again and reccomend",B0002UCPQ0
Ordered it for my son and size was good and material quality was also good.  He is pleased with the gift.,B0002UCPQ0
Always a little unsure about ordering t-shirts online.  Many times the quality is not the best.  This was not the case with this shirt.  I have washed it many times and it looks like new.,B0002UCPQ0
"What you see is what you get.  It's a glock shirt! It's awesome! Not any problems with shipper, came in very fast.",B0002UCPQ0
"Good fitm, I really like this shirt and the color is perfect for my lifestyle.

Thank you,

Mark S. Koslosky",B0002UCPQ0
nice shirt.  does not fade after washing.,B0002UCPQ0
Fit well and is a thicker style shirt. Will buy again.,B0002UCPQ0
"Well made, good material.  Love it.  Will be buying more.",B0002UCPQ0
"Only dry it the first time, then air dry to keep the size constant.",B0002UCPQ0
Better quality than I ever expected.  not the paper thin t-shirt material common on low cost garments.,B0002UCPQ0
"The screen print ink looks like it's mixed with kids tears from the sweatshop it was made from , way to go amazon selling horrible quality shirts shown as normal quality",B0002UCPQ0
Could have used a heavier cotton to make a better shirt that is going to hold up after many washings. I would not buy again.,B0002UCPQ0
It was a better looking & fitting t shirt then i expected...,B0002UCPQ0
"Great shirt perfect XL fit very heavy high quality cotton, Love this shirt",B0002UCPQ0
"Thought it would of been cotton, but apparently the shirt is a weird material- like a plastic bag",B0002UCPQ0
"Quality product, very satisfied!",B0002UCPQ0
"Great shirt, excellent quality.",B0002UCPQ0
"It's quite comfortable, yes. Does an excellent job at being a shirt. Not as great as shorts, but acceptable.",B0002UCPQ0
This shirt runs big. I normally wear XL but this one fits like an XXL.,B0002UCPQ0
washed it once and a the stitching come out of it on the sleeve now it's unwearable,B0002UCPQ0
"SHRUNK  big time not glock oem, its a horrible t shirt, use it as a shop rag",B0002UCPQ0
I purchased this product for my friend's birthday. It should make him very happy. I like the quality. I think I might order one for myself soon.,B0002UCPQ0
"This is made by Gildan so not the highest quality.  Decent shirt, but does shrink and fade.  You're paying for the logo, not the shirt.  Would not buy again, but not disappointed.",B0002UCPQ0
"The shirt is a decent black cotton T.  The lettering is not white, as it may appear on the front, but more of a metallic silver, as you may more readily pick up from a look at the lettering on the sleeve.",B0002UCPQ0
"This is a basic, cotton T-shirt at a good price.  It's not super heavy cotton, but not the cheapest out there either.
Will likely shrink in the wash. (I'd probably order a size up to account for shrinking of the cotton)

I ordered the XL, and it was only a tad tight... nothing a little stretch didn't fix.

Logo on front looks good, as does the logo on the sleeve.

Overall, good looking shirt.",B0002UCPQ0
"Good quality, a touch smaller than the average xl.",B0002UCPQ0
Was a gift and the person loves it.,B0002UCPQ0
I order an extra large and its probably a medium not even a large,B0002UCPQ0
"Most of my other xl shirts fit snug around my arms, this shirt ran a little bit bigger than my other shirts but it is still a really nice quality shirt over all. If you're a Glock fan you need this in your closet",B0002UCPQ0
wash it once and its a large now,B0002UCPQ0
"Awesome product and price! Good buy, will buy again.",B0002UCPQ0
"I want to say that i do like the shirt,though the one caveate would be, i state this before i have washed it. which the solution would be a cold only wash.maybe a size larger would have been prudent.",B0002UCPQ0
I where it with pride wish it came in white black gets a little hot during summer in far tip of the Sacramento valley  it fits great very little shrink,B0002UCPQ0
Lets people know you packing heat,B0002UCPQ0
I like the shirt but the fit is a little off.,B0002UCPQ0
I ordered the Extra Large and it looks like a Medium. My girlfriend now has a new Glock T-shirt.,B0002UCPQ0
A little pricy for nothing on back and a small symbol up front. Generally a good shirt though,B0002UCPQ0
"Nice quality shirt, size ran small",B0002UCPQ0
Nice subtle statement on who you support (carry),B0002UCPQ0
"Nice shirt fits well
GLOCK PERFECTION",B0002UCPQ0
Love the T! It always get a comment when I wear it out!,B0002UCPQ0
Very nice quality shirt. Very happy with this purchase!,B0002UCPQ0
"The shirt was somewhat thin. And the ""Glock Perfection"" symbol on the front was not clearly white; it was somewhat faded. They advertise the shirt as heavy, but it was not. And the emblems were pretty faded.",B0002UCPQ0
Got holes in the arm pits in two weeks,B0002UCPQ0
"Sticky substance on back of shirt upon arrival. Normal t shirt, just disappointed with that.",B0002UCPQ0
Nice shirt. But would be better if embroidered,B0002UCPQ0
"Exactly what I expected - very basic,simple sharp!",B0002UCPQ0
My husband loved this shirt. I am definitely considering getting him another for a Christmas present.,B0002UCPQ0
The construction of this shirt is good and it had held up to several washings without shrinking or fading.  One thing I really like about the shirt is that there is enough length to make it a good shirt for people who conceal carry.,B0002UCPQ0
"Nice shirt, heavy material for a T-shirt, logo is well done and should be relatively permanent.  Fits well.  Worth the money.",B0002UCPQ0
"The shirt is not bad, the material is okay a little rough. Not the best blend of cotton. There is a small Glock decal on the front as shown and a small Glock word on one sleeve. For the money is not bad, and I'll wear it but if I'd seen it in the store I would not have purchased.",B0002UCPQ0
I am pleased that Amazon sells quality products like this that are good quality and very attention getting.  Glock rocks!,B0002UCPQ0
My husband loves this shirt and he wears it all the time. It's made very well and yes I would recommended it for any Glock collector.,B0002UCPQ0
"Bought for my son, a Glock owner and avid sports shooter.  He was thrilled, and unlike many T-shirts made off-shore, the shirt ordered in his size actually fit perfectly and is of good quality material.",B0002UCPQ0
Like everything else glock has ever put their name on......flawless. It its what it is a short sleeve black tshirt with the glock name i would buy another,B0002UCPQ0
Good fit and they had my size and the color I was looking for. They had the product I wanted.,B0002UCPQ0
This was a nice shirt when I got it but soon after 3 washes the logo started to fade and the threading was coming undone.,B0002UCPQ0
"Nice fit, good material, writing seems durable. I will buy more in other colors as they become available. It's a no brainer.",B0002UCPQ0
I had one of these shirts before but it had a rip in the side. This is a good priced shirt and good quality,B0002UCPQ0
"I wouldn't expect anything less from Glock! I love all their product. I guess you can say that I am a fanboy. So I had to get this shirt to show my love. I couldn't be more happy with it. The picture doesn't show the nice ""GLOCK"" on the leave, but it was a nice surpise!",B0002UCPQ0
"Stitching on bottom came out after 10 min of wearing it. Definitely sad as otherwise it's a decent shirt. The glock logo is a little more ""glittery"" than I would have liked also. O well. Will make a good shop rag once it completely falls apart",B0002UCPQ0
"I gave this to my 30+ son and he really likes it.  It looks good on him.  The logo is just the right size - not overly huge but just there.  The shirt is a nice quality, too.  The size seems to run true to size.  It is a good purchase!",B0002UCPQ0
my grandson loved it and it arrived promptly and the quality was good.  A good addition to his Glock collection,B0002UCPQ0
"This shirt is nice and thick, but not uncomfortably so. It does run a bit small, but I read the reviews beforehand so I knew that. I get a lot of compliments on it. Recommended.",B0002UCPQ0
Bought it for nephew as a gift. He loved the style and fit.,B0002UCPQ0
"Really poor quality, shirt is very tight in the neck and itchy.",B0002UCPQ0
I like the look and fit of this shirt.,B0002UCPQ0
"Exactly as described and good quality shirt. Size was a bit bigger than normal, so maybe order a size down from what you normally are. Otherwise, great product.",B0002UCPQ0
"Nice shirt, but it attracts all kinds of fuzz and loose pet hair. Can't keep it from being furry",B0002UCPQ0
Super t-shirt. Great quality and craftsmanship.,B0002UCPQ0
 FOR THE PRICE IT IS REDICULOUS AND I AM UNSATISFIED. DO NOT BUY! ,B0002UD4Z6
"This fit as I had anticipated.  I had purchased a larger size a few years ago, but I had lost a lot of weight since then, but I still have a bit of a belly bulge I wanted to smooth so that I could feel comfortable tucking in my shirts.  This is a challenge to get on because it rolls up on the edges and you have to unroll it as you pull it down.  I usually try to grab the crotch flap by my upper back and pull that down to help, but you have to be pretty flexible to reach it.  My only other issue is the crotch flap.  I don't particularly like my privates squeezed against my body and going to the bathroom is a bit tricky with all the unbuttoning and buttoning.  I won't elaborate on my work around for this.",B0002UD4Z6
"This is excellent for those of us in the obese category. It provides very firm compression, reducing embarrassing jiggle worries, and in addition, it eliminates the all-too-common fat man's plumber's crack. The previous review talks about it ripping hair off. I'm thinking he must have purchased a bit optimistically on the sizing. Be realistic with yourself, follow the sizing guidelines, and it shouldn't rip any hair off. I'm in the almost-werewolf category of body hair, and I haven't had any problems. Enjoy.",B0002UD4Z6
OMG!! You better be hairless to wear this. It is compression all right. Tears every hair off your body as you pull it up. AND I was on the border between sizes and ordered up!! Save you money and go on a diet like I did!!,B0002UD4Z6
"I know that they're supposed to be a bit big, but they seem to be almost a full size off. And the pair I got don't make me swear as much as I was expecting.",B0002URCMC
Excellent product at the right price. It warms but is not too hot. Good for training. Fit as expected. No complains at all,B0002URCMC
It's too small... I thought a large size would be actually LARGE.. This can fit my little sister that's 13 years old. Really desappointed.,B0002URCMC
"I had purchased a large (my size), expecting it to have a roomy fit. When it came, it felt like a child's large as opposed to an adult large. It was also much thinner than I thought it would be. I used to have a pair of rip stop shorts like these, so I was very disappointed that these shorts did not live up to my expectation.",B0002URCMC
rip stop great shorts - i will order them again the do allow you to sweat which is what i love about them,B0002URCMC
The Rip Stop short is of excellent quality to practice at home or take class in. I highly recommend it for the serious dancer or for the adult taking class for the first time. The size was exact.,B0002URCMC
"I bought 2 pairs.  They were a Christmas gift for our daughter out of state.
They were just what she wanted, to wear after her ballet classes.  She is very happy with them.",B0002URCMC
Didn't realize you can't exchange or return this item. I bought a Medium for my 11 year old daughter and it's way too big. :( great shorts if I could get the right size!,B0002URCMC
"These are perfect!  Good fabric, good construction, fits perfectly.  Will order more.",B0002URCMC
Daughter loves these for dance. They are comfortable and seem to hold up well to wear and washing.,B0002URCMC
You will sweat and fits good under clothing,B0002URCMC
Good Purchase!  My Ballerina loves them!,B0002URCMC
"My daughter is very thin but tall and usually wears a small, but I ordered a medium and they were still a little small for her. We will make it work!",B0002URCMC
"Love these for dance I'm a bigger gal so I got the xl, I usually wear size 10 in pants, these fit no wiggle room though.",B0002URCMC
"I'm a ballet dancer and LOVE these ""garbage"" pants for warming up. I recommend getting one size up. I'm usually a size small, but the elastic waistband was cutting into my stomach. I got a medium and MUCH better fit!",B0002URCMC
"Perfect for someone smaller, even though I got an extra large.  A large dancer is still small by ordinary standards.",B0002URCMC
This is not an adult woman's large. It was too tight for a size 14 woman.,B0002URCMC
"I loved these shorts. I'm 5 foot and 105 pounds. I got the small and they were a little tight at first, but I do think they stretch out a little. They are perfect for any dancer taking more than one class a day, warming up on stage before preforming, or trying to keep your muscles warm back stage. Plus I think that they make your legs look really good. Just my opinion :)",B0002URCMC
"I'm 5""00 and bought a small, but it fit tight around the legs and waist. I would suggest ordering a size up.",B0002URCMC
"Very light weight bloomer. Fits well on me. I'm 5'5, usually medium in dance wears. My thighs are not slim. However if you have lots of muscles on your thighs, you may want to size up.",B0002URCMC
"I love these shorts. I'm 5'2"" and 130 lbs. I bought the black in XL because I knew the leg holes would be tight. I liked them so much that I went to a store and bought the teal in a size L and they still fit comfortably.

When ordering ballet/dancewear, make sure to order a size larger than your street size.",B0002URCMC
"I find that these shorts fit well and have proved to be durable (I washed them on a low cycle). They do a wonderful job of helping your muscles warm up quickly and stay warm while you are not dancing.
The fit is such that you can leave them on while you dance, and they don't inhibit your movement at all. Developpe away!
The purple color is also very nice; I like having purple shorts as they are less common than black, and look just as well.
These shorts are true to size.",B0002URCMC
"Lightweight, keeps you warm without overheating, great price! My daughter is very petite (5'2 99 lbs) but in the dance world she normally wears adult small but we decided to order a size larger (adult medium) so they don't rip when she does her over splits. She loves them- she just rolls the waist down a bit over her leotard & shes good to go! Getting ready to purchase the pants as well ;)",B0002URCMC
These shorts are great! My dancer absolutely loves them!,B0002URCMC
"Love these little bloomers! Cute, great for warming up, and true to size. I am a size 6 in jeans but have large thighs (20-21 inches) so I decided to get a large so the elastics at the thighs wouldn't be too uncomfortable. I would say these fit a bit smaller than the pants, as I am swimming in the large pants but quite comfy in the large bloomers. They are as depicted. I got black and plum. The plum is  true deep plum, not purple. Love it!",B0002URCMC
"great body wrapper quality!
love the fit and feel!",B0002URCMC
SOO glad I read previous reviews and ordered an XL. I have a petite figure but I definitely have thick thighs and a booty so any smaller and these would've been too snug for my taste. My street pant size ranges from 6-8 but I never would've guessed I had to get an extra large in these.,B0002URCMC
My daughter is happy with these!,B0002URCMC
"I am taking ballet and wanted to have this pants, I'm average size, so I got a large do they weren't too tight. OMG, the large size felt like a medium. These pants are only made for skinny women. If you are average or big don't even think you will find a size that fits appropiately. I was really frustrated.",B0002URCMC
My daughter wears these shorts (and the pants) over her leotard when she goes to ballet.  Everyone at ballet is wearing them.  They all seem to love both the shorts and pants.,B0002URCMC
The shirt arrived early. It's really cute. Just like it appears in the photo.,B0002URCMC
"Nice, light weight warm up/cover up.  Loose fit; elastic holds in place without being overly tight.",B0002URCMC
I ordered two sizes larger than I would normally.,B0002URCMC
"...but I still thought an xl would work. It now goes into my ""stuff I can wear once I lose 2 inches off my hips"" pile. Dance clothes just reinforce the idea that in order to be considered a dancer, one must adhere to a certain body shape and size. As a tall, thick, and muscular woman (not girl) it can be disheartening at times.

3 stars cause I can't wear them yet to see if they hold up. The arrived quickly and appear to be as advertised as far as material and construction. I'll try and remember to come back when I can can give an update.",B0002URCMC
"Though Id normally wear a small to medium, Id forgotten how the sizing would change for Ballet gear. While the shorts may technically fit elastic would be so uncomfortable that an xl would probably be better (56, 145) as most dancers would want to wear these loose and with a rolled waist. Annoyingly they cant be returned.",B0002URCMC
Ordered the shorts. Was given the pants instead,B0002URCMC
I used the reviews to chose the size right for my daughter and yes it worked! The right size for a girl who wears 0-2 in clothing or 25 in pants is the Medium of these.,B0002URCMC
"I got this for ballet class. I'm usually in between medium and small and I wanted the shorts to be a little big and baggy so I got a medium. They are pretty tight still but i can still do splits without ths seam feeling tight. If I could go back in time I'd buy a large instead for a baggier fit. Also these aren't really great for creating warmth, but they look cute and keep a small amount of heat in.",B0002URCMC
"My son loves these. He's a size 12-14 in kids clothing, and these fit him just fine. Thanks!!",B0002URCMC
Good fit. does what it is supposed to.,B0002URCMC
It's perfect. I'm 1.75 cm.. Bought L size and it's perfect.,B0002URCMC
This is a Christmas present for my daughter! Pretty sure shell be very happy :),B0002URCMC
Just what my daughter was hoping for.,B0002URCMC
"great for dance and ballet classes, very comfortable and doenst smell bad, great to wear at classes, totally recommend it",B0002UR7SQ
The elastic allows you to wear them as pants or shorts and they're really warm and durable. Perfect for warming up at the barre.,B0002UR7SQ
"this is really comfortable!!! i't's really thin, so it doesn't sofocate after warm up.
My hips are kinda large (39 inches), and I purchased an M, fits great!!!!!",B0002UR7SQ
"I bought 2 pairs of these (in different sizes,maybe medium and large,the print on the tags washed out so I'm not sure),years ago,directly from the Dance Distributors catalog. I still have them. They look like new and I get plenty of wear out of them. I also worked out in them and I would say that if you plan to do that,buy a roomy size or compensate by not stressing the middle seam(like if your exercises or activities involve spreading your feet wide apart...the smaller size I got developed a little split on the seam that was small and easy to sew back up). Beyond that,they're like summer weight sweat pants(in that they look like sweat pants but are very lightweight and comfortable in summer weather),they're slippery so you can slip other pants or sweat pants over them if you're going to the gym or just leaving the house and would rather be dressed in more street-type clothes while you're doing shopping or whatever...I like these and got another pair recently from amazon. Plus they're black/black and stay that way(not double-dyed black but definitely as black as a black car is(what I mean is,because they're rip-stop nylon,they don't fade at all with normal washing). These are very comfortable and baggy.",B0002UR7SQ
"My daughter's ballet teacher recommended this warm up to keep her muscles warm to and from dance and at barre. Well made, XS fit her, she's 5'5"" and 100 lbs.",B0002UR7SQ
Exactly what my daughter needed for warm ups at ballet.  Ladies small fits my 11yo (she wears children's 12) with plenty of room to grow.,B0002UR7SQ
Love the feel but they ripped the first time my daughter wore them for warm ups!,B0002UR7SQ
My daughter is a dancer and loves these!! They are baggy which makes it easy for movement. Definitely worth the buy!!,B0002UR7SQ
Got a medium for my 54 140 pound ballet dancing daughter. She said they are way too big!!! So she won't wear them. I think thats probably the style of this pant but shes from the super skinny pant generation so these pants go against everything she stands for. They are well made. No issues.,B0002UR7SQ
"Fits well. I'm a medium, but ordered L",B0002UR7SQ
"Gave as a gift to my 12 year old granddaughter, and she loves them.  This will be her first year of toe class, so she is super excited.",B0002UR7SQ
My daughter loves these! They are comfortable and easy to move in and quickly slide on and off.  Definitely worth the purchase.,B0002UR7SQ
"Great for backpacking wind pants!!!
perfect! 3.5 oz, no pockets, and cheap!",B0002UR7SQ
"These are great. They do shrink after a couple of washes (I let air dry, never put in dryer)....",B0002UR7SQ
So disappointed.  Granddaughter needed them for competition and they were too big.  She had to have plum and they were only available in XS.  She is 14 and hoped they would fit.  Very disappointed.,B0002UR7SQ
I did not like it at all.  It's very baggy.,B0002UR7SQ
"I love these pants, they are so incredibly light, but somehow quite warm. I put them on over a leo and tights and INSTANTLY feel warmth once the pants go on, as if all my body heat suddenly gets trapped inside and radiates back to me. To give you a sense of size, I'm 5'5"" 123 pounds, VERY curvy hips with smaller thighs. I got the Medium. They aren't too tight or too loose, they are exactly as I would expect them to fit, pretty much just like the picture for the product shows, which means plenty baggy and roomy but not overly so.  They go right down to my ankles, the perfect length. I can keep them unrolled at the waist and they go right up to the bottom of my breasts to keep my entire abd warm if needed, but usually I wear them rolled down to the hips. So cute.

The other day I was taking my puppy for a walk on some trails, and by the time I arrived, it was EXTREMELY gusty with a cold February wind blowing everywhere. Luckly I had these in my car and I slipped them on over my running tights, viola! I had some instant wind breaking pants on. They're not completely wind-stopping, but they definitely helped out in a pinch, without these I would have had to turn around and go home.

As for durability, I've only worn them a handful of times, but my puppy with her sharp puppy claws climbed all over me the other day while I was wearing these, and although her claws seemed to be ripping into them, they held up to the beating. So far no rips.",B0002UR7SQ
These are used for backpacking in the snow.  Kept me dry and warm.,B0002UR7SQ
"I ordered the medium, based on the reviews. I wanted to have room and to be a Kevin to roll the waste. 5' 5"" misses size 4. Although in the cold, these are not warm, as soon as you start to warm up, they do a great job of holding in your body heat.",B0002UR7SQ
"Xmas present for 11 year old dancer.  Shes very tall, wears a 14/16, bought her the adult xs, they're perfect",B0002UR7SQ
It's already stating to rip on the bottom of the leg where it tapers around the ankle.  It doesn't seem like it will be very durable.,B0002UR7SQ
"I am a man, 5'9"", 160 lb., 32"" waist.  I got the medium.  It fits without restriction (but see below), and the ankle elastics keep me from walking on the cuffs.

I notice that women a lot smaller than I am are happy with the large, and I guess this is because their natural waist is higher than mine.

I bought these to put on after a ballet class to stay warm for an hour until a conditioning class at the same studio.  They hold heat while I am standing still, but air seems to flow right through them if I walk.  I had to run outside to my vehicle on a cold day, and I might as well have been outside with no pants, temperature-wise.

The conditioning class is murderously intense.  Planks, crunches, burpees, wall sits, jump rope for a long time, more crunches and planks, stretchy band upper body stuff, jump shots, mountain climbers.  It causes me to sweat.  The pants did not get hot, and they did not get overly sweaty inside.  That's fine.  I actually bought these at the studio because I forgot my regular sweat pants.

They were not restrictive exactly, but as my legs got sweaty and sticky, they occasionally caught on the fabric, which does not stretch, and there was some restriction just very occasionally as a result.  I think that if I was wearing one size larger, it might never have happened.  It doesn't happen with fleece sweat pants, because fleece sweat pants stretch.  These don't, and if they can't slide over the skin, there is the occasional restriction.

I will probably continue to use these for conditioning class, because they are not as hot as a pair of sweat pants, and because I don't like how wearing shorts results in my putting my bare sweating legs on a floor where people walk with shoes.

I will try and keep track of how many washings I get out of these before they fail.",B0002UR7SQ
Great product!! I loved it and I received faster than I thought.,B0002UR7SQ
"The product is great , the finished on the legs has to be reinforced ,it rips by washing. Not the waist , which is wider than the other products I know, very comfortable and it does not ripe. Please when you correct it , let me try it, I use then 4 to 5 times a week in the Zumba class. Very confortable, I gave my classmates the etiquette to order.",B0002UR7SQ
it fits really well! I am 5'5 and have s,B0002UR7SQ
These work and haven't ripped yet. I'm 135 lbs. and 5'3 and I chose medium. They sit high on my waist with a medium so if u want them to be more baggy choose a bigger size. I use them in the sauna or to work out at home and they get me sweating exactly where I want it which is my waist and legs. They haven't ripped yet and other sauna pants rip as soon as u try to work out in them,B0002UR7SQ
Most other Body Wrappers stuff in XL fits me fine.  These were a bit snug.,B0002UR7SQ
"It arrived on time and it fit perfectly! Oversized, was what I wanted and I ordered accordingly. It came as expected and it's currently one of my favorite pieces of dancewear",B0002UR7SQ
"I wore them for the first time today. The pants are very thin and very lightweight, yet keep me warm before and during barre, so that's great. They feel nice when you have them on and do not make annoying swishing sounds. However, after one wear (a 2 hour ballet technique + pointe technique class), I was saddened to find a 6inch tear along one of the seams nerve the ankle. The pants are very big on me and as well as long (I'm 5'7 and a dress size 4-6) but I ordered a large as I like baggier warmups sometimes, and they're fine. If I had to reorder I would likely get a medium though. These could easily work for men or very tall women as they are very long in the legs. The waist goes up to my breasts if not rolled down. This likely means a person with larger hips would have no issue with them. I wanted so badly to give these a 5 but I wasn't doing anything that could have ripped them in the ankle area, and after just one wear it really disappoints me.",B0002UR7SQ
"I'm an old dancer and used to have these in every color in my undergraduate dance days.  They are still my favorite warm up wear, and these were reasonably priced, came in a timely fashion and fit great.",B0002UR7SQ
Body Wrappers Ripstop Pants is loose fit and good for warm-up exercises.,B0002UR7SQ
"I bought these because everyone at my studio had them, and I am not dissapointed!",B0002UR7SQ
Love it - I have two of them.  Seem to keep me room temperature and so durable.  Great Investment.,B0002UR7SQ
"very comfortable, but, it's too large.
I have very fat legs (AF jeans size 4 or 6), so I ordered x-large.  I felt medium is enough.......",B0002UR7SQ
"As a petite, it got a little big on the legs, But I can roll the waist and everything is fine. Keeps you very warm. The fabric is a little thicker than I expected, but do not affect your movements.",B0002UR7SQ

still had a little extra to pull over my belly so i can srink in that area as well my roommate when they saw them wanted them as well,B0002UR7SQ
Looks like my size 4 (pre prego) jeans - these are NOT EXTRA LARGE.  Like the material. Will keep in hopes to wear once the baby weight is gone.,B0002UR7SQ

"First of all...I am tiny. 5'3 102lbs.
I bought an extra large b/c I like my warm up's really loose to accomodate flexability and comfort.
They fit too tight for my taste but, again, when I say loose..I mean LOOSE!
I cut them off to wear as shorts for the above reasons and, imo, they are too expensive to cut off.
Too, if i wanted shorts..i'd have bought the shorts.",B0002UR7SQ
My daughter was so excited to get these for her birthday. The stitching came out around the elastic at the bottoms of one pant leg less than 2 weeks of owning them and five wears. Very disappointed. Dont waist your money. Buy a better brand.,B0002UR7SQ
Great for ballet class.  Keeps me warm during my barre.,B0002UR7SQ
"Second pair for my daughter, grew out of the first.  Comfortable, keeps her wam.",B0002UR7SQ
Im 57 tall and weigh 115lbs. I ordered the extra small and they are huge on me. They look nice and are super warm so Im keeping them but I wish they were less baggy.,B0002UR7SQ
"We bought two sizes up so that they would be long enough.  She likes to roll them at the top.  Shes tall, and has had no problems with the fit",B0002UR7SQ
Good fit. does what it is supposed to.,B0002UR7SQ
"I ordered this the week of Christmas and it arrived the day after ordering when it was expected to arrive after Christmas.  Very impressed!  My daughter loves them!  She is a tall, skinny, 12 year-old and I ordered her the Adult XS.  They keep her legs warm and she uses them for her modern class.  They currently are doing a rehearsals for their spring recital and she does a lot of jumping and spinning on the floor and so far they have shown no signs of wear.",B0002UR7SQ
"My daughter's ballet teacher recommended this warm up to keep her muscles warm to and from dance and at barre. Well made, XS fit her, she's 5'5"" and 100 lbs.",B0002UR7TA
Exactly what my daughter needed for warm ups at ballet.  Ladies small fits my 11yo (she wears children's 12) with plenty of room to grow.,B0002UR7TA
Love the feel but they ripped the first time my daughter wore them for warm ups!,B0002UR7TA
My daughter is a dancer and loves these!! They are baggy which makes it easy for movement. Definitely worth the buy!!,B0002UR7TA
Got a medium for my 54 140 pound ballet dancing daughter. She said they are way too big!!! So she won't wear them. I think thats probably the style of this pant but shes from the super skinny pant generation so these pants go against everything she stands for. They are well made. No issues.,B0002UR7TA
"Fits well. I'm a medium, but ordered L",B0002UR7TA
"Gave as a gift to my 12 year old granddaughter, and she loves them.  This will be her first year of toe class, so she is super excited.",B0002UR7TA
My daughter loves these! They are comfortable and easy to move in and quickly slide on and off.  Definitely worth the purchase.,B0002UR7TA
"Great for backpacking wind pants!!!
perfect! 3.5 oz, no pockets, and cheap!",B0002UR7TA
"These are great. They do shrink after a couple of washes (I let air dry, never put in dryer)....",B0002UR7TA
So disappointed.  Granddaughter needed them for competition and they were too big.  She had to have plum and they were only available in XS.  She is 14 and hoped they would fit.  Very disappointed.,B0002UR7TA
I did not like it at all.  It's very baggy.,B0002UR7TA
"I love these pants, they are so incredibly light, but somehow quite warm. I put them on over a leo and tights and INSTANTLY feel warmth once the pants go on, as if all my body heat suddenly gets trapped inside and radiates back to me. To give you a sense of size, I'm 5'5"" 123 pounds, VERY curvy hips with smaller thighs. I got the Medium. They aren't too tight or too loose, they are exactly as I would expect them to fit, pretty much just like the picture for the product shows, which means plenty baggy and roomy but not overly so.  They go right down to my ankles, the perfect length. I can keep them unrolled at the waist and they go right up to the bottom of my breasts to keep my entire abd warm if needed, but usually I wear them rolled down to the hips. So cute.

The other day I was taking my puppy for a walk on some trails, and by the time I arrived, it was EXTREMELY gusty with a cold February wind blowing everywhere. Luckly I had these in my car and I slipped them on over my running tights, viola! I had some instant wind breaking pants on. They're not completely wind-stopping, but they definitely helped out in a pinch, without these I would have had to turn around and go home.

As for durability, I've only worn them a handful of times, but my puppy with her sharp puppy claws climbed all over me the other day while I was wearing these, and although her claws seemed to be ripping into them, they held up to the beating. So far no rips.",B0002UR7TA
These are used for backpacking in the snow.  Kept me dry and warm.,B0002UR7TA
"I ordered the medium, based on the reviews. I wanted to have room and to be a Kevin to roll the waste. 5' 5"" misses size 4. Although in the cold, these are not warm, as soon as you start to warm up, they do a great job of holding in your body heat.",B0002UR7TA
"Xmas present for 11 year old dancer.  Shes very tall, wears a 14/16, bought her the adult xs, they're perfect",B0002UR7TA
It's already stating to rip on the bottom of the leg where it tapers around the ankle.  It doesn't seem like it will be very durable.,B0002UR7TA
"I am a man, 5'9"", 160 lb., 32"" waist.  I got the medium.  It fits without restriction (but see below), and the ankle elastics keep me from walking on the cuffs.

I notice that women a lot smaller than I am are happy with the large, and I guess this is because their natural waist is higher than mine.

I bought these to put on after a ballet class to stay warm for an hour until a conditioning class at the same studio.  They hold heat while I am standing still, but air seems to flow right through them if I walk.  I had to run outside to my vehicle on a cold day, and I might as well have been outside with no pants, temperature-wise.

The conditioning class is murderously intense.  Planks, crunches, burpees, wall sits, jump rope for a long time, more crunches and planks, stretchy band upper body stuff, jump shots, mountain climbers.  It causes me to sweat.  The pants did not get hot, and they did not get overly sweaty inside.  That's fine.  I actually bought these at the studio because I forgot my regular sweat pants.

They were not restrictive exactly, but as my legs got sweaty and sticky, they occasionally caught on the fabric, which does not stretch, and there was some restriction just very occasionally as a result.  I think that if I was wearing one size larger, it might never have happened.  It doesn't happen with fleece sweat pants, because fleece sweat pants stretch.  These don't, and if they can't slide over the skin, there is the occasional restriction.

I will probably continue to use these for conditioning class, because they are not as hot as a pair of sweat pants, and because I don't like how wearing shorts results in my putting my bare sweating legs on a floor where people walk with shoes.

I will try and keep track of how many washings I get out of these before they fail.",B0002UR7TA
Great product!! I loved it and I received faster than I thought.,B0002UR7TA
"The product is great , the finished on the legs has to be reinforced ,it rips by washing. Not the waist , which is wider than the other products I know, very comfortable and it does not ripe. Please when you correct it , let me try it, I use then 4 to 5 times a week in the Zumba class. Very confortable, I gave my classmates the etiquette to order.",B0002UR7TA
it fits really well! I am 5'5 and have s,B0002UR7TA
These work and haven't ripped yet. I'm 135 lbs. and 5'3 and I chose medium. They sit high on my waist with a medium so if u want them to be more baggy choose a bigger size. I use them in the sauna or to work out at home and they get me sweating exactly where I want it which is my waist and legs. They haven't ripped yet and other sauna pants rip as soon as u try to work out in them,B0002UR7TA
Most other Body Wrappers stuff in XL fits me fine.  These were a bit snug.,B0002UR7TA

The elastic allows you to wear them as pants or shorts and they're really warm and durable. Perfect for warming up at the barre.,B0002UR7TA
"this is really comfortable!!! i't's really thin, so it doesn't sofocate after warm up.
My hips are kinda large (39 inches), and I purchased an M, fits great!!!!!",B0002UR7TA
"I bought 2 pairs of these (in different sizes,maybe medium and large,the print on the tags washed out so I'm not sure),years ago,directly from the Dance Distributors catalog. I still have them. They look like new and I get plenty of wear out of them. I also worked out in them and I would say that if you plan to do that,buy a roomy size or compensate by not stressing the middle seam(like if your exercises or activities involve spreading your feet wide apart...the smaller size I got developed a little split on the seam that was small and easy to sew back up). Beyond that,they're like summer weight sweat pants(in that they look like sweat pants but are very lightweight and comfortable in summer weather),they're slippery so you can slip other pants or sweat pants over them if you're going to the gym or just leaving the house and would rather be dressed in more street-type clothes while you're doing shopping or whatever...I like these and got another pair recently from amazon. Plus they're black/black and stay that way(not double-dyed black but definitely as black as a black car is(what I mean is,because they're rip-stop nylon,they don't fade at all with normal washing). These are very comfortable and baggy.",B0002UR7TA

Fit my 5'6' slender wife nicely with some room. Logo is nicely printed. Quality of shirt is good. Very pleased,B0002V60YW
"Old school classic logo yes, supporting a awesome product, but you would have expected a updated feel for the cotton T. Thick, heavy, and rather like something from the 70's. Their drums have style, quality, and superior innovation; lets see some of that in the branded materials.",B0002V60YW
The screen print of the logo was not at all the quality I was looking for. Image is blurry and the quality and size of the shirt is not as expected either.,B0002V60YW
Shirt was way to small and very thin fabric,B0002V60YW
It's made with very cheap cotton so feels terrible and looks imitation than the original 'Pearl t shirt'. I had an original one before(so I can tell the difference) but was too old so I thought this was from Pearl company...:( I just had to donate this one right away because it smelled bad when I got it so I washed it and the shape twisted very bad..just don't buy it.,B0002V60YW

"Didn't even want to give it a star but had to, to leave this comment. Do NOT expect the shirt on the picture. I just got mine today and the words are faded. The back of the shirt  DOESN'T even have the quote on the back. HORRIBLE! Didn't even know it was coming from china.",B0002V60YW
This is a fake poorly produced Chinese bootleg...,B0002V60YW
Shirt is fake. Do not buy this. Really low quality in every aspect.,B0002V60YW

"I don't understand the positive reviews on this shirt - the one I got has a terribly low-res screen-grabbed logo that looks awful - edges of the lettering are fuzzy, and the logo is even cut off on the far right (and no registered trademark symbol as shown in the pic, either - maybe they didn't want to push their luck). Lettering on the back is even worse. Also, the shirt itself is very thin, lightweight cotton, not the heavy cotton described in many reviews.  I wish Amazon had a way of filtering out bad bootleg product like this and prevent it from being sold here, or at the very least, noting the products that ARE officially licenced. Beyond annoyed.  }:-(",B0002V60YW

I'm in love with this shirt. fits me well also the material is very soft and resistant. Glad that I bought it,B0002V9IQY
"I bought an XL, but it now fits like a medium!  Im not getting FATTER, it's the shirt shrinking! It was great for about a year, but after a while it just doesn't fit the same way. If I were you, I would buy this shirt a few sizes larger than you want, and expect it to shrink in the wash!

My husband is an ex-marine & we gor this shirt for our grandson....he wears it all the time......,B0002V9IQY
I've had for a few weeks and worn it during numerous PT sessions. It can take a lot of wear and still come out looking great after a wash. The fabric is tight but stretchy and is a little itchy before the first wash. Looks great.,B0002V9J0Y
no problem recieving my order. I would feel safe buying from them again. The quality of the shirt was good too.,B0002V9J0Y
"Got it for my husband. He was in the Marines and he talked about how the men at the gym sport the branched they served (he had to show off, and what better way than to get a snug fitting Marine PT shirt lol). He was pleased even more that I bought 2! Great buy! Arrived in 3 days. Measure yourself and make sure to go with the size chart for best fit.",B0002V9J0Y
I love all the Rothco products I've purchased. Great quality and fit!,B0002V9J0Y
To whom it may concern this is a great product it fits right it's comfortable too wear maybe I should have gotten an Xtra large vs 2x's so I'll probably be ordering a couple more.thanks.,B0002V9J0Y
The logo is too high on the shirt. Otherwise a very soft and nice product.,B0002V9J0Y
"Comfortable, but a little too big. That's my fault, not the manufacturer.",B0002V9J0Y
I wish I would have ordered the large.,B0002V9J0Y

"Sleeve was torn very small, being a Marine for 20 years it's not a big deal using it to work out so will stitch it and go on, but may want to check for other customers, I do like the material if you have other ones in that material I would like to have link for them.",B0002V9J0Y
Very soft shirt that fits well.  Price was very far for product.,B0002V9J0Y
"This product is not what i ordered, it is not a med size. I am very disappointed in this product.",B0002V9J0Y
"Nice shirt,  runs small. Brings back memories of the old days.  Nothing special other than the marines reference on the front.",B0002V9J0Y
Comfortable and actually fits after being washed. I would recommend this company and their shirts over many others who can't make t-shirts like this one.,B0002V9J0Y
This shirt is very soft and a large fits my long torso. I also appreciate that the neck isn't lose.,B0002V9J0Y
"I like the fact that saids Marines but also like how confortable this shirt can be, i think this shirt can be a great gift for any guy that joint or instreted in the Marines.",B0002V9J0Y
way to small for being a large. Maybe I got a kids shirt be accident. It arrived in a few days that was great. but they shld be better at size portions,B0002V9J0Y

Decent material. Officially licensed by the USMC. Fit as expected. Made in Honduras. Can't complain.,B0002V9J0Y
"This shirt did not really fit right. Was a bit too small considering similar (army, navy, etc) shirts of same size. Not sure what the deal was.",B0002V9J0Y
As far as I know this tactical turtleneck was good. I sent it to a buddy as a joke.. I told him he cannot get into any gunfights or infiltrate high security areas with out it. This was the slightly darker black version.,B0002V9KCQ
It`s too cool . I love it.l`m going to make other orders with your site . Thanks a lot .,B0002V9KCQ
"My husband has ordered 4 of these shirts so far.  They wash beautifully, hold their color (cold water) and dry wrinkle-free mostly.  He wears them for casual but also under a sports coat and it looks fine.  A good buy",B0002V9KCQ
"I have purchased many different mock turtlenecks thru Amazon and the Rothco is by far my favorite. Great fit, feel, construction and fabric. It has laundered very well. The 5% spandex in the collar and cuffs makes the garment look sharp and really helps keep out the cold. I'm so pleased with this shirt that I ordered another in a different color, and I'll be looking for a short sleeve version.",B0002V9KCQ
Cant beat the price. No shrinking!,B0002V9KCQ
"This is a no nonsense man shirt. Beefy material great fit great stiching.  Priced right.  I will buy more

Fit great when I put it on and then lost a full size the first time I washed it.  I would not recommend.,B0002V9KCQ
"Shirt fits fine, slightly tight on the wrist, so pushing up to check the time on my watch is not a simple task, but not terrible.  Only real complaint is the neck. After 4 or so washes it has lost its elasticity and looks like the old ""bacon neck"".  Other brand I have (I won't mention the name), is several years old, and the Turtleneck has held up perfectly.",B0002V9KCQ
"The shirt is great quality, but its sized like 1980. Definitely not slim fit, very loose. Except for the neck. I purchased the medium and I have a 15 neck. Unwashed, my head barely fit through the neck and it fit tight. I had flashbacks to the day of my birth, it was so tight on my head. Once I got my head through, I felt like I was being manhandled by the Boston Strangler! Good luck taking it off.... took a twenty mule team and I had to tie myself to a 100 year old oak tree. Breech birth city. Needless to say my girlfriend now owns the shirt!",B0002V9KCQ

"A couple of the nine shirts I bought had pinholes (a little less than the diameter of a Tic-Tac mint) in them after one washing. But I will return them and replace them with the same shirts as they are otherwise high quality (thick fabric, solid stitching, tight collar) and very comfortable. I am only 5'8"" and about 180 pounds. I bought XL, laundered hot and dried on hot, and they shrunk down to a perfect fit.",B0002V9KCQ
"Not quite the equal of the discontinued Carhartt mock turtleneck, but not bad, without having to qualify that with ""for the price,"" which is great, and better than anything short of the Carhartt that I have found--the neck is not quite as comfortable and it is somewhat lighter weight.  I normally go with large, but the xl fits well.",B0002V9KCQ
"Very nice shirt(s) at a fair price.  I'm 5'9"" / 180# and I'd say they are generously apportioned and of decent quality.
They are not cheesy light weight, but not extremely heavy either.
They are what I wanted/expected.  I'd buy them again.",B0002V9KCQ
arms were too long but the rest of the shirt was short,B0002V9KCQ
This is now favorite garment for cool weather layering.,B0002V9KCQ
"Good fitting turtle neck for a good price. Bought a large for a cosplay costume, works great and looks cool.",B0002V9KCQ
"There are inconsistent reports on whether these run true to size. The size small that I got is rather tight. I guess it could be called a true small if it is intended to be a tight fit. The arms, though, are unusually short for a small, so I think it would be more realistic to call it an extra-small. The material and stitching seem good, so I would call it a good buy if you can get one that fits properly. The color is a solid black, not a dark gray as some have reported.",B0002V9KCQ
"Fit fine, I ordered LG as are all my shirts. No shrinkage after two washes.",B0002V9KCQ
Should be a bit tighter at the neck,B0002V9KCQ
"Good thick shirt, long in the sleeves, everything I like, just a little on the rough side",B0002V9KCQ
"very nice shirt. warm thick cotton, not thick like a sweatshirt but heavier than a t-shirt. the body is full 100% cotton, the cuffs and neck are 5% spandex. since it's cotton it shrinks in the dryer. if in doubt, err on the large side. i'm a very skinny guy - 5'9'', 125 lbs. i bought a medium, washed it, threw it in the dryer on high heat, and it fits me perfectly. a little long, but if you tuck it in no problem. the small would have been very tight, which i didn't want, as it's just a shirt to lounge around and relax in. now that i know how the size fits, i'm buying a few more.",B0002V9KCQ
Very good quality very comfortable,B0002V9KCQ
Comfortable and good looking at a good price.,B0002V9KCQ
"Good shirt, shrunk quite a bit upon washing and drying but nothing unusual for 100% cotton.

I'm 5'8"" 185 pounds and a large is just right. If you have long arms this may be a little short in the arm length for you.

This is not a high end shirt, it can be worn with jeans or causal attire.

I will buy a few more of these shirts.",B0002V9KCQ
Fits well.  A little snug around the collar.,B0002V9KCQ
"Im 510, 185 pounds with a muscle build and a large fits perfectly. Its not made out of any special, high tech material but it is well made and looks great.",B0002V9KCQ
I love this shirt.  Its exactly what I wanted.  It is soft and comfortable and fits well.,B0002V9KCQ
"Fits as expected. I'm 5'7"", 178 lbs. with a stocky build and the shirt fits perfectly.",B0002V9KCQ
"Good material, size was correct.",B0002V9KCQ
Cheap--looks cheap...guess i got what I paid for...,B0002V9KCQ
material is cheap and will not hold up.  Was looking for something much closer to Blauer or elbeco type quality. Not bad for layering however.,B0002V9KCQ
Great shirt - comfortable and fits perfectly.  I wanted this for a Steve Jobs costume.  But I'll probably wear it regularly (and get weird looks - as I'm told I do look a lot like Mr. Jobs).,B0002V9KCQ
"This is what I was looking for. It's a little loose and the arms are kind of fat, but overall it is a good mock turtleneck.",B0002V9KCQ
"Nice fabric, well made and fits perfectly.",B0002V9KCQ
"great so far, warm, and wanted tight neck, so far so good",B0002V9KCQ
"Nice shirt, feels great. Im a no neck and this covers all of my neck.",B0002V9KCQ
Good construction. Comfortable. Mid-weight. Should work well for Arizona winters.,B0002V9KCQ
Good enough for the price but quality of fabric could have been better...softer.,B0002V9KCQ
"Arrived quickly packed securely very pleased with the order to received process.  The shirt is thick and very comfortable.  The mock collar is sturdy and tight so I expect it will keep its shape and not stretch with wear.  I ride my Harley a lot even in the cool Michigan climate, 38 degrees is my cutoff temperature and I feel like this shirt will be a bonus when I layer up for my rides.  I feel confident in recommending it, I have washed and dried it, it did not shrink on medium no wrinkle heat selection.  I had ordered a mock neck shirt with the POLICE embroidery from different seller on Amazon it's a pretty sad looking shirt, I wish this mock came with embroidery options, it would be a good Police under uniform shirt.",B0002V9KCQ
Thick Winter weight shirt.  Not the vantablack color I was hoping for but its a warm turtleneck.,B0002V9KCQ
"Good heavy cotton material. Fits a little more closely than I'd like but that's because I'm a lardbutt. Length is good. My only concern is that the collar and cuffs may stretch out, since there's no spandex, but so far so good. Might order a size up next time, though, or else lose some weight :)",B0002V9KCQ
Good price. The shirt is very loose and large for a small.,B0002V9KCQ
Fit my son perfectly. He wore it under a unite jacket for prom.,B0002V9KCQ
A perfect fit.  I will buy this again.,B0002V9KCQ
"after washing several times, the product holds up well.  I would buy another because it is a good value.",B0002V9KCQ
"Fairly thick, fits well, good quality. If anything it's a tad big but I bought it a size under. Very happy",B0002V9KCQ
"Arrived on time, nice fit, loved the thick fabric. Dark black. Ad did not say 'mock' turtle neck so expected standard turtle neck but this was just right as a mock turtleneck.",B0002V9KCQ
"Wrong product received.

First I received the item as advertised, a Rothco Mock turtleneck,

Second time I order I get a cheaper shirt in the mail, brand name ""Allegra-K"". Style and quality were severely lacking and were not even remotely similar, felt like a cheap Chinese shirt.

I was pretty dissatisfied with the reorder process and am worried that if I reorder again they may give me the wrong product again.",B0002V9KCQ
Fits well. time will tell if the garment will hold up. Good price.,B0002V9KCQ
Fulfilled my desires and expections.,B0002V9KCQ
"Very nice shirt. I am very happy with the shirt. It fits well is made of good quality cotton, is quite thick , And keeps its size and shape in the wash.",B0002V9KCQ
Decent quality that compares to Blauer and 5'11 tac. Wish the material was a little softer.,B0002V9KCQ
"Received it last week wore it once, washed it and noticed two holes in the fabric.
Sleeves seem a little short, but I could live with that because that works out well if you dressed in layers, and work outside like I do.
Don't waste your money.",B0002V9KCQ
Would have given 5 stars but the collar tends to roll.,B0002V9KCQ
So far after 1 wash this thing fit about perfect.  I'm 5'7 medium build.  I wear this under other shirts at work and it isn't too thick.  I'll order again,B0002V9KCQ
Perfect fit planning on getting more,B0002V9KCQ
Exactly what I wanted. Good value for the money.,B0002V9KCQ
Perfect fit and function. Looks good. The lower turtle neck is nice an added layer of warmth without having to go with a full turtle neck. Decent quality for the money.,B0002V9KCQ
"Excellent fabric and fit - more modern, slim fit than traditional potato bag turtlenecks.",B0002V9KCQ
"Good quality, fits well, and retains its shape.  would like to have this shirt in different colors, but I guess for a ""uniform"" shirt black and navy are the proper colors.",B0002V9KCQ
"Nice shirt, good cotton feel that I like, neck fits snug but I wear 17 1/2 in shirt size. Washed twice in hot water and no shrinking to speak of.",B0002V9KCQ
Cold weather must. Fits good made tough and keeps me warm.,B0002V9KCQ
Great fit. Love the 100% cotton. Great as a layer or on its own.,B0002V9KCQ
Looks great under a sport coat or vest.,B0002V9KCQ
I wear a size small but it runs small.,B0002V9KCQ
An excellent mock turtle neck. Very comfortable and looks great.,B0002V9KCQ
Very comfortable.  Fit as expected.,B0002V9KCQ
Use it for skiing and love it. Size runs a little small. Usually wear and XL and the 2XL fits perfect. Not too thin and not too thick. Washed a few times now and no shrinkage or loss of color.,B0002V9KCQ
"Nice enough shirt, holding up fine after several washings",B0002V9KCQ
"This is a VERY GOOD quality mock turtle.  I am 6'1"", 235 lbs., and a XXL fits me perfect!  I'm ordering a navy one today.",B0002V9KCQ
"I'm 5'8"" with a 43"" chest, 32/33 arm and 16.5"" neck and 170 pounds.  The large fit perfectly.  Loose enough to be comfortable but not baggy.  Nice and soft.  I bought this one and a Redkap large.  The Redkap arms were marginally short and the feel of the material not nearly so soft.  this shirt fits great, looks great and the black is black and not washed out.  The neck is snug enough but not tight.  I will buy more.",B0002V9KCQ
"Excellent quality, super comfortable, true to size. I'm 6'2"", 215, broad shoulders. A large fits perfect. Not too tight, perfect length. Keeps form after multiple washes. Warm and soft. Buying many more. Could use more colors to choose from",B0002V9KCQ
It is a comfortable fitting mock turtle shirt. Well worth the money!,B0002V9KCQ
I bought 2 of these shirts for my picky adult son and he loves them. I ordered the blue from one seller and went back to order the black that was only available from a different seller and cheaper. These are the perfect weight and true to color.  I washed the blue shirt and dried it on low in the event it might shrink.  It did not so I expect the black will not also.  Good buy at a reasonable price not to mention what appears to be very good quality. Go for it.,B0002V9KCQ
"Not as fit as in the picture. Otherwise, good material, solid color. The collar is not choking",B0002V9KCQ
Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He was very pleased with the quality & comfort of the shirt. He wants me to order another one !!,B0002V9KCQ
Initial fit is good. May follow IPA free a few washes to let you know if it shrinks much.,B0002V9KCQ
"For a 2XL the body is almost tight, the neck tight and length is too short.
I'm a normal XL, but buy 2XL for length and shrinkage.
This one doesn't come close .
Suggest you look for a different company.",B0002V9KCQ
EVERY THING WENT AS PROMISED  GOOD BUY,B0002V9KCQ
"I am 5'8"" and weigh 155; that's pretty trim. The medium size of this shirt fit me tightly before washing and was too small after washing only once in warm water. Otherwise the quality is above average, a soft cotton material of medium weight. Buy a size larger than what you'd expect and you should be all right. After one washing, the large size of this product fits me comfortably.",B0002V9KCQ
"Very poor quality cotton, it feels rough and it scratches me.",B0002V9KCQ
Excellent product. The shirt fits just as expected and the collar does not sag--(I hate it when the collar sags).  I'll be back for more!,B0002V9KCQ
All that I was hoping for. My husband loves it!,B0002V9KCQ
"Bought for my husband, heavy cotton, warm and good quality!",B0002V9KCQ
Very nice shirt. The collar is the perfect height and size. The best Mock I have found!,B0002V9KCQ
"Excellent mock neck, husband wears over base layer and under top layer. Loves. Will not pay all that money for other competitor  when this is just as nice!",B0002V9KCQ
"Feels well made. This product was made in Bangladesh. Original advertisement sound like it was made in America. That said, it's overpriced.",B0002V9KCQ
I brought this turtleneck for my husband and he loves how it fits.,B0002V9KCQ
good quality - good fit - nice long tail,B0002V9KCQ
"This is a shirt, I ordered it as a work shirt but it's a little too nice to wear as a work shirt so I wear it as a causual dress shirt.",B0002V9KCQ
bought these in large hoping that they would shrink a little when washed which they did.wore one last night and it felt good I like my shirts tight around the neck and this shirt was excactly what i hoped for.,B0002V9KCQ
"So far so good. Haven't washed it yet. Will see how neck and sleeve cuffs hold up. Hard to find one where neck doesn't stretch out at a year w/o paying $40 for one, or the Anvil ones that are no longer available. They were the best.",B0002V9KCQ
"IS WHAT IT IS,REPRESENTED WELL,NICE MATERIAL,NICE FIT, THANKS",B0002V9KCQ
Have several.  Best fit.  Last a long time.,B0002V9KCQ
Received with dried [what looked to be] bodily fluids - disgusting!,B0002V9KCQ
"Nice shirt, comfortable & fits to size",B0002V9KCQ
Fairly well made for the money. I'm going to purchase a couple more.,B0002V9KCQ
"If you want something cheap to work in, this is alright. The shorter sleeves will stay out of your way.  If you want something nice, try finding something else.",B0002V9KCQ
"Perfect fit, neck stays in place, and wears well. After 6 washes, it's a go to piece. Buying more",B0002V9KCQ
"I was a little worried about what another reviewer said about the color. I ordered one to get a look for myself.  I'm glad I did! I ordered several more.  I almost passed this by because of a few somewhat negative reviews. I have been wearing Carhardt mocks for a long time, and I was looking for an alternative.  I like these a lot more!  Great shirt!",B0002V9KCQ
"Heavy duty, comfortable and durable.",B0002V9KCQ
I liked the design of the collar of this shirt. It protected my neck without being uncomfortable.,B0002V9KCQ
i use it for work very comfy and warm enough. size is accurate .,B0002V9KCQ
"The shirts fit well, but faded a bit when I washed them.",B0002V9KCQ
"Fit & finish/color was perfect on this shirt. The mock neck is double thick and is holding up well in the wash/dryer. Large very slightly shrunk during first wash cycle...fit is perfect now. This shirt is perfect under a long sleeve uniform for cold weather. I'm 5'7, 185, size large worked well. At this price will definitely purchase again.",B0002V9KCQ
color could be a little stiffer. I expect is to stretch after washingr,B0002V9KCQ
Thick soft material.  Sleeves and neck fit well. If you wear XL than get XL.,B0002V9KCQ
great to cover up an older turkey skin neck,B0002V9KCQ
Well made and soft for a great price.,B0002V9KCQ
"I'm buying another 3-4 next winter!  these are great!  (not sure how long they hold up, being I just got them last month, but for FIT, COMFORT and WARMTH, I love these!",B0002V9KCQ
"I have purchased this style product from several other sources (LL Bean, Eddie Bower, etc.) and this product I like the best. Fits better, collar holds its shape and the color does not fade to a black/grey color!",B0002V9KCQ
Great shirt. the neck fit was perfect - no sagging or loose around the throat area. Sophisticated and dashing.,B0002V9KCQ
"My old Devon Jones Mock Turtles were very comfortable but have stretched out at the neck so they are not really useful for public wear. So I purchased one each of three different shirts and this Rothco wins the prize for reorders. I love the neck and cuffs that besides having a Lycra content for body also are a two layer design to help with the body. They are not just a heavier knit as the seam that sizes the neck and cuff goes from the outside to inside, actually folded over. The 100% cotton is extremely comfortable. I have no idea why this shirt would help law enforcement but I highly recommend this shirt for everyone else.",B0002V9KCQ
"Gift for Father-in-law. Not as nicely made as the Pendleton, but serviceable.",B0002V9KCQ
my husband loves it and if it came in more colors i would get more,B0002V9KCQ
Very good quality and holds its shape at the neck. I'm a police officer and I hate cheaper t necks that look loose after you pull them over your head.,B0002V9KCQ
seems to be of good quality.  I wish it came in white,B0002V9KCQ
"Tactical Turtleneck! Archer, Bond, it's how it's done.",B0002V9KCQ
For the price a good value. Fit was  spot on.,B0002V9KCQ
Excellent mock turtleneck for the price! I have paid much more for a lot less. The collar does not sag after repeated washings. Great value!!,B0002V9KCQ
Cut a little large in the upper shoulder/chest area. Haven't had this problem before so I don't think it's me. May shrink some in wash and tighten up in these areas. Otherwise made OK,B0002V9KCQ
Nicely made and fit's very well.,B0002V9KCQ
"great shirt, well made -- you won't be sorry",B0002V9KCQ
Sizing was accurate & weight just about right.,B0002V9KCQ
Nice shirt and comfortable fit but the sleeves are two inches short. I'm a tall guy and if there was a tall version of the shirt that would be great.,B0002V9KCQ
"Very happy with it, thank you for asking.",B0002V9KCQ
Great value. Could not be happier.,B0002V9KCQ
Well constructed.  Great fit.  Sleeves nice and long and snug at cuff.  Washes well with no shrinkage. Neck stays snug.  Have bought a number of different mock turtleneck shirts trying to find the right one and THIS IS IT - Just bought 2 more!,B0002V9KCQ
Great product.  Soft and heavy weight.  I bought 3 more of these.,B0002V9KCQ
not black after a washing not put in dryer,B0002V9KCQ
Great Fit which is well made and warm without being too hot.  Perfect!,B0002V9KCQ
Fit as expected. The quality of the fabric is not perfect but looks quite nice.,B0002V9KCQ
"People write about the thickness of fabric. Not mine. It was closer to a pretty thin t-shirt. And ill fitting to boot. I ordered an extra large, which I typically do, but this was shapeless and a bad fit. Ok, maybe it's just me, but this turtle neck didn't meet my expectations and I'm returning it.",B0002V9KCQ
"Great mock turtleneck! For the money, this one can't be beat. It's ""comfortable"" look is great for a relaxed/casual look around town. It's pretty thick, thicker then a tee shirt, nice black color, and the sleeves and neck are great. I am 5'8 160# with a 41"" chest and it's a tad big, but after a wash and dry, it's pretty close to perfect...allot like the polo shirts I wear, loose, but not overly large. I have ordered 3 I like them so much. I may try a medium, but fear it would be too small.",B0002V9KCQ
needed this for a costume party. My wife went as an iPhone 6. I looked everywhere for a black mock turtleneck. Nobody sells them anymore. But you can find anything on Amazon. So the Steve Jobs costume was complete.,B0002V9KCQ
"After reading the reviews I decided to order a large, even though I am a solid medium. 5 foot 11 165 pounds. I'm happy to report the large fits exactly the way I like to wear a sweater. Not skin tight but still tailored. The mock turtleneck I received was definitely a true black. Very happy and ordering a second one.",B0002V9KCQ
"Shorter people might like these, but I find them boxy with quite short sleeves. I much prefer Land's End mock T's.",B0002V9KCQ
Very nice comfortable material.  This shirt fits as EXPECTED!,B0002V9KCQ
Couldn't find these in any dept. store around me.  I'm thin blooded and like my neck warm in the cold.  These fit the bill and look good even with a suit coat.,B0002V9KCQ
"I normally wear shirts in Large size, but after reading comments I ordered the X Large mock turtleneck. It fits me perfectly (especially after a wash and dry). This shirt is very comfortable, the mock neck collar is soft but stays snug. I recently wore it on a 15 hour flight without any issues. The sleeve cuffs also are snug without being tight, the edges don't roll up. All in all, a great product.",B0002V9KCQ
"This is a heavy turtleneck. Pardon, tactleneck. It's nice and warm, retains its color nicely, and is very, very well made. I need to get more of these.",B0002V9KCQ
"Just received 2 of these color is black,fits great,nice heavy material! I wear these under work and fishing clothes, they should work fine!",B0002V9KCQ
I am a police officer and It fits great under my uniform! Great buy for your money!,B0002V9KCQ
"I received the Mock T on time as promised.  I eagerly opened the box and pulled out a very black garment.  Someone who was reviewing this said it was pre-faded.  I didn't find that to be the case.
Attached to the collar was an American flag, you know...attached with those annoying nylon strings that make your teeth work extra hard to cut through.  Why use scissors when you have teeth?  Anyhow, I thought with the American flag attached, this garment must have been made in America by hard working Americans, doing their best to make a living.
Well, I read the ingredients the garment was made out of on the tag...100% cotton, and at the very bottom of the tag, the words, ""Made in Pakistan.""
There went my patriotic feelings.
But the Mock T still looks nice.",B0002V9KCQ
I have ordered Large and have received X-Large,B0002V9KCQ
This shirt fits perfectly and is black not gray.,B0002V9KCQ
I know ordering a clothing item on line can be a hit or miss but I ordered this black turtle neck because I could not find them in the stores and took a chance on the medium.  Depending on the manufacture I take a Large or Medium.  I ordered a Medium and it fit just perfect.  Material is not too bad also.  I am happy with the Quality,B0002V9KCQ
"The mock was made from good materials and looked quality, just too big to be classified as an XL",B0002V9KCQ
"Good fit, heavy material. So far,  so good.",B0002V9KCQ
"On a cool fall day,  you can't go wrong with the mock turtleneck. Looks great. Fits great.",B0002V9KCQ
"Fits as expected,  comfortable,  excellent shirt.",B0002V9KCQ
"I am NOT a fan of the Rothco brand. In fact, I hate most of their stuff - so I was amazed at how great this shirt is. It fits true to size and holds up well in the wash without shrinking much. The material is extremely comfortable. I actually prefer this shirt to the much more expensive one by Carhartt. I'll definitely be ordering a couple extras.
P.S. I am 5ft. 11in. tall, and weigh about 150 pounds. The large fits me perfectly.",B0002V9KCQ
I chose this rating because it looks nice and is very comfortable.  I would recommend it to a friend,B0002V9KCQ
The color was very rich and the material is wonderful and fit very well I have already ordered 8 more.,B0002V9KCQ
"this is a good, heavy turtleneck that i am sure will last me for years. nice quality material, warm for the winter, heavy duty construction that can surely withstand lots and lots of wear.

two things, though:

1) whats with the pre-faded look? this is definitely not a true black color. the color looks like that of a black t-shirt thats been through the washer & dryer about 75 times. wish it were darker.

2) i love how this is a military and law enforcement supply company with an american flag on the logo, but the shirt itself is made in pakistan...

anyhow. good heavy-duty turtleneck and the sizing is accurate.",B0002V9KCQ
"After 1 year usage, neck part has torn also stretched, this is not exactly what law enforcement wears! just a poor quality product, I wouldn't recommend.",B0002V9KCQ
"I've only worn it a couple of times, but so far  I like. A little stretchy  and form fitting  Seems like it will be hold up well.  A large fits me the way I prefer, I'm 5'9"" , 170 lbs 42"" short suite coat.",B0002V9KCQ
Excellent quality turtleneck.  Thick cotton and the neck does not lose its elasticity.  Keeps you warm but doesn't restrict movement.,B0002V9KCQ
"It is what I wanted and better than my expextation.
it is fit well to me and has nice color.",B0002V9KCQ
"Very nice material,good generous fit,looks like  it will last for a while,Good pricing,will buy again,hope they make more color choices,right now I can only find color black.",B0002V9KCQ
I buy this type of shirt online because no one in my city sells turtle necks.  I use them as a layer of added warmth in the winter.  I wear either a xxl or xxxl depending on the type of shirt.  xxxl shirts are usually loose.  This shirt fits like a xxl in other shirts of this type.  I can still wear it but prefer long sleeves a bit looser.  The material quality and construction are good and the color is a rich black color.,B0002V9KCQ
the collar rolls down in the front but this might be due to working in an office and looking down allot. However the shirt is fitting fine.,B0002V9KCQ
very versatile and comfortable. I have many shirts to wear over it but also looks great on its own. I have washed it once and collar kept its shape very well.,B0002V9KCQ
"When did grey become the new black?  I dont' understand why a ""black"" shirt comes as if it's been pre-faded.....thicker and heavier than most so pretty good quality shirt...if I liked the color it'd get a 5.  The fit is a fair bit tighter than most.",B0002V9KCQ
Fits well and looks good.  Only after a few washes can I tell if it's going to be a 5 star.,B0002V9KCQ
"The size was correct, the color is perfect and the quality is great.  I am glad I made the purchase.",B0002V9KCQ
"I like this shirt, but it's more t-shirt material than knit style and weight.
Not very dark black, just medium black.
Made in Pakistan.

Nothing like a more expensive TriMountain 100% cotton, but about half the price.

Runs small; I usually wear a L, would need an XL after I washed it, although it might not
tend to shrink up in length like the knit cotton shirts do (like 3 inches, but I'm not tall, so that suits me
since I tend to wear them out, not tucked in).

Neck will hold it's shape, and I like it way better than the shirts I got from Kmart or Khols, which I returned.
Looks like I'm in between sizes on this Rothco, so I'm returning it. If you are slim, then it might fit you,
or order a size larger.

I'm afraid this style cotton cloth won't shrink like the knit shirts (which tend to run big until washed)
so I'm going to pass on ordering an XL.",B0002V9KCQ
"Wear this Item often...feels good under uniform without the bulk...feels good on the skin also, not restricting...",B0002V9KCQ
"Decently made but not particularly soft or thicker material I was hoping it to be after reading other reviews. It's not necessarily thin, but I would not consider it on of the warmer side of (mock) turtle necks I own. I would also add that is not necessarily a ""dressy"" type shirt, particularly after a wash or two. Seems like it would hold up well as a work shirt though.",B0002V9KCQ
The size was way too small. It barely comes down to my belt line and is too tight for a large. Order up a size.,B0002V9KCQ
"Light, tight, right fit. Fabric is sports coat worthy business casual.",B0002V9KCQ
Only had for about 2 months. Seem durable and like how the neck fits and looks clean. One thing to note the sleeves seem to be a little short overall. I actually don't mind that so they don't punch up under the cuffs. Just be aware.,B0002V9KCQ
Shrunk after the first wash. Can't wear it,B0002V9KCQ
"high quality cotton, perfect fit ... I bought a second after receiving and liking the first",B0002V9KCQ
"Decent shirt but way small. I am an XL tall, at 6'4"" and 220 lbs., I am a big guy but not that big. So I ordered 2XL figuring that would do it. Not even close. It is skin tight and hard to get into. It sits on the shelf and I am still wearing the old mock turtleneck I wanted to replace.",B0002V9KCQ
"Definitely worth the money. A little tight, but my head is bigger than average",B0002V9KK8
"I am not sure what the size issues were for the other people who purchased this hat.  I went out on a limb and purchased two of them - one for someone with a large head and the other person with an XL (7-7/8) hat size.  They both LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them and both tell me that the hat fits well.  The only negative comment was it's a little itchy because it is wool, but not enough to stop that person from loving it and wearing it immediately!  You will have massive amounts of static and ""hat hair"", but then there isn't a wool beanie out there that won't do that to you!",B0002V9KK8
"ordered grey and got a green  one,,will not go thru hassle of returning will give to my dog to chew up..ordered for my son will NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN~~~",B0002V9KK8
"The hat was a gift for our son.  He says, ""Great hat: warm, light comfortable, stuffable!""  It is warm, and he looks good in it.  Great for camping and biking on chilly days... or riding in a jeep.",B0002V9KK8
"I live in AU and I'm a MASH fan from way back. So I bought one of these for myself and another for my son. I have a big head so mine borders on being too tight.  The plastic peak almost cuts into my forehead...  But not quite.  It's actually not uncomfortable though just very snug.  My son is only seven,  his almost digs into his head as well.  It would be good if these can be bought in a larger size as well but all in All I'm very happy with the quality. Very warm.  Very snug.  Great quality.",B0002V9KK8
"I always wanted to look like Radar from M*A*S*H, so I bought this hat.

Just kidding. That dude isn't handsome.

His hat, on the other hand...

For this price, the quality can't be beat. I've worn it every day since I've bought it a few months ago and it still looks and fits like it is brand new.

The fact that it's 100% wool was what sold me.

I own a 2011 JK, so for those cool summer nights with the top down, this works perfect.

If you're way into M*A*S*H or just want a fashionable, warm hat, do yourself a solid and pick this one up; you won't regret it.",B0002V9KK8
A little small for my head but does the trick.,B0002V9KK8
"I bought 4 totally satisfied,  looks like mil spec to me!",B0002V9KK8
Nice cap for the money.  I can't use it because it is way to small for an adult. In fact if is too tight for my 3 year old and 6 year old grandsons. Not worth the trouble to return.,B0002V9KK8
Hat is too smal  Size was unclear,B0002V9KK8
The Green color is much better than I thought.  Fit's well and quality is very good. Maybe a simple note of if there is color choice or not would be a good thing,B0002V9KK8
"I bought this for my husband who has always wanted a Radar O'Reilly hat! He loves it. It fits him just perfect, with a little wiggle room, so not tight. It is well made. His hat size is 7 1/4, if that helps. This looks so great on him! He said it is perfect when he is working out in the cold. He can pull it over his ears to protect them from the cold, and it covers his ears entirely. He said it is nice and thick. So we highly recommend this cap. Also note the seller ships super fast.",B0002V9KK8
"Not for people with larger heads (L/XL). The plastic in the visor ends up pressing on the forehead. Had to return it. The color was army green, darker than pictured.",B0002V9KK8
I lovedthis hat  it was a little tight when I got it but after using it for a bit it stretched out I love it. It's nice and warm.,B0002V9KK8
Perfect.  Just in time for winter!,B0002V9KK8
"The cap looks nice...I haven't given it as a gift.  The amazon photo is misleading.  It appears like you get 2 caps, both dark grey and green for that price (which would be amazing), but, I was never prompted to choose a color",B0002V9KK8
Fits well. Keeps me head warm. Satisfied.,B0002V9KK8
"Well priced, good quality, great look.
And it's warm too!",B0002V9KK8
Was looking for a wool hat. This is a good one.,B0002V9KK8
"It's nice,its good quality,it's olive green,I look like radar Buy it ",B0002V9KK8
"Fits snug, especially after 1st washing. Which is good. Just right for dry, still, chilly spring mornings. Keeps a bald head warm unless the wind is really blowing. Just like G.I. issue, with a non-cardboard brim insert.",B0002V9KK8
Excellent product recommend it ,B0002V9KK8
Appears to be good quality.  Size quite small.  Way too tight for my GI noggin!,B0002V9KK8
"Not a real thick or tightly woven wool but does keep ones head warm. It is a pretty tight fits, so if your hats size is 7 1/2 or greater the cap may be too small.",B0002V9KK8
"Arrived extremely fast. 100% wool, made in USA.",B0002V9KK8
"Intended to upgrade a rayon jeep cap, these are junk.",B0002V9KK8
A little snug but stretchable. i'm 7 7/8 on fitted hats. 62 cm. head circumference.,B0002V9KK8
Well made wool cap. Nice to find a made in the USA product for a very reasonable price!,B0002V9KJY
Nice quality keeps head and ears very warm. Looks great on.,B0002V9KJY
"Have not used yet, but looks great and well made.  Looking forward to using it.  Made in the USA. 100% wool.",B0002V9KJY
"Love this hat.  Quality wool, quality hat.  Never seen one to buy outside of a PX, glad I came across one.",B0002V9KJY
"I have a big head, so I found this a little too tight and it didn't stretch. Wish they came in multiple sizes. However, it's real wool at a great price.",B0002V9KJY
"I bought this for myself , but my 8 year old son saw it and has been wearing it ever since it arrived.  We live in Ottawa Canada were the normal morning temps are around -8 F.  He loves it!  I did not give this five stars because I have not been able to touch the hat let alone wear it!",B0002V9KJY
"Had the exact same rothco jeep cap more than 14 years ago and lost it. I felt nostalgic and needed another winter hat so Ipurchased a new one. No complaints. It looks, fits, and feels exactly like my old one! I do wish they would make it in charcoal grey wool though but other than that I'm a satisfied customer.",B0002V9KJY
"Intended to upgrade a rayon jeep cap, these are junk.",B0002V9KJY
"great cap, just be careful how you wash and dry it or it will shrink",B0002V9KJY
"great hat, thick and warm. it was a little tight and i have a thin head but it loosened up after some use.",B0002V9KJY
It's a hat. With a bill. And it's cheap and wooly.,B0002V9KJY
"This is my favoirte fall and winter cap.  wool keeps my head warm, visor is small but sufficient to block the sun, can be pulled over my eyebrows.  No need to worry when rolled and put into my pocket.  hat can be pulled down to cover ears. M1 steel pot easily worn over the jeep cap.  Rothco is the genuine gov't issue, not some fancy smancy designer brand.",B0002V9KJY
"Well made and arrived in a timely manner.  Keeps your head warm.  It is a snug fit, so beware that one size may not truly fit all.",B0002V9KJY
Excellent genuine government issue. I've been searching for one in Army / Navy stores since I lost the one that had served me well for 7+ years. I'll be buying spares.,B0002V9KJY
"I bought this shirt for my husband last Christmas. He absolutely likes it. It arrived a few days after I purchased it. The only thing I would have liked more is a variation of colors. Unfortunately, it only comes in black. I would definitely buy more shirts for my husband if they had more options in color.",B0002V9JKY
"I ordered an XL for my husband and in most shirts that would be almost too big.  This shirt however, is tight on the sleeve cuffs and snug on his shoulders.  He still loves the shirt and is planning on just stretching it when he washes it.",B0002V9JKY
FINDING A SHIRT IN MY SIZE THAT I WANT AND IS GOOD QUALITY AND PRICED  RIGHT IS HARD TO DO.  SO FAR I AM IMPRESSED,B0002V9JKY
"My boyfriend loves wearing it and i do love to know that he likes wearing his marine corps polo shirt very nice fabric quality and the marine corps logo embroidery looks very good good detailed, nice job i do strongly recommend this product.",B0002V9JKY
The fabric on this shirt was heavy duty and well constructed.  The embroidered symbol was very well done.  Will do business with again!,B0002V9JKY
the fit and feel is great Thank you,B0002V9JKY
Quality shirt but I had to re-order because they run large.  I normally wear a 2xl but the reviews said it was tight and small so I got a 3xl.  I washed it in hot water 3 time and  dried it right away and it was still too big. I ordered a XL which should fit nicely.,B0002V9JKY
"Material is polyester, NOT cotton as stated. Sleeves are more a ""straight"" cut, not tapered with the sleeve ends as shown in the picture. Embroidery is INCONSISTENT with the image shown. NOT true to size, runs large. Overall dissatisfied with product.",B0002V9JKY
"It's awesome that it arrived really fast but it's the wrong size, I needed XXL so I'm returning it to exchange and hope I get the replacement before XMAS. Other than that great product.",B0002V9JKY
Bought this shirt as a gift for my Marine father.  Really good looking shirt.  He has received a number of compliments while wearing it.  Order the size you think you wear.  Originally order an XL and it was huge.,B0002V9JKY
I thought the eagle globe and anchor was kind of generic,B0002V9JKY
Not top quality. Shrunk quite a bit after the first wash.,B0002V9JKY
"I wear a size Medium in all shirts so I ordered this one in medium and the length went down to the middle of my thigh.  WAY TOO BIG.  Also, very broad on the shoulders, I was swimming in it.  It's almost as if they sent me a XL and labeled it medium.",B0002V9JKY
"As a Marine, I am highly disappointed! The embroidery in the image is completely different than what I received. The shown image shows a large, bold, and defined ""Marines"" as well as EGA. What I received had ""Marines"" in a thin cursive writing and the EGA was smaller and less defined. It looked cheap and like someone made this in their garage or basement. I would be embarrassed to wear this, which is why I returned it.",B0002V9JKY
"I can't say enough about this shirt as it was a favorite of my dad's when I purchased it for him - and might I add, he is a tough critic when it comes to clothing quality, fit, style, etc.  In a nutshell, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this US MARINES golf shirt for any man - well made, looks very sharp, and is incredibly comfortable (according to one who has worn it several times)  The emblem is beautifully woven and really stands out nicely on the black background.  My father, a Captain, was very proud to wear this at a recent USMC battalion reunion which made me very happy as well.  A+++++ and 5-STARS without any hesitation...great buy!",B0002V9JKY
Wasn't cotton as advertised. It is polyester. I'm afraid it will snag. Looks good. Very light weight if you are looking for a heavy shirt.,B0002V9JKY
The xl was to long for him and a bit roomy across the chest,B0002V9JKY
HUGE! Order at least one size smaller than normal. Trust me! The quality was nice but I can comment on the durability since he can't wear the dang thing,B0002V9JKY
"Size ran a bit large, but overall a very good quality shirt that use to golf in frequently. Very comfortable and cool.",B0002V9JKY
"Not a fan. The embroidery of the emblem and the font of the ""Marines"" is NOTHING like it shows on this shirt. Not to mention when I looked at the tag... it says it's made in PAKISTAN!!!!???? I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who is a retired Marine. If I were to have given this to him, he would have been absolutely APPALLED.",B0002V9JKY
The shirt was embroidered with the right size emblem.,B0002V9JKY
My wife bought me this polo for valentine day and I completely love it.  One of my favorites.,B0002V9JKY
"Great fit but the seem on one side was not sewn, so there is a rather large hole in the shirt we received. This was a Christmas gift for my father in law, a retired marine, who due to illness was not able to open until now. Amazon please help to remedy this error.",B0002V9JKY
Fits great. Love the fabric and quality of item.,B0002V9JKY
One of the attractions to this shirt other than the obvious ...100% cotton. It is not. It is 100% polyester. The logo resembles the Eagle Globe and Anchor....looks like it moved in the machine.  So now this shirt goes in the closet with all the other shirts I cannot or will not wear. Buyer beware.,B0002V9JKY
for some reason i got a polyester version and it's cut is too big for me. threw it away immediately.,B0002V9JKY
The first one ripped down the side seam first time I ordered.  I tried another and it was fine.  Love the subtle logo.,B0002V9JKY
"Finally, a reasonably priced USMC Polo of God quality, not made by some jar head at the bottom of a river. Oooooh to the rah!",B0002V9JKY
"Size large fit as expected, straight  cut not athletic fit.  It is a heavy weight cotton polo.  Nice quality shirt",B0002V9JKY
"Sorry, my error. I thought I had better order large, but I did not allow for the Very large I received. The shirts are Great. I will find a buddy marine to wear them. And I will order medium and all will be good.",B0002V9JKY
"My husband loves his Marine Corp shirts.
The polo style is great for dressing up.",B0002V9JKY
Very nice shirt. Fits my exact size. Nice quality.,B0002V9JKY
"The shirt had two holes in it, one in the armpit and one in lower back of shirt.  I could tell it was bad when the shirt had a lot of thread coming out near seams.",B0002V9JKY
when I received it and open the Packages there was a big hole in the back side of a brand new shirt don't know why but that tells me it was Not New,B0002V9JKY
"I like it, but it seems to not hold the shape too well.  It looks good initially, but as the day wears on, it gets loose and looks boxy.  It was a gift for my husband.",B0002V9JKY
Love it!  Will order another soon!,B0002V9JKY
Good quality polo. Love that the emblem is embroidered  Can't beat the price either.,B0002V9JKY
I got this for my husband who has been in the marine corps for 9 years. He loves it. Great price for the quality and it fits him well,B0002V9JKY
"Really nice shirt , I got it as a gift and he loved it",B0002V9JKY
Was worried that it would shrink in the wash but came out ok.  Good quality and very pleased,B0002V9JKY
Gift was well received and fit perfectly.,B0002V9JKY
"Nice shirt and true to size. The shirt tail is long, so if you are short in stature keep that in mind.",B0002V9JKY
"Since I was buying a new Marine Corps Cap, I figured I would get a polo to wear with it. It's not a bad quality polo, it's just not the top quality of all my other polo's that run the color spectrum. But it's worth the money and does look good with my Jarhead cap!
Semper Fi",B0002V9JKY
Loved the shirt.  Looks good and the detail is great.  Fits and wears nice.  Very satisfied.,B0002V9JKY
This is the shirt every Marine should have in there closet.,B0002V9JKY
Fits well and seems very well made. Very happy with it.,B0002V9JKY
Fits great and is a great looking shirt,B0002V9JKY
Prominent well done logo. Good material.,B0002V9JKY
"It's a great item, love it! Semper fi!",B0002V9JKY
This shirt is made very well. Very attractive on.,B0002V9JKY
"Beautiful shirt !  I got this shirt in 2XL, black with wonderful gold threaded embroidered logo.  Terrific !  Heavy cotton, looks great, good quality for a reasonable price.  The gold embroidery is first class !  It had one loose button, the top one, but a few stitches fixed that.  I know they use machines to sew buttons on these day, but a simple fix.  My husband loves it and we wish it came in more colors, we'd buy them all !!  ENJOY !!",B0002V9JKY
Shirt is excellent. Fits good and the embroidery is excellent. Very sastisfied.,B0002V9JKY
This golf shirt was superior quality and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Marine Corps logo golf shirt. The only thing is that all my other golf shirts are 3x and this one hung off me like sheet so I had to return it and go with a smaller size. The product itself though is a great product.,B0002V9JKY
"This shirt fits nicely, but runs a little larger than the size indicated. The embroidery on the logo is first rate and really stands out. I would recommend this shirt to any jarhead who wants to step up in dress from a t-shirt, but still wants to fly the logo.",B0002V9JKY
"It looks really good on my Marine and more importantly, he likes it a lot.",B0002V9JKY
It is  a nice shirt but the  material is not your typical soft type.,B0002V9JKY
"Perfect Fit, Nice Quality Material, ""My Favorite Marine Shirt"".
Quick Shipment and a great value for the money.
I would recommend this shirt to everyone.
""Semper Fi"".",B0002V9JKY
"Gave the shirt to my Dad for Father's day. He is a United States Marine Vet.
Big bold letters on the tag said made in China.
Odd that a United States Marine Shirt was made in China.",B0002V9JKY
"I like the shirt a lot, however it was much too big. I reordered it in medium and am looking forward to receiving it.",B0002V9JKY
"I am a 2xl and the shirt came as such, but it shrank after going through a warm/cold wash cycle and a warm dryer cycle. Forget it.",B0002V9JKY
"i would recommend this to anyone it fit exactly how i expected , thanks for making my day i will order again",B0002V9JKY
"Shirt fits great, looks great and feels great. It isn't the light breathable material out there today but I enjoy it just as much.",B0002V9JKY
Love the shirt and I got it on time..  Not sure what else to say  here..  Nice material..  Just Fine,B0002V9JKY
Got this shirt for my husband and my son had to have one.  It is a nice fit and would recommend.,B0002V9JKY
"I didn't want this shirt to fade so I have been air drying it to maximize its life. The material is a bit thick for Florida summers, but the shirt is well made and I can wear it proudly.",B0002V9JKY
My husband loved this shirt.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a military golf shirt.  It was a good gift.,B0002V9JKY
"The shirts are too short, im a big guy and have to tuck my shirt in for work and i cant tuck these in...",B0002V9JKY
This is a Xmas present for my dad. He will wear it when he goes to his marine corps reunion in August I'm sure.,B0002V9JKY
Great quality!  We purchased this shirt for my father-in-law.  He plays golf and was in the Marines.  The shirt is of great quality!,B0002V9JKY
nice shirt with a distinctive look. This is a great shirt for environments where a tee shirt is not appropriate. Size chart is accurate.,B0002V9JKY
"Bought it for my husband, we liked it, it is really nice.",B0002V9JKY
Love the MC Emblem on the shirt.  Great fit,B0002V9JKY
The description says cotton. This is the strangest polyester cotton I've ever experienced. Otherwise a good shirt. Semper Fidelis,B0002V9JKY
Fit great! Bought it to wear to our Marine Corps birthday celebration at work. Order whatever size you feel you wear.,B0002V9JKY
Great shirt I wore it yesterday and received several compliments must be the insignia,B0002V9JKY
"This shirt came as pictured, with only the USMC insignia and no writing.
As other reviewers noted, however, the material may differ. I received not the cotton one as described, but the shinier polyester golf shirt material. I knew that might happen and was going to be happy either way, but if you want/need the cotten, look elsewhere.",B0002V9JKY
looks and feels like cheap replacement for the real thing!,B0002V9KQM
I love this thing and so do all of my friends apparently because I keep having to replace stolen ones.,B0002V9KQM
"Hate to have cold wind blowing down my neck and this works great to prevent it.  I only use it when hunting and yes, as far as I am concerned it DOES get cold in Florida.",B0002V9KQM
Very itchy and the second it snagged on something (the day I first used it) a lot of yarn got pulled out and bunched up. I never wore it again. Don't waste your money!,B0002V9KQM
"Good product. It looks like I will havze to iron it because it came so tightly wrapped that there are bends everywhere. Order was size up (which is what I did).

Fits perfect.",B0002VANXG
"My 13 year old son loves his new camo hat.  It fits him well, and he loves wearing it around.",B0002VANXG
Fit is true to size. Camo provides excellent breakup while the orange helps keep my noggin from being confused with a rack of antlers.,B0002VANXG
"Bought hat for my son. Glad for the chin strap, and sturdy but washable hat. Not sure if size runs big, or if I just bought one size too big... hope he grows in to the Large.",B0002VANXG
Hat came on time. I gave it as a gift. I put it in my grandson stocking. They are going to Maui after Christmas.,B0002VANXG
"Very good quality, size run a little small - order next larger. About the same as G.I. issue,  great work hat, folds good.",B0002VANXG
"Hat arrived in good time.  Looks well-made, but the medium is a bit small. Not a problem, one of my friends liked the style, it fits him, so I gave it to him! I had planned ahead, and bought one in large, which is great.  I'll continue the review on the large hat in the other order.",B0002VANXG
"Bought this for my husband since he works outside all year round and needs one, esp for summer and he loves it. Good color/design for him and serves it's purpose.",B0002VANXG
"it fits my 4year old perfectly!  He looks good and brim is stiff enough to keep rain water away from his upper head.  Construction is very nice, it retains its shape even when its raining.  the chin strap is straighforward and it works like it should.",B0002VANXG
"Based on other reviews, I ordered a size larger than I needed, and it is still way too small! It seems like too much of a pain to return, so it is a total waste.",B0002VANXG
"The hat seems well enough made.  Sizing is a bit on the small side.  I'm happy I didn't need it immediately, as it would probably be tight enough to give me a headache.  It'll work fine for my wife.
While it may not be mil spec, I was happy to find that it did not glow under UV light.",B0002VANXG
"Too small. Orderd M fit like S
Gave to bf and he looks hot in it haha",B0002VANXG
"The inside headband is flimsy and not sewn to the hat, so it hangs down all the time forcing me to have to tuck it back up into the hat constantly... or run around looking tattered. Too bad, as the bright orange, old school camo looks great.",B0002VANXG
What you see is what you get! I like it!,B0002VANXG
"This hat is of moderate quality, consistent with its price. Stitching has its shortcomings in places, uneven at times but seems to be holding after some bushwhacking in reasonably heavy brush. It did shrink up a good bit at least one size, maybe a size and a half, with a cold wash, so you will likely want to buy it a bit large to compensate. Given I have an XL head, I had to pull and stretch on it a good bit to bring it back up to size; even then it's still a bit small so I may end up having to buy a different hat. A bit disappointing in that regard. Headband is surprisingly rough in quality; it feels like it's abrading my forehead and uncomfortable at times. I'd wash it a few times to soften it up some, but I'm afraid of more shrinkage. Can't go with fabric softener as I'm concerned about scent. I may be stuck with handwashing, which would be truly disappointing. If it shrinks up in the rain, then it will be a true fail.",B0002VANXG
"Please don;t call it an accu boonie hat, made in china. unless made accu for chinese red army. not a hater, just a lover of our/USA military. Don't buy this hat, it is a disgraceful knock-off",B0002VANXG
Nice Hat but not large enough for that particular person who it was meant for:),B0002VANXG
This hat is a quality product and my son just loves it!,B0002VANXG
"It is too small. According to the sizing, it should have been 2 inches too big. Disappointed.",B0002VANXG
"I have been extremely please with this hat.  It is comfortable, wears well and seems to be quite durable.  The hat keeps the sun off my head and during a recent rain, it also kept me equally dry.  This hat is highly recommended!",B0002VANXG
"Pretty much what I expected.  I have a true size 8 head and this hat is just a little snug.  Other than that, it's worth the money.",B0002VANXG
Love this hat. I have a few jungle hats and this is one of the best. Nicely made and can endure a lot of washings.,B0002VANXG
looks good and keeps the sun off.,B0002VANXG
"Sizing is right, and has the features the mod one jungle hat needed.  Keeps the rain off, doesn't get too hot, can be crunched up and rolled back out.  The color is useful for hunting trips, hiking, or just walking the dog .... you can be seen, so hopefully not shot or run over.",B0002VANXG
"This hat as a 2xxl hat fits my huge head well. Usually I have problems finding a good fitting hat and this is it. If you have a big head this is the hat to buy. It is well made, I bought it to help fight sunburn on long hikes and walks and I am satisfied my money was well spent",B0002VANXG
"Got this hat and the blue camo hat for my little guy both are made by  Rothco but the blue one is much nicer better vents and better interior work. The orange camo has a cheap sweatband on it. All in all the hat is ok just be happier if it was more along the lines of the blue camo hats quality from Rothco.
This seller was great and I received the hat quick",B0002VANXG
The sizes of the hat were not clear. As a result mine came too small.,B0002VANXG
"This hat completely hid me well in the orange tree jungle, deep in the mystical Florida glades. It must have been extremely hot(or I was on something) 'cus I swear I was talking to 2 orange cats, one  Heathcliff, the other called himself Garfield. We were all trying to stay out of sight in this jungle of oranges. Hiding from a mad-tiger called Tony and his loony Cheetah pal, Chester. Tony really really thought cereal was just great, & verbally expressed that feeling loud & often. Chester was a hipster Cheetah who had an intense cheese craving seemingly at all times. He had this screwy idea of making cheese go crunch. These 2 insane psycho mentally ill cats scared me to death. But, 'cus I wore this orange camo hat, I survived to tell the (fish)tale that I just finished telling.

The End",B0002VANXG
"I purchased this for my 6 year old son.  It is the only hat he will wear in the sun.  He loves the orange camo pattern and the drawstring around his neck, as he lets it hang over his back when he doesn't feel like wearing it.  It is durable and great for an outdoorsy kid.",B0002VANXG
"City jungle camo hat?  it really doesn't seem like a jungle hat.  I always pictured those as a bit more pithy.  This is cloth hat, made for concrete colored foliage. The real trick to using a hat like this is getting one big enough so it doesn't clamp onto your head like a ... like a ... head clamp. Then it will be comfortable and fun to wear ... in the asphalt jungle.  Seriously, it will look like a body with no head!",B0002VANXG
"Better quality than competitors. Got a small for my four year old. He loves it. Big kids did too and tried to steal it. Not! Don't touch my kid, or his hat!",B0002VANXG
I got this hat for my grandson for Christmas. He is thrilled with it.  Says he will wear it every day.  It fits well and is great for protection from the sun.,B0002VANXG
"I have purchased 3 of these Rothco boonie hats on Amazon, so far.  The sizing matches the Description.  The high visibility Orange camo gets me noticed in the woods, and in a crowd.  I got the first one in Orange because I wanted to go hiking without any hunters thinking that I am a deer, and also so that I'd get noticed when walking our dog in our neighborhood so that cars wouldn't think I was a deer.  My wife says that the Orange camo looks, ""too ugly.""  So, now I wear it when we shop, so that she can see me in a crowd.  This Rothco Orange boonie hat is also super comfortable and rugged.  My Mom liked it so much that I had to buy 2 more to give one to her and one to my Step-Dad, so that we can all match when hiking.",B0002VANXG
"Looks good and keeps my bald head warm and dry, too.  Good construction.  Wish the brim was wider to keep the sun off, otherwise fine.",B0002VANXG
"Horribly ugly hat.  Which is exactly why I bought it.  It fits a little more snug than I would have liked.  I used the instructions on Amazon as well as Rothco's website for fitting.  The finish isn't the greatest as there is a sweat band that lays over where the brim is sewn under the top of the hat.  That seam sits out a little too far so the sweat band doesn't sit flat.  The finish isn't as good as the other hats I own like this, but the price was outstanding and the problems are easily overlooked.",B0002VANXG
This is a very strong and durable hat that's lasted me quite awhile without the colors fading or rips in the fabric. The chin strap is very well attached as well. I was expecting a piece of junk for what I paid but I'm very pleased with my purchase,B0002VANXG
"Sizing is a bit off on these according to the sizing chart provided. My hat size is 7.75 (an XL on the chart), but the hat is more like a 7.5 or slightly smaller. Too small for my giant melon.

The hat itself looks fine. Will likely gift this one. May or may not buy another in super size for myself.",B0002VANXG
"Only reason I cant give this five stars is the fact its not LRG. Other than that im quite glad I bought this, it fits well, quite comfortable, rolls up nice, and will keep all the water and sun off your face that you can throw at it! Overall very satisfied with this.",B0002VANXG
"Advisable, good to get one a size smaller than you think. It will be able to stay on your head in heavy winds. Good price, and a good sale.",B0002VANXG
This hat is decent quality and the camo pattern is particularly good for winter urban use.  Sizes seem to run a little small and the large fits fine now but will be too small if it shrinks after washing.,B0002VANXG
"It's a very comfortable hat. I have a couple in this style, but only one orange  one. It will be a good hunting cap.",B0002VANXG
The hat has a great pattern.  The hat should stand out while hiking in the mountains.  It has a good feel and appropriate fit.,B0002VANXG
It's a hat.  it's hard not to like a hat that you wanted to buy.  it blocks the sun while on a boat just fine.,B0002VANXG
"I was looking for a hat for our cruise to the Bahamas and the style and color scheme are perfect. It is a polyester crown hat with a cotton brim. I have a small head,6 7/8 is my usual size, so I ordered a small. However,there's not much of a sweatband inside the hat and there's not much give in the polyester crown of the hat which made the small a little snug.",B0002VANXG
"The hat is rolled up and secured with a rubber band inside the small plastic bag. After I unrolled the hat, it kept rolling back up and had two deep creases in the material. Even when wearing it the front and back would bind up at the crease and cause the hat to droop down in front of my left eye. After trying to work out the creases for over an hour with no progress what so ever, I gave up and returned it for a refund.",B0002VANXG
"Not a floppy sun hat at all, but happy with the quality. Wish I ordered a size smaller... way too big for my 10 yr old.",B0002VANXG
I have a very big head and it was hard to find anyone selling xxl hats this hat fits like a glove thanks,B0002VANXG
Fit is great and it looks like its very thick durable material.  I'd def compare it to Mil-Spec headgear.  The orange is good for hunting and the sun shade will be perfect for summer varmint hunts.,B0002VANXG
"Great pattern, but sizes run small so be warned.  I have to return the medium for an extra large and my head is 22"".",B0002VANXG
it was a great price and well made,B0002VANXG
"we go to the community pool everyday and my husband wears it everytime to protect from our hot sun, he loves this hat!",B0002VANXG
"This is a very good 'boonie hat', slightly taller than some. The web sight and tag lists the size as 'L' . It fits me well, and is about the same size as a 7 1/4 hat I have. The tag says 55% cotton 45% polyester, a good mix for this hat.
I use it for walking near woods during hunting season and for bike riding for extra visibility. The color is a bit wild and vivid but that is what I wanted.",B0002VANXG
Must have worked well as I didn't get shot last hunting season,B0002VANXG
Gives good shade and I feel more comfortable when I walk in the woods in the Fall !!!!  You know why !!!!,B0002VANXG

"My head is normal sized, I ordered a large and it's  to small.  It doesn't  say child size anywhere. Like the color though.",B0002VANJA
I love my booney hat! I use it while working in my garden. It really helps to keep bugs off! Not to mention it is an awesome fashion accesorie!,B0002VANJA
"My daughter wanted a purple hat so I got her this. I have a green and a desert boonie hat that she likes so she should love this one.
If you want a hat for summer this is perfect and would recommend it to anyone.",B0002VANJA
I have a tan one that is older and wanted a new green one. Found this and its exactly the same minus the age. I live in the tropics and wear them both daily.,B0002VANJA
Hat fits well; nice.  like color and design. too much hair to fit really well. I will recommend to others,B0002VANJA
Perfect item for our all boys school. Our colors are purple and gold. Could not find anything for our step team to wear except the traditional camo's. The boys love their uniform and with this product they beam with confidence. From all of us Spartan parents thank you.,B0002VANJA
It's everything I was hoping it would be . It keeps my bald spot from burning in the arizona warmth.,B0002VANJA
"I LOVE this hat! It is comfy, and cool looking.  I am not a hat person, but I love wearing this during hikes.",B0002VANJA
"I got this hat because I am a football coach and I like to wear this style of hat during practice.  It close to our school colors.

Hat fits well and blocks the sun. Wait and see on the how it is after I was it.",B0002VANJA
Pretty nice hat. Ran a little tight. It is OK quality. After going through several snow storms it still seems to be holding up.,B0002VANJA
"This hat is of very poor quality. Bad crafting and materials. Look elsewhere, as this is not worth the cost.",B0002VANJA
"You get what you pay for and this hat applies. I would point out that for the price, the value of this hat is good. While I would say it is a bit flimsy and cheaply put together, it certainly will work for a simple cheap boonie hat. I have the Under Armour version of a boonie and there is no denying that there is no comparison, the UA hat kills it. The UA hat is more than twice the price of this hat, so this is to be no surprise. All in all I am happy with the purchase.",B0002VANJA
I have an regular camo hat that I bought from a surplus store in the late 90s. There is no way that the one I just bought will last that long.,B0002VANJA
"Great boonie, used in pool (yes under water and out) doesn't shrink actually repels water. Great quality. My new favorite outdoor hat. The vent holes actually work in letting moisture evaporate. good hat not much else to say.",B0002VANJA
"Great hat. Good quality. I wore it while visiting my father last week in another city and he liked it so much he took it from me. I just ordered another one. One word of caution is that it seems to be sized slightly smaller than you may expect. I normally wear a 7.5, but this hat in 7.5 is a little tighter than expected. You may want to go up to the next size.",B0002VANJA
When I received the hat I inspected for stitching quality. Upon further review I notice they sent out the wrong size. However I would order this product again if the right size become available,B0002VANJA
I was worried because this arrived all rolled up but after shaping it the wrinkles mostly fell out after a day or two.  Color is true to the picture.,B0002VANJA
"A well built hat, but unfortunately for a small hat it was extra small. I used a hat stretcher and now fits OK.",B0002VANJA
Company not quite ready for prime-time.,B0002VANJA
Perfect fit and loving the color.,B0002VANJA
Good product if you have a purple outfit!  :-)  Fits well,B0002VANJA

Perfect fit and very comfortable.,B0002Y3LEG
"When I buy these in a store I always get the petite; however, when ordering online I didn't realize I had a choice of petite regular or petite small and unfortunately I got the petite small when I should have had the petite regular.  Ive kept them and worn them... they could be just a tad longer but they're okay.  Love the material!",B0002Y3LEG
"I bought these pants because I have worn this brand and knew it would fit.  However, it soon started losing threads and had to be sewn back together.  I am still wearing them, but I really expect the clothes I buy to be ready to wear, not ready to repair.",B0002Y3LEG
"Very comfortable. Perfect for my job as insurance broker. Will be getting more in different colors. I am 5'2"". Petite short was slightly too short but that was my only complaint.",B0002Y3LEG
"the pants have a gentle taper to the shoe area. and looks very neat and professional.  graceful leg shape.  not clinging anywhere.
best 14P pants I have ever found.the gathers in the waist band are slight and well-stitched and do not produce a baggy waist area
in the front nor in the back.  I will buy several more of rhia ""Alia"" 14P in this black microfiber twill which feels wonderful, and has just the right thickness, yet soft to the touch.  should launder well. I love these pants. the fit is perfect.  I am 5'2 1/2 "" tall. the bottom of the pant's leg is just right.",B0002Y3LEG
"I have lost weight so most of my slacks are too large. These slacks are a good fit, which is hard to find when you are very short. I love them.",B0002Y3LEG
"Actually, too short. But regulars are too long.",B0002Y3LEG
"So difficult to find slacks to fit a really short person.  Delighted to find one with a 25"" inseam!  My mom is very happy with this Christmas gift!  They wash and dry and come out ready to wear, too.  And the legs aren't [note this correction to my original post!] so wide they make your legs look like tree trunks.  The only slight drawback is that the material is a bit on the slightly thin side, but because they're polyester, they're not as cold as they would be if they were cotton of this heft.

My mom now owns 4 pairs, and they get worn every week; they're dressy enough to wear ""out,"" and comfortable enough to wear ""in.""",B0002Y3LEG
I need to return them.  They are too large is belly area and though I did not order short length they are an S.,B0002Y3L6Y

"It would be ok for a doll. It is very short. I am 5""7 and this comes just below my breast. Very disappointed. Also the straps are cris crossed and very irritating",B0002ZQXXQ
"Nice feeling material, etc but at XL it did not fit me in the least (size 16). Not sure about the straps for the other busty women out there, they seemed weak.  Maybe if I slim down I can put it on and judge better ;)",B0002ZQXXQ
Adorable for the thicker girl! But for the big breasted not so much! I was popping out but my boyfriend begged me to keep it on so I guess its man approved! wasn't expecting the criss cross straps in the back though.,B0002ZQXXQ
Beautiful. Makes me feel very sexy and my husband enjoyed it immensely. I highly recommend this item. You won't be disappointed.,B0002ZQXXQ
I thought it was beautiful when I bought it. It made the perfect gift for my friend but I wish it had come with some boyshorts. That thong looks mighty uncomfortable.,B0002ZQXXQ
The quality is good but the sizes run a little big. Other than that my SO and I love it :),B0002ZQXXQ

A great tee for travel. Comfortable by itself or under a shirt. Can be washed in the sink and be ready to go by morning. Goes well with their briefs.,B0003216GM
"Bought them for an upcoming Alaska adventure, to avoid packing too much. Haven't tried the drying out process yet, but they are a nice material and fit well. Have a couple pair of the boxer-shorts, and like the fit as well, and drying was fine. I suspect these will work just fine as well.",B0003216GM
"I have a lot of Ex-Officio products - they make great travel/outdoor pants and shirts.  I ordered two of these undershirts in medium and they fall short - literally and figuratively.  I am a perfect medium size and 5' 10"" tall. While the width around the torso is fine, the length is too short - it barely meets my belt line. I should have studied the catalog photo more closely, you can see for yourself, the proportion indicates a shorter length.",B0003216GM
"I find that many t-shirts absorb sweat, and then the wearer sits in sweat for hours.  As a sweat-er myself, I've tried many brands to find the one that doesn't leave me uncomfortable.  This one is the best I have found, and I have since bought several of this brand.  People who sweat a lot will know what I am talking about when you are worried if others can see your sweat stains.  Not only does this shirt help prevent that, but it feels cool and comfortable to wear.  I wear these under dress shirts, and the only drawback is that it doesn't necessarily fit as snugly around the neck as I would prefer.  To me it's not attractive enough to wear as a shirt on its own, but as a undershirt it is perfect.",B0003216GM
"I am a huge fan of Ex Officio and have been using their Exo-Dri Tee's for quite some time now. To say I absolutely love them would be a massive understatement. So when it came time to buy more tee's I just automatically went with the Exo-Dri. Well, I came across a sale last week that had some of these shirts for a really low price so I decided to ""give them a go"" (That's my pun for the day). Anyways, it was ultimately a disappointing decision as these shirts just don't impress me at all.

As I stated in my Exo-Dri reviews I prefer my wicking/athletic shirts to have some cotton in them, usually in a ratio of 1:4 or 1:5, as it makes the shirts far more comfortable and doesn't noticeable hinder a shirts wicking properties. Unfortunately this shirt doesn't have any cotton. Its basically a nylon shirt with a bit of Lycra to give it some stretch (94% Nylon / 6% Lycra). Its certainly not an uncomfortable shirt, its just nowhere near as comfortable as their Exo-Dri tee's. The fit isn't as nice either as the Give'n'Go has a much slimmer fit. If your looking for a looser fit and your dead set on ordering this shirt, you might want to order a size up. The Give'n'Go also has a tagless label and the Aegis Microbe Shield to control odor-causing bacteria.

Don't get me wrong, this is a decent shirt and I am sure some people out there will actually like them. It just doesn't match up very well to their Exo-Dri Tee's, which imo are superior to these shirts in almost every way. In my opinion the Exo-Dri Tee's are softer, have a better fit, and are even better looking. I think Ex Officio's catalog speaks for itself. They only have 2 versions of the Give'n'Go (short sleeved crew neck & short sleeved v-neck) while the Exo-Dri now has 4 versions for men (short sleeve crew neck, long sleeve crew neck, quarter zip, and zip cricket short sleeved shirt). Women have it even better as there are 14 different Exo-Dri versions for women (I am not listing them!!). Basically, there are a lot more Exo-Dri shirts than Give'n'Go shirts and ultimately I think this speaks for itself.

Bottom line - The Give'n'Go is a decent shirt but Ex Officio offers something that is far superior, the Exo-Dri Tee. The Give'n'Go line has great underwear but unfortunately the T-shirts need some work. If your looking for a great athletic/wicking style T-shirt then you have found the right company, you just need to buy the Exo-Dri instead of the Give'n'Go.

3 Stars",B0003216GM
"light, comfortable in cold and hot temperatures; simple wash on the road/in the field; dries super quickly -- this, and their boxers, are great",B0003216GM
"This shirt worked great as a base layer for a recent hike i was on. It kept me cool and wicked the moisture away from my body. No arguements here, I feel this piece performed just like it stated. I'll be recommending this shirt to all my hiking buddies. I'd recommend ordering a size larger if you don't like a tight fit.",B0003216GM
"I wear a size large and ordered that size. I could barely get the shirt on. I wear a size 42 sport coat, so I'm not a big person, but this was sad. It was also over priced for the quality. Seems like Ex Officio needs to start making quality gear again.",B0003216GM

"When I received the 3 t-shirts I ordered, I discovered I should have paid attention to the many reviewers who warned that these are NOT Exificio t-shirts, as advertised.  It took many weeks to receive the tees, because they did indeed come direct from China, and they were indeed thin, cheap cotton t-shirts, not the breathable, quality, fine mesh shirts that ExOfficio ""Give-N-Go tees are known for.  I'm not even going to bother to send them back.  It's too much hassle.  I will, however, now heed other reviewers warnings.",B0003216GM
"Washes and dries great.  Took several of these on a month's trip to Europe and they were always dry and ready when I needed them.

"These shirts are great. They feel cool not sticky and handle intense workouts without smell. They fit perfect.  BUT, like all the ones I've bought in the past, they ""pill.""

"I absolutely love this shirt.  It is great for travelling - if you have two, you can wear one when showering in the morning, wring it out, hang it to dry, and it will be ready by the next day.  It is extremely comfortable and breathable, and stays tucked in without a problem.

A couple of notes:
The sleeves are a tad long for an undershirt - they are roughly the same length as a standard T-shirt's sleeves.  If you have any short sleeve shirts that are particularly short in the sleeve, this will come out from underneath.

This is NOT a shirt meant for much abuse - the material will pull easily if it does not have another shirt on top will you are carrying a heavy backpack (or accordion, as I found out) on your shoulders.

Treat this like an undershirt, and you will greatly enjoy it!  Get two and you can replace all of those lousy undershirts we had to buy from Kohl's in zip-lock bags.",B0003216GM
"Ordered two, one came with defect--pulled thread.  Otherwise an excellent product.  I bought it for an out-of-country trip and didn't have time to return it before I left and I needed it on the trip",B0003216GM
I have not worn it yet. I got it to deal with heat and sweat. It's too soon to tell. But it is nylon and should wash and dry fast in a pinch.,B0003216GM
"This has a more relaxed fit than the spot mesh series.  I'm 5'4"", 135lbs athletic build, so I ordered a small.  This tee is really loose around the chest and arm area.  The sleeve length is a bit long for my liking.  I use it as an undershirt and it works fine for wearing long sleeve over shirts.  However, if I'm wearing a small size, short sleeve polo as an over shirt it does not work well.  The sleeves on this tee hang below the sleeves of the over shirt which, I feel, emits a sloppy look.  For me personally, I prefer the ExOfficio sport mesh line in small.  It has a more form fitting feel, which makes the sleeves not fall too low to wear it as a short sleeve under shirt.  If you have a broader chest and arms this tee might be right for you, but it's not my personal preference.",B0003216GM
"Despite the SM size fitting more like a MED, this is essential for the touring musician. For two years now, this has been my stage shirt. Now, I wear it everyday on tour. I need no other shirts as prefer a small backpack load, and all I have to do is wash this in the hotel each night in the shower and it's good to go the next morning.  No smells, odors, no complaints.",B0003216GM
"Wore 3 of these for a 30-day backpacking trip through Europe, totaling over 260 miles of walking. They have a nice, slim fit and were everything as advertised as far as breath-ability, quick-drying, pack-ability, and comfort. The biggest downside is that the material shows wear (loses ""crispness"" and begins to develop snags) after several days of use. Highly recommended for anyone that wants a comfortable, affordable t-shirt for travel or hiking, but is willing to replace it after heavy use.

I rated the white one slightly lower than the black and grey due to how easily it stained! One day of light sweat and it was nearly ruined, except for use as an undershirt. Before that it was great!",B0003216GM
Worked very well for a three week trip. Washed and line dried nicely and wicked well. Quality item but careful for snags.,B0003216GM

"Worked great on a trip overseas.  I brought two and washed them regularly.  They reliably dried overnight.  They fit a bit smaller than I expected - I'd order a size larger if I had to do it over again.  They were a bit warmer feeling than the average cotton t-shirt and I was hoping (given other reviews) that wouldn't be the case.  The good news is that they kept me warm and comfy on cooler days, and they didn't smell quite as bad as a cotton t-shirt after use.  So bottom line is that they're a bit expensive, but there's a reason - they dry wonderfully and are very light.  I'll continue to use on travel trips where space is at a premium, but at home I'll stick with my cotton t's",B0003216GM
I bought these shirts for a long trip.  The shirt does dry overnight and is fairly comfortable.  I will use these only for travel when I need to limit what I pack.  They are a bit smaller than I'd like but otherwise it's a very nice travel undershirt.,B0003216GM
My husband loves this Tee - fits well and the material is great for super hot weather.  He tends to sweat a lot so this comes in handy.,B0003216GM
"I read the reviews and bought the large. I am 5'8"" and 175 lbs.  It fit fine.  It was easy to hand wash and dries overnight.  I had two of these for our two week vacation in Ireland. B using them I got away with only three shirts which I never had to wash. On a hot day this color can be worn by itself.",B0003216GM
"These are great! They last a long time. As far as performance shirts: these are far superior to anything from UnderArmor, this weave lycra is perfect and extremely durable. I actually went one size down and use it as a rash guard for scuba diving.",B0003216GM
I wear size Large Tees from many companies and this is the first one that is too tight.  I am disappointed and surprised since I have several of their regular shirts and the sizing is fine.  Have to return it.,B0003216GM
"ExOfficio is the brand if you are travelling or camping, easy to wash , comfortable and casual.",B0003216GM
"The shirt arrived promptly and fit accurately.  However, after only two wears while on vacation, the back of the the shirt looked like the fabric had been snagged in several places (it had not).  I only wore it to the pool on vacation, and at lunch in the afternoon.  So, after about 6 hours of wear, it was moderately damaged.
THEN... we got home and after washing it, the entire front of the shirt had the same problems.  I have two, so the other one didn't get worn, but we are washing it to see if it gets damaged as well.
I was excited to get it, and liked the fit, but will not be able to wear it again.  I also ordered a couple other ExOfficio products that seem to be pretty decent, but I would certainly re-think this if I were giving advice.",B0003216GM
"Nice t-shirt. High ExOfficio quality, but this is a size small for a XXL. I will have to be an undershirt, not worn by itself.",B0003216GM
My boyfriend love this and wears all the time!,B0003216GM
"I'm a fan of exofficio...  I think it's expensive, but it truly is above average in comfort...  It is unique material that is light and breathable.  The only think I wish is that they made this shirt in a long.",B0003216GM
Very comfortable in all types of weather.  The material is thin so you hardly aware that you are wearing it. Best tee on the market but a bit pricey.,B0003216GM
"The shirt fits well aroun5d the chest & shoulders, but it is just a bit shorter than I would like - I'm 5' 10"".",B0003216GM
"My husband loves his Give-N-Go Tee Shirt. It has an excellent fit....not too large and not too small. It looks great at his neckline when he wears it under open collar shirts. It actually looks ""a little dressier"" than a typical white cotton tee shirt. I bought several of these when we were going to take a trip and found they were easy to hand wash and then dry quickly. After seeing how nice they were, I also bought some briefs for my husband and they are equally as nice. Highly recommend!!",B0003216GM
Began pilling almost immediately (first wash) and has rapidly disintegrated since.  What happened to ExOfficio? The quality of these shirts is terrible!,B0003216GM
Just do yourself a favor and make the investment and replace all of your boxers with these. You'll never regret it.,B0003216GM
"Best undershirt ever.
After trying dozens of different undershirts from cotton beaters to Underarmor, Colombia and every brand at the sports stores this is by far the coolest, lightest most sweat wicking T shirt I've worn. Seriously comfortable it's soft and loose unlike the superman compression of lots of other tight performance t's (and I can wear it alone without looking weird.)

It wears loosely, looks normal on its own and after literally wearing it for two weeks without washing it it didn't smell at all. Then I hand washed it in the sink with a spoonfull of Woolight and after a few hours on a hanger under a ceiling fan it was dry and good to go. I wear this under shirts, under scrubs, on its own and never have a bead of sweat on my back, never have body odor and after a few months of near constant use it has worn quite well.
Just ordered another one.",B0003216GM
Best quality I have found so worth the money.  Wicks without getting clingy.,B0003216GM
"Most comfortable shirt I have ever put on. Light weight, breathes well, fits as expected. I wear this as an undershirt and will never wear anything else!",B0003216GM
I love the Exofficio product and the way the Give-N-Go material feels.  I don't want to wear any other kind of underwear.,B0003216GM
"The shirt is very comfortable.  It feels great on you, but after only a few weeks the shirts have lots of snags in them.  I don't do anything other than cardio so this is happening in the wash.  I've never had this issue with Nike or UnderArmor shirts.  Given the price and the fact that the shirt only looks good for a couple of months, I'm afraid I can't recommend it.",B0003216GM
"been wearing these for years.  first started for travel use, but then switched to daily for work.  more expensive than cotton, but highly recommended.",B0003216GM
Light and cool - need more of them...,B0003216GM
My husband loves ExOfficio products. They fit well and are great for travel. We travel a lot and they wash and dry much better than all cotton.,B0003216GM
"my husband loves the shirt, keeps him cool and he can wear it as a undershirt or on its own",B0003216GM
"As great as their boxer shorts are, these are the exact opposite. So small and tight, it is like they used a regular guy like me as their model for the boxer shorts and some kind of 0% body fat alien for their shirts. Most uncomfortable shirt I've ever owned. I gave it to my young fit son, but I don't think he wears it either. Just a bad product for the ""everyman"".",B0003216GM
"I purchased the regular neck and received a ""V"" neck instead that had been previously opened?",B0003216GM
"I've owned other ExOfficio shirts and briefs, so I knew what to expect when I bought these. Very smooth and comfortable on the skin. This one has a regular neck line, so you can wear this as an undershirt or like a T-shirt. I live in Hawaii where it can get very humid, and these kept me cool and comfortable during our recent muggy weather. I'd give it 5 stars if the material were a little thicker.",B0003216GM
"When in doubt, get the next size up. Packing this wash & wear has allowed me to pack extremely light and efficiently.",B0003216GM
"This is great for my husband to wear under dress shirts, great to travel overseas with as it can be washed in the sink -- but the sleeves are extraordinarily long for a Tee. He cannot wear this under any of his polo shirts, which he almost always wears with an undershirt. This shirt is not the same dimensions as the Hanes undershirts he normally wears. That is clear in the picture, but we were still surprised by the sleeve length.",B0003216GM
"I bought two of these shirts for a backpacking trip. I love the boxers this brand has but these shirts don't live up to the legend.

This one was very easily stained and quickly became worthless to me.

Stains and user error aside, these shirts wrinkle EXTREMELY easily. It was a comfortable shirt but it never really looked good. Maybe decent as an around the house shirt but I was not impressed.",B0003216GM
Great shirt. a little pricy but  very functional,B0003216GM
this shirt is great for exercising on the road when you are going to sweat,B0003216GM
"These T-shirts (I have 2 pair) I've been able to wash by hand in the evening, roll into a hotel towel and twist dry, then hang overnight and they're dry in the morning. So I'd be able to travel with just one set, but I go with 2.

They're also breathable and comfortable in warm weather.",B0003216GM
"Feels so soft on my skin. Let me warn you though, it collects lint bad..",B0003216GM
"I wore this as an undershirt while traveling.  Underneath a dress shirt, it really trapped heat and caused me to sweat.  Maybe it is OK to wear by itself for work outs, but underneath another garment, you get hot/soggy fast.",B0003216GM
"Lightweight, fast drying, too easy to snag. Be careful around Velcro. Place in plastic bag or other protective covering before placing in suitcase.",B0003216GM
"I have travelled around the globe using these Tee Shirts for everyday wear in warm and tropical climates.  They are very well made, wick away moisture effectively, are quick drying and very light weight.  This Tee Shirt is a basic necessity for travel.",B0003216GM
"Great shirt.  I can layer it under a sport coat for a casual elegant look, work out in it or wear it like a t shirt.  This has replaced like 4 shirts that I would otherwise have to pack when I travel and it dries overbite every time.",B0003216GM
I purchased this for my husband because he was going on an 2 week outdoors trip. I bought him two.  They are lightweight and pack small.  He washed them in the sink and river and they dry fast.  He also wears them fishing and hunting bc the sweat dries fast.  They are expensive but worth the money if you are going to use more than once.  I love their underwear too.,B0003216GM
"I love these shirts and it this price, buy 2.  This shirt is a little snug to fit but that is by design and if you don't like a little snug....Do what I do and get 1 size larger.  Again, I stress it is important to research these shirts or any item you purchase on line.  I would own an ExOfficio over Under Armour or Nike any day.  Yes, they snag but don't where the shirt in a situation where it can get a snag....run, workout but don't rub against objects that are rough...really.  I also read a review stating the shirt is too short.....really....if you are a giant or you have an abnormal torso...or you are too rotund, it will be too short and in that case, you should never purchase on line.  In Short, this is a great shirt!!",B0003216GM
Excellent for traveling!  Wear it for days without smelling bad and washes easily in the hotel sink.,B0003216GM
I love ex officio products have been using them for years highly recommend these T-shirts.,B0003216GM
"A bit more form-fitting/clingy than I'd prefer for outwear (ie. to treat it as a tshirt rather than an undershirt) but I like the material. I'll be buying more boxer briefs, but not more shirts.",B0003216GM
"Having bought other ExOfficio products, I was looking forward to this for my upcoming travel. Unfortunately, this white shirt arrived in damaged form - front fabric already broken off a little. Not sure how the quality control passes this, just returned it.",B0003216GM
"Awesome under shirt. Great for unde a work shirt, or on its own for a work out.",B0003216GM
"Really nice T for hiking/ working out but surely pricey. However you get what you pay for. Would buy again, but hopefully on sale this time. ExOfficio makes good stuff.",B0003216GM
These are amazing. I bought like 7 but tested one pair for a week and I usually smell after a day but these didn't smell till that last day of the week. They dry quickly and truly don't smell. I only wish they made socks as well like these. The underwear are also amazing. I posted a similar review but the underwear do one extra thing for me.,B0003216GM
"Adding to others,a great shirt for sleeping and other uses.",B0003216GM
"I wore this shirt on a trip through India for two weeks.  It was lightweight, easy to wash and quick to dry.  But the fabric started to wear out within a week.",B0003216GM
Very thin but durable material.  Dries quickly.  Fits as expected.,B0003216GM
"I needed a quick dry nightgown for a vacation.  I will be gone for 3 weeks and I intend to pack very lightly.  I started pricing such items and almost fainted at the price.  Soooo, I bought this tee shirt in XXL and will be using it as a nightshirt.  It's my husband's size, and it will revert to him after our vacation.  He's a big fan of ExOfficio stuff, so that's how I became familiar with the products.  Clearly a repurposing of this tee shirt to be a woman's nightshirt isn't for everybody, but it's quite cost effective for any woman who needs a quick dry something or other to sleep in and who doesn't need to be glamorous.",B0003216GM
"It's a little baggier than expected. It would be a great shirt if they would taper in the waist a little. I would say order a size down if you want a closer fit. I ordered my usual size, and it is a little on the billowy side. The material is nice, and other than the loose-ish fit it's a fine shirt.",B0003216GM
Perfect fit. Light and breathable. Washes easily by hand. Dries in half a day.,B0003216GM
Very nice fitting and comfortable T-Shirt.  The shirts wash out easily and dry overnight. Perfect for travel.,B0003216GM
"These shirts are pricey, but Ex Officio's quality is top notch.  I wear these very frequently for hiking.  They are very comfortable, and have held up very well over the years.  They wick dry very quickly, and always feel soft and light against your skin.",B0003216GM
This under t-shirt is cut differently than the colored shirts of the same brand. I ordered another white one to make sure it wasn't an oddity. The white ones were definitely larger through the shoulders and sleeves than the colored ones.,B0003216GM
Had to return it. Has the fit of long underwear. Not what I wanted.,B0003216GM
Meets all expectations And very comfortable.,B0003216GM
"I wish the sleeves were shorter.
Nice quality.",B0003216GM
"I purchased one of these shirts to try out before buying more for an upcoming fly-in fishing trip to Canada.  With a 100 lb. limit per person for clothes, gear and food, I want to take as few of clothes as possible so they need to be able to be hand washed and dry overnight.  This product does dry very quickly when hand washed and wrung out in a towel but the fabric is very delicate and began to unravel and pile after two wearing and washing.  At over $20 per shirt, this is unacceptable.  I will be looking for a different manufacturer.",B0003216GM
Not my favorite!  Seemed to fit a little smaller than expected.  I usually get size med.  Fits a little too tight.,B0003216GM
"Dries quickly on a trip, but you pay big bucks for this feature.  Look for other quick dry products for much less at Wal-Mart and other main stream retailers.  Maybe not the same brand, but other products can do the same thing.",B0003216GM
"I bought these for travel purposes which I haven't done yet. In general they got on the small side and seem to be well made. Pricey, tho.",B0003216GM
Great product but much smaller than expected.,B0003216GM
"Great shirt, I replaced all my undershirts with these.",B0003216GM
"Looks good and feel great.  Dries in a flash so washing at bedtime will be dry by morning.

Perfect for travel.",B0003216GM
Does not absorb...easy to clean..,B0003216GM
"Exactly what I expected /wanted, definitely going to buy more in the near future.",B0003216GM
"I get tired of going to Megalo-Mart and other discount stores to buy thin, skimpy, foreign made T shirts to wear out & about.  I like these Hanes T-shirts.  They are tough and generally well made.  Some of them are even made in the USA.  I grew up in the textile biz and I am glad that there is one NC based company that understands what Americans want.  As long as they make 'em, I'll buy 'em.",B0003216GM
I love these shirts! They feel go and look great.,B0003216GM
Little pricey but good quality.,B0003216GM
Nice and comfortable shirt. However the tagless print on the back of the color becomes dyed into the shirt..,B0003216GM
"i got the undies and i got one of these to go on a week long camping/canoeing trip in minnesota.. big fan, this one shirt was all i needed all week.",B0003216GM
It's hard to go wrong with Exofficio stuff. Good fit. Great versatility. Travel staples,B0003216GM
It has a weird fit and just fits weird altogether. I would not buy again.,B0003216GM
Material is slick like. Dries fast tho.,B0003216GM
Give n go is the best underwear made.  You can wear them in winter or summer and they wick sweat and even look good alone.  Far better than Patagonia underwear.,B0003216GM
all of their products are well manufactured  great for travel,B0003216GM
"Great.takes longer to dry in cool temps.
Feels and fits well.
Will buy more.",B0003216GM
"Very comfortable and appropriate, no sweat.",B0003216GM
Awesome shirt. Wore it for 5 months straight hiking Appalachian Trail.,B0003216GM
"ExOfficio is the self-proclaimed leader in travel undergarmets. After trying this shirt and a pair of their underwear, I think it is mostly hype. I find that UnderArmour heat-gear is quite a bit more comfortable and attractive (no weird checkerboard pattern).

Be warned: even the small size is rather large.",B0003216GM
I use them as a sleep top when traveling.  Can wash an use next night.  Makes packing easier.,B0003216GM
"These will melt in high temp driers, but awesome, fast drying, anti-stink shirts",B0003216GM
"Most comfortable T Shirt I own.
I now use these exclusively and I have White ones as my undershirts for my button down shirts

as a road warrior, I sometimes have to stay longer, so hand washing these and the quick dry come in handy... yeah, well worth it... for comfort and convenience",B0003216GM
"Nice styling and easy to wash out and wear either beneath another shirt, as a outer shirt or sleepshirt.  I give it only three stars due to the fraying around the neck that happened immediately. The fraying is less noticeable than on the gray shirt.  It seems that any stubble causes the collar to fray badly - Exofficio should consider a change to the collar material to something more robust.",B0003216GM
"Very delicate, frayed after a week, not worth it.",B0003216GM
"Of all the ExOfficio products I've tried and liked, this is my least favourite. Apparently I didn't read the fine print or I would have noticed that it said ""slim fit""-when ordering an XXL it's a safe guess that a slim fitting garment isn't what you had in mind. Also, the waist is quite short. Okay, I'm 6'5 but compared to other T shirts of mine that are also XXL, this was a good two inches shorter Then there's the fabric. Same basic material, same quick dry but it would seem to have a larger loop in the knitting process. As you run your fingers over it, there's a definite ""tooth"" that their other products don't have. IF this came more properly sized, I would probably  buy another but as it stands, based on size alone, No. As with all ExOffcio products, the price is somewhat high but one buys these with a purpose, not to be grabbed out of a drawer or from a hanger on your way to play in the back yard. Given their boxers and a couple of pairs of briefs. I can get all the underwear I'm taking to Australia squashed into on shoe....",B0003216GM
"Pricey for an undershirt, but works great on a trip (except you have to do your own laundry). Tends to snag a bit.",B0003216GM
Very comfortable and dries quickly (overnight). Thinner than it appears in the photos.  Snags easily,B0003216GM
"Comfortable, easy clean & dry.  Great for traveling.",B0003216GM
Size is smaller than I expected.  More form fitting than pictured but I still enjoy the comfort and dry-fit of this shirt.  Very nice in warm/sticky weather.,B0003216GM
"Perhaps back in the day this was a unique idea, to make a T shirt out of microfiber for travelers.  But nowadays you can get this type of shirt everywhere, made by everyone.  Your local Macys will have them on sale, sporting goods stores have them, online retailers have them.  So while the concept of a thin, lightweight shirt that you wash and hang overnight still has great value when travelling, you can probably do better elsewhere pricewise.  And it's got a funky raised diamond pattern unlike the other similar shirt I got elsewhere which my wife found odd.",B0003216GM
"It works as advertised. If you sink wash at night and wring it out and roll it up in a towel and stomp on it, it will be dry by morning if in A/C. However, it is very very thin. So it is great as an undershirt but it is essentially see through. So I would not wear just this shirt out of the hotel room.",B0003216GM
"Came in handy,due to the non iron material. I enjoyed wearing it. I live in the tropics. The temperature is hot and humid these days. So this garment serves tis purpose.",B0003216GM
"Finally made the dive to Exofficio after using Uniqlo airism t's as my go to travel shirts. I was thrown off by the nylon fabric since every travel blogger is all about WOOL but it worked great. I wore it for a while, making sure to air it out every night, and didn't really feel like I needed to wash it. It looks like a normal shirt and doesn't have that synthetic shirt shine. The medium fits a LITTLE big. Again, great travel shirt. A bit expensive but worth it if you're trying to travel light.",B0003216GM
"Loved the feel and material of the t-shirt but it will peel like crazy wearing a small day pack if you wear the shirt solo without having anything over it.

I bought this shirt for my trip to South East Asia and within 2 hours of walking around Bangkok with a small day pack on (only had 5 lbs) it was peeling like crazy - around the shoulders as well as the middle of the entire back where the day pack was. It did this so much so that I couldn't wear it for the rest of my trip.

I love ExOfficio products but unfortunately the Give-N-Go Tee was a total let down. Thankfully ExOfficio stands behind their products and they let me return it to them in which they gave me a full credit on a gift card.",B0003216GM
Dries over night and fit great.,B0003216GM
"The feel of this shirt is phenomenal.  Has a nice cool stretchy feel to it.  Was suggested as a good backpacking shirt, but the shirt pills really easily for this purpose.  The shirt is great for just wearing around the house or to work out in, but its long term durability does not look promising compared to the price paid for it.",B0003216GM
"This is the most comfortable tee-shirt I have ever owned. I like it better than 100% cotton.
Hard to explain. I need to experience it in some extreme conditions to finish this review.
It is actually better then wearing nothing........Cool but covering. Breathable, light, soft,
comfortably transparent. Sleek and actually looks better than a cotton.",B0003216GM
"Fits well. Is comfortable and durable. And, you really can wear it for several days while traveling without any odor or funky issues.",B0003216GM
My husband loves this shirt. Raves to anyone who will listen.  The fit is perfect & the material is wrinkle free. Quick drying & packs easily for travel.,B0003216GM
"I tried these out on a three-week trip to Africa with one suitcase. They are very comfortable, and indeed they dry much faster than most other clothing materials. However, they didn't quite dry overnight when hung up in bathrooms with poor circulation. They were dry enough to pack in the suitcase, and when hung up for a second night they were ready to wear the next morning. I got by fine with three shirts used as undershirts. Needed to change the outer shirt only once a week or so. The suitcase was only half full on the way over, so I had room for a number of souvenirs.",B0003216GM
"Different ExOficio styles have different cut. Pay attention when choosing. May find comparing easier on manufacturer's web site. Shirt is comfortable (this one looser fitting than other I bought). Haven,t traveled with it or washed it yet, but expect it will work out well. Material is very stretchy.",B0003216GM
The shirt fit well and is very comfortable.  It was nice to have on my travels.,B0003216GM
"Light weight, clean up and dry overnight as described. They are not too short (or any shorter than my other t-shirts I have purchased).  However, due to the fabric they may ride up.  I don't wear them for the waist though and they do hold up well in the heat.  Excellent for light packers on long trips!",B0003216GM
"very nice shirt, very comfortable, is my husbands 'go to' shirt in this south eastern sticky heat",B0003216GM
Comfortable. Dried really quickly. Great for travel.,B0003216GM
"Lightweight, great for traveling light. Part of being able to travel for 15-20 day trip with one carryon (20"" bag) and a small backpack.",B0003216GM
"Best travel T-shirts I have ever wore.  You can dress up a sport coat for evening wear.  Wear it all day, wash it out when you get to the hotel room and wear it the next day. If it gets hot, this T-shirt will breath and keep you cool.  Bought 2 about 5 years ago and wore them out.",B0003216GM
"Easy wash, easy dry.  Just what I needed.",B0003216GM
"Has all the problems found on other reviews.  Material snags and runs just from lightly brushing up against something.  Neck doesn't stay flat.  Thought that with all the reviews to this effect, that ExOfficio would have corrected it by now.  I'd try another brand if I were you.",B0003216GM
Very nice. I wear as an undershirt for work and training. Very fast drying and cool,B0003216GM
"Love this stuff-totally comfy and light, but don't even think about drying it in the dryer. Fits loosely.",B0003216GM
"I love the Give N Go boxer briefs, so I was hoping this shirt would be similar.  Like the boxers, the shirt is comfortable and breaths well.  Unfortunately, it doesnt last more than a few wearings.
After just 3 wearings and washing it according to manufacturer instructions, it was horrible frayed all over.  I figured this was a fluke, since the underwear is so great.
I exchanged the shirt for another one, and that one only lasted two washings.  With the 2nd shirt, I only washed it on gentle cold cycle and air dried it.  However, after just the 2nd wash, it is starting to fray again.

I don't understand how ExOfficio can sell such a fragile shirt.  I also cant fathom how it has so many good reviews. Ill return it again and stick with underarmor from now on.",B0003216GM
It is a great undershirt that he raves about for comfort the coolness and the fact the undershirt breaths.,B0003216GM
"The travel undies are a suitcase space saver. They do not always drip-dry overnight,as promised, but a quick minute with the hotel hair dryer and they are good to go. When we travel it's usually three weeks away, with little or no access to laundry facilities. So a nigh-time wash in the bathroom sink, then we hang them on a hanger in the shower, and by morning, we are good to go. When we have to pay by the pound for our suitcases and three weeks worth of men's undies comes is just too many pounds. We take three pair of these wonderful travel undies and we are good to go.",B0003216GM
Best shirt. I wear it all the time to yoga and spin class,B0003216GM
Great tee shirts--especially for travel.  Easy to hand wash and and dries quickly.,B0003216GM
The shirts worked out great. I recommend  having two shirts on trips over a few days. Dry per instructions and all will go well. The shirts run on the very smaller size so I recommend going a size or two larger.,B0003216GM
"Frays like crazy. I like the products of this company generally, but this shirt is completely frayed after just a few uses. I am not hard on shirts.",B0003216GM
I lived on 3 of these for 2 weeks while traveling.  They are extremely comfortable and dried within 24 hours in a damp bathroom.,B0003216GM
"After having great luck with the ExOfficio briefs, I had high hopes for these t-shirts.  Unfortunately that isn't the case...

Normally I wear a medium Hanes-type t-shirt under my dress shirts or a large t-shirt if its to be worn alone for sports activities or bumming around.  I frequently travel  to hot, muggy parts of Asia and hoped these would be a great alternative to bulky cotton t-shirts to wear under my suits.  Unfortunately in a medium size they are too loose - the neck looks rumpled (even after light ironing) and they just don't have a good enough appearance peeking up through the open neck of a dress shirt.  At $30 each I hoped to then repurpose them as stand-alone t-shirts for working out or wearing as a casual throw-on during off-times.  To my disappointment, they fail this purpose as well (at least in the white color) as they are so thin you can see your ""nipples"" and chest hair through the sheer material of the shirt.  Yeck.

So now I have $60 worth of useless t-shirts.  Back to the drawing board.",B0003216GM
"First, I love ExOfficio underwear. It's the best thing out there. If you don't have any, go buy some. You'll never go back.

I bought this shirt because it was made from the same stuff as the underwear. The shirt is comfortable, but it looks like you're wearing a mesh shirt. Which shouldn't come as a surprise, because that's what the underwear look like too. I guess I thought it would be a little different. It's still a solid shirt.

The XXL is a little more snug than the XXL Columbia or Mountain Hardware make.",B0003216GM
"Worthy of the ExOfficio name. I've loved their boxer briefs and recently purchased two shirts for a two week trip. Washed easily in the sink and dried easily overnight. I use them as undershirts, and they fit to size. I typically will wear large in a t-shirt (the review says Hazel, but I'm the husband), but wear medium in undershirts. I'll be purchasing more.",B0003216GM
"Great for travel and easy to wash and pack. Doesn't require much space in suit case or travel gear. Also,  feels more comfortable than cotton under garments.",B0003216GM
"I am probably going to replace most of my undershirts with these things. I love the briefs underwear and now I love the shirts. Super-comfortable and the sweat dries out of them very quickly. They get a little stinky but maybe that's just me. :-) Just brought some to Europe and definitely wore more than one day. Only issue was I washed a white with some colors and it turned grey, probably my fault though it was hot water. Seem to run a little small, I ordered a large and had to exchange for XL.",B0003216GM
"This item is great for traveling. Quick dry and light weight. Feel good next to skin.
I do not like neck line finish. Sleeves are too long to wear with my short sleeve shirts.
Can not wear alone because it is so thin and see- through.
If you wear it under  long sleeve shirts, no problem.
If you are a young with  a shaped body, you will enjoy wearing it alone.",B0003216GM
"The fit was ok, maybe I should have gotten a size smaller, but using this as an undershirt with a short-sleeve button down shirt didn't work out... the sleeves on this shirt kept popping out.

The other issue was the collar, it didn't last long before it wrinkled up and has that bacon-look now.",B0003216GM
"Used this as an undershirt on a business trip to India. Normally I only like cotton fabric but since traveling in hot weather, looking for something that would stay breathable and keep me dry as possible. This did the trick. There is a bit of a waffle pattern, but it feels cool as can be expected. The shirt can be washed in hotel room and dried overnight. The sizing seems slightly small to me, but not overly so.",B0003216GM
"I bought this for my husband to wear hiking, as we thought it would be quick drying if we hiked in the rain.  The first time he wore it his Camelback straps caused the fabric to ""pill"" under all the straps.  So now he can only wear it as a scruffy hiking shirt with a backpack over the ruined areas.  Very disappointing.  I have several other ex-officio products that have worked well for hiking (underwear, long sleeved shirt) - but I wouldn't recommend this product.",B0003216GM
Every Ex-Officio product that I've purchased has been great.  They are light weight and the fabric is breathable.  They take up no room in the suitcase.  They dry very quickly and always hold their shape.  They'll continue to be one of my travel partners for years to come.,B0003216GM
"To start with, I've ordered and used other ExOfficio products and been very happy with them. Unfortunately, I'm disappointed in this shirt for several reasons. First, the promise of being able to wash it and wear it again while traveling didn't work. I washed it in the hotel, rinsed it, and let it dry overnight. The next day, I noticed a very funky odor coming from the shirt. No good. It only seems to get clean from machine washing.

I'm also disappointed in the durability of the neck. I realize the neck of most crew-neck t-shirts will eventually get stretched and wear out over time. The problem is that I've worn this shirt 4 times and the neck is already curling and stretched out. Save your money and look elsewhere with this one.",B0003216GM
"Always wanted to try the material of the clothes, and I wasn't disappointed! Quick drying effect exceeding one's expectations so good",B0003216GM
"This is the smallest XXL shirt I can remember getting.  I do have wide shoulders and a large chest and back but still, smaller than most XXL shirts I have tried.  That being said, it is a very thin, lightweight, and comfortable shirt.  I will update this review if the durability is not good.",B0003216GM
We are traveling to Europe and want to take as little bulk as possible.  I wanted to try these T shirts to see if they were comfortable and were easily washed and if the dry time was minimal.  They are!  I will be purchasing another 2 to include during our trip.  The mens briefs are some of the most comfortable I have ever had and will be buying those also.,B0003216GM
"They seem to run a little smaller than some...he has a thicker chest (muscular, especially the upper chest) so it's a little snugger than most size larges, but it still looks really good. He only wears non-cotton, and this is breathable and washes well.",B0003216GM
"I really like the ExOfficio Tee shirts and briefs! One thing to know about whites, though: This is one case where the ""wash with like colors only"" warning on the label REALLY matters! If you are buying these as underwear to wear under a dress shirt where some of the undershirt may show, and you need it to be white, if you have washed these with any other color clothes, they will not be white. These cannot be bleached (they are expensive enough that I haven't tried, but the label says not to), and will take on other colors very easily. After washing with other colors, mine have turned gray and ""granny ecru"" colors. Again, these are underwear, and color shouldn't really matter unless they can be seen where white matters.",B0003216GM
"Like the underwear, I bought some shirts for travel but am transitioning over to these completely.  They're just SOOO comfortable and breathable.  Expensive, but reasonably affordable luxury.",B0003216GM
"Fits too tight for the size. For some reason, it has a lot of static cling to it. I was trying to find or duplicate the ExOfficio Exo Dry Short sleeve t-shirt, which I can no longer seem to find in Black-- this shirt does not do it. The Exo Dry is the bomb and has lasted me over 2 years and many countries of travel.",B0003216GM
I will get more of these.  They are little pricey for a tshirt but they are more than a tshirt.  They are great for traveling.  They are great for workout shirts.  They are more durable than regular cotton tshirts.,B0003216GM
"I bought this for my husband for a trip we took to South America. I wish that I had bought a few more. He just loved them. We live in a  hot humid climate and they will be perfect in the summer. Great to travel with, we washed it out in the sink and hung dry. Only took a couple of hours to dry.",B0003216GM
Tee runs true to size. Great feel. Breaths and keeps you from getting that stuffy feeling. Nice base layer for cool days.,B0003216GM
"a bit expensive, but  great for the traveler, light weight for packing and fast drying.  lightens the suitcase load and keeps clean available speedily.",B0003216GM
Interesting t.  Too small in chest.  If I had ordered Xlarge the chest might have been ok but the waist too large.  Ok as an undershirt but not as a casual wear T.,B0003216GM
The shirt fits well and does dry quickly so it is great for travel where space and weight are at issue.,B0003216GM
"The shirt and underwear are wonderful. It wears well and dries fast.  Cannot get enough of them, will be buying more!",B0003216GM
"I simply get hot!  In the sun, wearing a suit, doing nothing!  I always feel like I'm hot.

I wear these as undershirts.  I've tried the dri tech Nike, Under Armour etc.  They just didn't work as well.  They had polyester and said they ""wick"" moisture.

This shirt seems to do it so much better.  I think it has to do with the weave as much as the material.  It is silky soft.  The weave is hard to explain but imagine a waffle weave shirt.  I think this is cooler because it has small ridges that are really the main contact with your skin.  So unlike a flat shirt it doesn't just absorb the moisture.  It has almost pockets where air is the only thing In contact.  The areas in contact with skin then draw moisture to the shirt and it evaporates right away.  It's my go to undershirt.  Keeps it's shape.  Very comfortable.  Longer and stays tucked in.

The only negative is they have no tag and the printing that I take for granted indicating the back of the shirt washes off after 5 or 6 washes.  I've put it on backwards more than a couple of times.  Its easy to know when this happens because it feels tight across the chest.

I solved my problem with a super small sharpie dot just on the inside of the collar.

Do yourself a favor and just try one.  In any retail store they run about $50.  So finding them on amazon around $20 was like buy one get one free.  An absolute steal!!",B0003216GM
These are very comfortable shirts that pack easily.  They are just what I was looking for.  They wash and dry quickly.,B0003216GM
"I ordered two as a trial; seeking a good travel T
I gave them away to good will as they do not stay tucked in for anything.
Would not repeat nor recommend",B0003216GM
I have bought these (seven in total) from Amazon in the past and they are absolutely superb. The last order I placed was in mid-January and the product was not as described and not like the earlier ones I purchased.  I do not recommend buying this product because it does not match the description and is in no way as good as the early ones I purchased,B0003216GM
This is a very comfortable shirt and a good addition to my collection of similar shirts. I find that am choosing to wear this one more often than the others though.,B0003216GM
"Most comfortable underwear on the planet.  First tried the product while traveling through France.  So impressed with the product that, when I returned home, swapped out every T that I owned for this product.  Will never go back to cotton!",B0003216GM
I rate this shirt 5 stars because it looks really nice. My husband said he felt very comfortable. it won't stick to your body when sweating.,B0003216GM
I brought both these and Tee's and the same lowers to Italy with me in order to cut down on the amount of luggage I had to pack.  I had 3 complete sets and as advertised wash them at night and you can wear them the next day.  I currently have them packed for another trip.  Great where space is concerned.  You can go round the world with 3 pairs of these.,B0003216GM
"This has been so helpful for all of our outdoor camping and backpacking adventures. They are light weight, wash and dry fast and fit true to size. Great purchase for the outdoor adventurer.",B0003216GM
"Wish I could give these six stars.
Although the white shirts are a bit too sheer for me to wear as outer t-shirts, there is NOTHING in the world like them as undershirts.  I live in Texas and my body's engine tends to run ""hot"" to begin with, so although I wear dress shirts every day, I never, ever, wore a t-shirt under anything - not even if I was going to be sedentary in the air conditioning all day.  When I found these shirts, I completely changed my ways.  I wear them year round, and sometimes even wear them under other t-shirts.
As for travel... I took month-long trip this summer covering 8 countries and 3 climate zones (northern Europe to South Africa), and had to carry everything in a single backpack.  I carried 3 of these, because they can be washed by hand and they dry out overnight, which seriously extended the wash-life of my outer shirts.  And, while I'm at it, the ExOfficio underwear is an even more fantastic product than these.  MUCH, MUCH more comfortable than cotton, because they keep you cooler and dryer, and GREAT for travel (one of the few products where ads that seem over-stated turn out to be true -  I literally only needed 3 pair for the month-long trip, because they are so easy to wash in the sink and dry out overnight).
I'm a BIG fan.",B0003216GM
I'm between sizes and I accidentally ordered this as if it was a normal T-shirt.  If you're the same as myself (between sizes typically) order smaller than larger.,B0003216GM
"I have for many years worn the highest quality cotton under-shirts.  I live in a humid climate, travel over-seas a lot and I sweat profusely.  I found over the last few years, that the cotton under-shirts more and more uncomfortable because they don't dry quickly and they don't wick away the sweat.  This became more evident when I started travelling more.  Sitting on a plane for 8-10 hours in a leather seat is not the greatest thing ... the sweat gets trapped and I was walking off airplanes feeling terrible.

So my girl-friend introduced me to technical fabrics (i.e. those used for athletic clothing).  I tried a produce from under-armour.  It wasn't much better than my Hanes or Kirkland Tees.

I was at the same time hunting for a wicking fabric for my under-wear (to counter the heat rash that I had gotten used to getting after every trip) and after lots of reading found the ExOfficio brand of products.  I bought a couple of pairs and used them on trips.  They were great.  I came back and found out they have these Tee-shirts as well.  I have now replaced all my Tees and Underwear (even for daily use) with products from ExOfficio.  I've got a half a dozen of these shirts and half a dozen of their under-wear.

Oh what a change their products have resulted in my day-to-day life.  Heat rash is gone.  Discomfort gone.  If you are a man who sweats profusely, this produce is for you.",B0003216GM
"The fit on the Tee is great, not too baggy-not too snug, just right.  I bought this for a 10 day trip to Ireland and it worked out great.  I only took one other Tee just in case.  I laundered it each night and it was ready to go in the morning.  I love it and would recommend it for any type of traveling.",B0003216GM
"I find this shirt way too big to use as an undershirt.  I have a wide torso (5'9"" 170lbs athletic) and this fits fine as an outer shirt.  It's too loose and baggy to wear as an undershirt.  I would size down if that's your intended use of this shirt.",B0003216GM
"The collar winkles/scrunches after moderate use. Fit around the shoulders and chest is not quite right.  It is a comfortable shirt, just needs a little more refinement.",B0003216GM
"I wear these, I have 4, under sweaters or by themselves. Always keep you comfortable whether its hot or cold.",B0003216GM
"I decided to try these undershirts because I really liked the underwear and other ExOfficio products I have tried in the past. Frankly, this one doesn't measure up. I like the fabric, but the fit is poor. It does not hang well and, more importantly, is not very long so it pulls out of my slacks too easily. Bottom line is that this product doesn't measure up, so the search for a good travel undershirt continues.",B0003216GM
"On the road, this can be washed in a sink, rinsed in the shower, rolled in a towel, and be wearable by morning.",B0003216GM
The fit is good and the fabric is interesting.  Kind of a stretchy material with plenty of airflow.  I actually like it as a sleeping shirt best.,B0003216GM
"I am writing this review because I have read so many other reviews on other products that I have bought on Amazon, that I hope I am contributing toward a little pay back and thank you for those of you who have taken the time to review items.  So here is my humble opinion.

I am a male, 6 1, weighing in around 205 lbs., fairly athletic.  It started with my buying 40 to 50 pairs of underwear many years ago and just rotated through them, wearing one pair a day and doing my wash every 2-3 weeks.  Making sure I put the newly washed in the back of the pile.  I wanted to have enough underwear so I didn't run out between washes.  Sometime in 2010, I started buying Hanes underwear.  A six pack at Wal-Mart, a six pack at Target, etc., but never opening them.  Till one day in 2011, I threw out everything I had and started with the all new Hanes (some being a year old, but never worn), which were bought over the course of a year at various retailers.

In October, 2012, I bought one set of the 5 underwear brands listed here (except the Hanes).  I rotated through them in no particular order. Every time I did the wash, I put them up in front of the Hanes and started wearing them first.  I would like to buy 30 pairs of one of these brands, but none of them (for the price) really excited me enough to do that, except one.  I certainly will get a few more pairs of the ExOfficio, which I really like but at $16+ per pair, I cant get carried away.  So I believe I will buy a few more sets of other underwear and continue this study.

  Interestingly Hanes makes their underwear in at least 4 different countries, but none of them really hold up.  I don't remember the prices because I bought them at different stores at different times during the year.  Over the course of the year and a half that I wore them, they just didn't hold up.  The band is shot, elasticity is going and its wavy and uncomfortable and worst of all, the crotch area doesnt do its job of holding things in place. 2 stars.

Hanes Made in Vietnam
75% cotton, 25% polyester; gray waist band w/darker gray line and HANES repeated.
Worn waist band, little waves in the back and side areas.  Crotch doesnt cover area, things hang out.

Hanes Made in Vietnam
100% cotton; gray waist band w/darker gray line and HANES repeated.
Micro fuzz balls in material.  Worn waist band, little waves in the back band area.  Crotch doesnt cover area, things hang out.

Hanes Made in Dominica Republic
100% cotton; dark blue waist band w/darker gray line and HANES repeated.
Slightly stiffer waist band than other Hanes, material seems a little heavier.  Worn waist band.  Crotch still doesnt cover area.

Hanes Made in India
100% cotton; gray waist band w/darker gray line and HANES repeated.
Worn waist band, little waves in the back, front and side area.  Crotch doesnt cover area.

  ExOfficio Men's Give-N-Go Sport Brief,Black,Large  $16.40  ($16.40 each)  5 stars
94% Nylon?, 6% Spandex, made in China (the labels in 2 pairs are totally unreadable (white out), and in the third pair, I think it says nylon, but its really hard to read with magnifying glass and flash light.  (I don't use bleach and seriously, I would never look at the labels except to do this review, so its not a negative).
Love these, great quality, fits well, still looks good and holding up fine,  But at this price, I now save them for travel only.  It beats the heck out of carrying 15 pairs of underwear for a two week trip (one a day, whether I need it or not!)  So Im sold on these.  I bought one T-shirt and Im going to ask Santa for a couple more this year for Christmas along with a few more pairs of underwear.  Absolutely the best.

  Dockers Men's 4-Pack Fly Front Brief,Multi,Large  $19.00  ($4.75 each) 3  stars
100% cotton, made in Thailand.
Frumpy looking, not much in style, but good quality,  The material seems heavier than any of the others.  It will be interesting to see how they hold up during the next year.

  Hugo Boss Men's 3 Pack Traditional Brief, Black, Large  $18.38  ($6.12 each)  4 stars
100% cotton, made in Bangladesh.  Quality seems good, the band is starting to lose its elasticity and starting to show waves.  Rides a little low for me, but not as low as the Adidas brand.  Good fit.

  Calvin Klein Men's Basic Brief, Black, Size 36, 3-Pack  $20.63 ($6.87 each) 3 stars
100% cotton, made in Thailand.  This has a white band which seems to be holding up okay after a year.  There is a small hole, near the seam in the middle of the garment.  Im just not happy with what it looks like for the price Im paying.  Ill see how they do during the next year.

  Adidas Men's Athletic Stretch 2-Pack Sport Brief,Black/Black,Large  $18.00  ($9.00 each) 4 stars
90% Cotton, 10% Spandex, made in Indonesia.  Good quality, holding up very nicely, crotch area still covers correctly.  The only thing I don't like is its a sports cut and they ride too low for me.  They are not comfortable for me to wear unless that is all Im wearing around the house, but the quality is good, price a little high.",B0003216GM
"Once the rain all day, the sun quit, I used duct blowing, just fifteen minutes on the whole didI love it",B0003216GM
"THIS IS THE SECOND ONE OF THESE WE HAVE PURCHASED! LOVE THIS FABRIC! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
WILL PROBABLY BUY MORE!",B0003216GM
The shirt is exactly what I was looking for as an undershirt for traveling.  Only possible improvement might be to make a V-neck version.  I intend to take three on my cruise and wash them every other night since they are quick drying.,B0003216GM
"Be careful buying and wearing this company's product: the shirt felt great until it was worn, then it started to pill.  Pilling became even worse after washing",B0003216GM
"The shirt dries overnight and can be worn each day, clean, unless you're in a humid climate, in which case take two. They're not as comfortable as a cotton tee. My one complain was the colors available; they're drab.",B0003216GM
"Purchased this to use as an undershirt.  The cut is pretty boxy, definitely don't get these if you're looking for something with an athletic cut.  The white color is also more see through than they appear in the product images.  These appear to be made of the same material as their popular give-n-go boxers.  They do dry pretty fast.",B0003216GM
Used this product on a three week trip to Italy.  Was able to wash and dry almost every other night. Product performed.  I would recommend it to anybody traveling with limited luggage space.,B0003216GM
"I sweat.  Sorry to say this but I do.  So in Mexico, in October, especially between noon and early evening, it gets dam hot down there.  And I literally wore this during that time frame because it dried quick, and kept me cool even while sweating, none of my other regular shirts performed as well as this one did.",B0003216GM
"Unfortunately I took to heart some of the well-intended reviews for this shirt and ended up ordering too large a size for the purpose I needed these undershirts for.  So now I have moisture a set of moisture wicking undershirts that are baggy like a casual t-shirt, which makes them a bit useless as a second-skin style undershirt for wicking sweat away and preventing chafing while doing heavy exersion with equipment strapped over the shoulders and chest.  Oh well.",B0003216GM
"I read a few reviews who said these are a 'tight fit' so I bought a large.  It is large and so I reordered a couple of mediums and they fit perfectly.
I am pretty active in my job and these shirts make the best undershirts as they let me breathe without anything sticking to me.
Can't be beat.  I just wish they were cheaper!",B0003216GM
"While rather expensive, these briefs are excellent. They are easily washed at night and dry for the next morning. They wear well and look nice.",B0003216GM
"The shirt fits well and looks great. At least it looked great when I got it - then I wore it once, while traveling, and found that my bag had a tiny sliver of exposed Velcro, which defaced big chunks of the shirt.  Now the top of the shirt looks nice, and the bottom looks like a cat's scratching post.

Aside from that - it wears very well, even for long times (e.g. 33 hours of airplanes & airports & hot/humid climates) and achieves the promise of not getting overly stinky and being easy to wash in a hotel sink.

I'd recommend it, except for the fact that it's so delicate.",B0003216GM
"I wanted a t-shirt quick to dry, light weight and takes up little room in my carry on luggage, I got all three wishes",B0003216GM
"its awesome!!!!!!! it's a very comfortable fit......I like it very,very much and I will definitely purchase more if these tee shirts when I completely wear out the old ones. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)",B0003216GM
Product arrived promptly. I was impressed by how light the t-shirts were and how much less space they took compared to my cotton t's.,B0003216GM
"Great material and workmanship and would highly recommend this tee to anyone.
Will definitely purchase more in both crew and v-neck",B0003216GM
Originally I bought this as an undershirt that I could use for traveling.  I liked it so much I ordered some more and wear them everyday.  They have lost some of their smoothness over time and I have noticed some of the little balls that sometime accumulate on clothing but nothing that would cause any issues.,B0003216GM
"Tee, A little too snug.  Especially in the arm pits.  Otherwise the product is a great product.  I have been wearing ExOfficio Mens  T-Shirts since 2002..  They are great for travelling, and every day ware.

RA.",B0003216GM
"I also took 2 of these t-shirts with me when I traveled out of the country.  They are comfortable and wash well.  The only downside is that they wrinkle terrible.  However, it was easy to fix with some Downey wrinkle spray.",B0003216GM
"I have ordered the ExOfficio underwear for my husband before, so I decided to order a t-shirt as well.  The shirt fit well and seemed to help with the sweat from wearing his bullet-proof vest which he is currently wearing in July in August.  Of course, he still sweat, but he said that the shirt made him more comfortable than normal.  This seemed to be a good buy and I will certainly order more t-shirts of this brand.",B0003216GM
The picture shows a man wearing a loose T-shirt. The one I got was like cling wrap. It will be tight like athletic under armor.,B0003216GM
Bought these 5 shirts because I had purchased boxers from Orvis previously.  The Amazon price was too good to pass up.  The undershirts perform great.  They are cool.  They can be hand washed on trips and they come clean and dry quickly.,B0003216GM
"Seems a bit large; however, I'm afraid the medium would be a bit snug. More after we take it on the road.",B0003216GM
"Love this shirt for my husband who travels to hot, hotter or hottest India. Works well as a T shirt or undershirt.",B0003216GM
"I like these shirts but will not buy anymore.  For the price they should hold up better.  This one came with a snag and hanging thread already in it.  Awful.  For some reason there is no way to contact this company on the Amazon site unlike others.  Don't buy it, too much, and too easily torn and snagged.",B0003216GM
"Bought this for a trip in Costa Rica thinking I could get by just a few micro-fiber items like shirt, socks, underwear.

Was great for everything EXCEPT the idea  you could wash and dry them overnight, It was just too humid. Only worked if I could find a high-speed fan or A/C I could drape them over",B0003216GM
I recently lost weight and was waiting for my three year old large size to wear out. It never did so I bought the medium for a perfect fit.,B0003216GM
"I use as under shirts only and they are great. Like other items the first ones were given to me as a gift. I will buy more.

Bobby",B0003216GM
Great t-shirt for travel. It is very light weight and comfortable and yet does not feel flimsy. It also dries overnight when washing  in a hotel bathroom sink. I highly recommend this product.,B0003216GM
I had purchased the ExOfficio boxer briefs and found them to be so comfortable that i had to try the tee. I was not disappointed.  The fabric has superior sweat management thus it always feels dry on the skin.,B0003216GM
"Like many guys that are Medium/Large dilemma - Medium is too tight but Large is too baggy, a large of this shirt is perfect.",B0003216GM
"I have used one shirt per a lot continuos days, it's so good, you can wash it, and in few couples of minutes will be dry.. hehe perfect to travel, sizes are so accurate like exofficio describes in its web page.",B0003216GM
"This shirt does exactly what is described.  It works just fine as an undershirt, washes out easily in the hotel sink, and is completely dry by morning.  I tried a different ""quick-drying"" band and found them to be damp in the morning, especially at the collar.  However, I would not recommend it as an outer shirt except for running or visiting the hotel fitness center.  It is prone to wrinkling--no problem when used as an undershirt, but not good for an outer garment.  So pack two of these and free up space in your suitcase, but only the space you used for undershirts.",B0003216GM
"Bought for travel but will use them all the time as they are very comfortable, and we live in a hot climate, so the wicking ability is perfect! M",B0003216GM
"cool and soft
dry very fast ,comfortable in hot weather.
just love it
and 9.99 is a very reasonable price I think",B0003216GM
"I have several of these that I have used for years. The quality is excellent and when washed in sink while I am on out of town trips, it dries fast. Breathability is excellent.",B0003216GM
Expensive but worth it. Shirt is very comfortable. It is easy to wash by hand and dries very fast. I purchased 2 shirts to take on a trip to Switzerland but like it so much I want to wear it everyday.,B0003216GM
"Performs as advertised. Great comfort but wrinkles easily - perhaps best as a base layer, not as a warm weather top.",B0003216GM
"The product description states, ""this tee is odor resistant"".  Not true.  First time I wore it as an undershirt, I sweat a little bit and I could smell it through my dress shirt.  It's very comfortable though but not worth $31.",B0003216GM
"This light tee is very comfortable, nice fit, and is light and breathable.  As with other ExOfficio products I have purchased, I am very satisfied with this product.",B0003216GM
"I am really disappointed in the Tee from ExOfficio.  The boxers are amazing, comfortable and seem to be durable.  The Tee shirt pilled around the neck after only 5 wearings.  I have purchased 2 and am returning them to Amazon.  For the cost, they should be better quality.",B0003216GM
"I love this underwear for travel.  I can wash it in a sink, squeeze it out, roll it in a towel tightly (I usually sit on it), and then hang the shirt.  It will be dry in the morning.  I've just come back from 3 weeks on the road carrying 3 of these t-shirts (and the matching boxer briefs), and saved a fortune in laundry fees.",B0003216GM
"Pros:
-Absorbs sweat
-Dries *kinda* fast

Cons:
-Gets ruined easily; backpack straps, anything velcro, they will tear at the material and ruin it REALLY quickly.
-Though it absorbs sweat, that sweat SHOWS
-Doesn't look good. Definitely not a shirt you can wear out. (IMHO)

Definitely wouldn't buy a shirt with this material again.",B0003216GM
"I travel for a living ... Pilot for major airline.
ExOfficio T's and underwear are the greatest for travel.
They are easy to pack and can easily be washed on the road.",B0003216GM
"These were purchased for a trip, and although the fabric dried quickly as expected, we were very disappointed to find that the long length of the sleeves made it impossible to wear them with a short sleeved shirt!  This is just plain bad design.",B0003216GM
This shirt was perfect for packing light to go to Europe!  I'd reccomend it to anyone who travels and wants to go with just one carry on!,B0003216GM
"I really enjoy the way the give and go fabric feels. I purchased these shirts in white to wear under dress shirts with a suit, but also wear them by themselves on the weekend. If you intend to wear this shirt on its own, keep in mind that the material is pretty sheer.

When I travel, I can get by with just a couple shirts by washing and drying them in the sink. This saves a ton of room in my suitcase that otherwise would have been taken up by cotton shirts and undershirts. They will dry overnight in all but the most humid climates.

One other lesson learned, is to purchase several sizes up. The length of the shirt is pretty short, so while the large fits fine, it is a tad too short, so recently I have been purchasing the XLs. This also gives it a more casual fit for when I just wear the shirt on its own.",B0003216GM
"I bought three tees previously for a long trip, it works great. Dries pretty fast compared to normal cotton and feels comfortable too. Recently, I bought two more. Its an overall practical tee for travelling and even normal wear.

But, one thing about this product material is that its kinda weak against abrasion and certain parts became a little fluffy over a time. Not a big deal, but something to take note if you know you are gonna wear it out. Same goes for the briefs.",B0003216GM
"Great t-shirt except it balls up and has wear issues. The material is great. I could almost overlook the weird wear issues except it's very expensive. I like plain black t-shirts and this one became my favorite for about two weeks. Then it started to look worn out around the waist area, balling up and looking generally unkempt. If it kept it's condition I would buy about 30 of these, one for each day of the month. Maybe there is another black t that will get into 'exclusive black t' territory.",B0003216GM
"I am not a fan of regular, cotton t-shirts.  They hold perspiration and odors - although inexpensive - there are better options.  I have used this shirt numerous times since purchasing it and have enjoyed the fast-drying fabric and lack of odor-holding of the garment.  The only complaint I have is the collar seems to be a bit on the ""ragged"" side.  I don't pull on it and have hand-washed the shirt exclusively, but the collar just doesn't look very good.  While it may not be important to most people it is the one negative thing I personally noticed.  Otherwise, besides the premium price, this is a great t-shirt to wear!",B0003216GM
"I ordered two of these shirts before leaving for Prague for 8 days. The first thing I noticed is that the shirt has some heft to it. It is well-made and very comfortable. It also feels warm when worn underneath a sweater or shirt. I did wash these shirts a few times while on the trip. It took a good 12 hours to dry, but that depends on how well you wring it out. This shirt does not wrinkle easily and looks good. So I am satisfied.",B0003216GM
If you want the best wicking shirt buy this one. Great product and beats all other makers in this type of shirt.,B0003216GM
"I purchased a couple of these t shirts for trip but had to return them.  I have no doubt the material is excellent (I own some of their boxer briefs) when it comes to wicking moisture, but the fit was really weird.  I'm 6' with a slender build and found the sleeves to be really long while the length was way too short.  There's no way it would stay tucked in as an undershirt, so I returned them.  Perhaps, a large would have been better lengthwise but the sleeves would have fit like a 3/4 sleeve baseball jersey.  I like retro but not that much..haha.",B0003216GM
"Great fabric: keeps you cool, doesn't smell, dries quickly. But the cut could use some improvement. The collar touches the front of my throat and not the nape (and no, I'm not wearing it backwards...). And it could be cut a bit sportier - just look at IceBreaker for a first-rate cut. Good sleeve length and size.",B0003216GM
"This shirt does exactly what is advertised.  I play golf and work in the golf industry.  Often I travel and need many undershirts.  I tried this tee when I went to Sandestin, Florida recently where the humidity was awful.  This tee kept me dry all day and at the end of the day I washed it in the sink and it was ready to go the next morning.  I was impressed.  Only the sizing was off - I bought a small based not on the information provided, but rather based on the fact that I tried one on at a local store.  I wear Medium in everything, but small was just about too big for me.  Sleeves were a little long, but ok.  Highly recommend it.",B0003216GM
"I have two of these shirts.  I cannot say how fantastic they are.  Whether at work (never let them see you sweat) or traveling (who wants to sweat during pictures?), I don't want to wear anything else.  Gradually, I will be replacing my normal cotton undershirts with these.  Love them.",B0003216GM
I've pretty much switched my entire underwear to ExOfficio over the past year b/c of how amazing they perform when I was traveling.  I bartend 6 nights a week and these babies stand the test of time and wear.  When the shirts came out I figured why not!  Just put it on today and it feels amazing!  The same magic material for my upper body.  Just ordered 3 more shirts.  Get some.,B0003216GM
This T-shirt was great for a 16 day business trip I took to 3 different countries. Because of difficult connections I had to carry-on my luggage. I brought 2 Ex Officio T's and 2 boxers for the entire trip. They dry very quickly  after you wash them in the hotel room and they are quite comfortable. The only issue I had with them is that they are not as breathable as cotton. So they can be a bit warm under the covers if you also use them to sleep in.,B0003216GM
"These t-shirts are probably the best shirt I have found to wear as an undershirt. They are thin enough to not add hardly any bulk underneath any shirt I wear. And because of the material, and proabably the way it woven or whatever, they are very cool. Any amount of wind goes right through, which is great for undershirts. And they dry really fast, you can easily hand wash them anywhere and wring it out and hand it up and it will be dry at least overnight easily I'd not a couple hours. Bottom line, best undershirts out there.",B0003216GM
"Comfortable, nice fit, quick-drying - what's not to like?
I love all the ExOfficio products.  Never cheap, but always well-made, so they're worth the cost.
Recommended!",B0003216GM
"I have bought two of these tees now to try them out as a means for reducing luggage weight on multi week overseas trips.  I have tested the washing by hand and drying overnight and it works as advertised.  The tees have a good feel when being worn.  If you wash with other items beware that the fabric may ""pick"" due to buttons or zippers.  Overall I am a fan and have purchased two types of the boxer/undershorts to try and am very happy with those.  Actually, they are lightweight and great for warm temperatures or for wear during active periods.  A great product.",B0003216GM
"Comfortable, dries quickly as advertized and good quality construction.  And it looks good under an regular shirt or worn by itself.",B0003216GM
I bought these for a two week trip to Europe.  They saved a ton of space over traditional cotton tees.  They were easy to wash in a sink and came relatively clean (nothing like machine washing though).  The downsides are: (1) they trap body heat initially and it was very warm when you first put them on. (2) The collar wrinkles and looks bad.,B0003216GM
"Perfect fit, i normally wear x-large t-shirts, but this large size is just right. Quality product, and it was less than @ REI. Wore it a couple times then washed it. Had it hang dry only in the garage, took about 6 hours to dry. Got a couple of these for an upcoming Europe trip.",B0003216GM
"Veeeery comfortable, great wicking, quick drying, good odor control, easy to wash & air dry. Expensive, but perfect for x-light camping & hiking.",B0003216GM
"I'm not as pleased with these as I was pleased with the boxer briefs of the same brand. These aren't wearing as well, and they don't seem as tough. After purchasing the underwear, I purchased more of them. I will not be purchasing more of the t-shirts.",B0003216GM
"I bought a few of these shirts for a 3 week trip to South America.  These shirts are really great!  They are made of a waffled ""dri-fit""-type of material.  They breathe incredibly well and don't stick to you even when sweaty.  The material itself is good, but is more snag-prone than other materials imo.  Also, since it breaths so well, it does not offer much sun or insect protection.  Nevertheless, this shirt is perfect for hot weather trips.

As a word of warning, in terms of sizing, these shirts run a bit smaller than the sizing chart would indicate.  I have a 40"" chest and should technically wear a medium, according to the chart.  Medium fits like a muscle tee.  If you are borderline between sizes, you might want to consider going up a size.",B0003216GM
"It snags easily, and the dryer can be death.  Hang dry and don't wear near pointy things.  Other than that it is cool, dry, and a dream for traveling.  Wash in the sink, hang dry overnight (or put on, which makes it dry really fast) and go.",B0003216GM
All ExOfficio clothes are fantastic. Can wash these and the underwear in the sink or shower and they are dry in the morning.,B0003216GM
"Does what it's supposed to - washes easily, dries quickly. However, shorts and a tee shirt will dampen the bath towel which you use to do the initial drying until its beyond use until it dries, which takes a lot longer than the underwear. Don't use your only towel!",B0003216GM
"I work in an unairconditioned warehouse doing manual labor and need a tee that can cope with a day of high heat, humidity, and a lot of movement.  This give'n'go is nearly perfect!

My favorite way to wear the give'n'go is under a cotton tee which allows the cotton to evaporate the sweat and keep me cool, but it keeps the cotton from sticking to my skin and prevents a heat rash in critical places (like the armpits). Perfect combination!

Because of the cost, I only have a couple that I hand wash in the sink after work to wear again the next day.

The sleeves are about 2 inches too long to be worn under the typical tee, but I fold them over and it seems to work just fine.  Fortunately the length is perfect for the typical tee and doesn't stick out the bottom.  The neck could be a little tighter but again it fits under a tee just fine.

I recommend getting your normal size, it is a close fit but that keeps the sweat off your skin.  They also fitted these with very large sleeves for some reason.  I have pretty large arms (I can't roll the sleeves up on button-down shirts) and the sleeves were STILL way too big!

1 star off for the odd cut of the sleeves.

Background:
I've tried every variety of athletic moisture wicking shirt and found that all of them make you very hot until you start sweating.  That's fine if you're only in a game for an hour, but it's a huge dehydration risk after several hours in the heat.

Nylon doesn't block body heat like polyester, so this shirt keeps you cool when you're not sweating (like cotton does) but keeps you dry when you ARE (very UNLIKE cotton.) It still gets wet with sweat, it just doesn't stick to your skin when it's wet.

Woven shirts don't stick to the skin either, but they don't do anything to protect the working man's armpits from heat rashes because of the way they're fitted.",B0003216GM
"I love this company's products, but the collar on this shirt frayed immediately.  I don't know if it's because of contact with razor stubble or a beaded necklace, but it didn't hold up at all and immediately began fraying.  That was a surprise given how wonderful their other products have been.  Wouldn't purchase again.",B0003216GM
"comfortable, looks good, easy to care for --I wish I had 10 more !",B0003216GM
After washing it a few times I noticed the collar is messed up,B0003216GM
IT SNAGS ON EVERYTHING.  HATE IT!,B0003216GM
"Good for travel, easy care..... Expensive in my opinion though.",B0003216GM
Very comfortable with all the other benefits that you read about in their description. I am a fan of this underwear tried a few others and this Brand  ExOffico is the best I've found!,B0003216GM
Not as nice as they used to be. Thinner construct and a bit smaller than my old ones,B0003216GM
This is not what I expected - it is too small and no where is the ExOfficio logo.  I have bought their products before and have always been satisfied.  This is a big disappointment.,B0003216GM
Not an exofficio shirt.  What a turd.  It doesn't even have a brand name anywhere on it.  Do not buy.,B0003216GM
"keeps cool and dry, easy wash, quick dry - great product, great company.",B0003216GM
I love the hat it's just a little tight.,B0003YE1G2
This is a  pretty  cool  shirt  lets  peole  know what  your  into . hardcore weightlifting !,B0005IB51U
