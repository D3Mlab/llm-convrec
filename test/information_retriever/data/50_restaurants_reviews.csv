"So the wife and I decided we needed to go out and grab food. However we did not want our usual choices, so we opted finally check out Brewsters.

I wasn't sure what to expect and upon arrival, it almost seemed like a ""fancy dining"" type place. Yet when we moved closer inside we noticed it was casual yet elegant, if that even makes sense? To the right is a lounge/bar style and to the left was dinner seating. 

We were almost immediately greeted by a server and placed in a booth. We were made aware of the specials and not rushed with our orders. 

When we were ready to order my wife got the fish and chips while I got the aussie lamb burger. We also opted to go with the beer special of the day and picked up a scooner of Bigfoot Blueberry Wheat Ale.

The ale was amazingly delicious. I am immensely impressed with Brewsters attention to detail and quality in regards to their beers. So many restaurants/bars do not clean the lines and if they do they rarely clean them. This means the alcohol is not contaminated and gives a hood clean crisp taste. It also was a nice touch that they put actual blueberries into the beer.

When the food arrived we noticed the portions were large and equaled the price we paid. In fact my wife couldn't even finish her fries. I on the otherhand devoured my burger in record time. It tased amazing and the mint mayo really aided in the flavor. The only negative about my burger was that it had far too much lettuce on it. It was overflowing and spilling out all sides of the burger, almost an inch. I had to eat too much leafy greens before I got to the actual burger.

The server was very nice and polite and attentive to our needs.

This is definitely a 4-5 star place to eat. Loved it and will be back to try some more food and drink some more beer... Thinking the Czech Vampire Pilsner next time.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"So I got roped into conducting interviews on my day off, and we ended up with a 2 hour break between applicants.  Since all three of us were starving, we decided to head off to Brewsters for lunch.

Also, we wanted to see what the management team finds so appealing about two hour lunches.  With beer.

Alas, as we were technically on duty, we skipped the beer.  Yes, I declined a beer.  No, the world is not ending.

Anyhow, we were seated immediately, and the waitress with the really nice, um......eyes was prompt and attentive.  Food arrived quickly, and was pretty damned tasty.

I'd love to give this joint 4 stars, for the waitress with the lovely, um......eyes, if nothing else, but I was a little disappointed with my meal.  The soup was fantastic, but the lobster mac and cheese was unimpressive.  It tasted great, don't get me wrong, but I've had lobster mac and cheese before, hell, I've MADE lobster mac and cheese before, and in my opinion, lobster mac and cheese needs to have lobster in it.

Big, succulent chunks of lobster, not the tiny, nearly unnoticeable shreds that were in this dish.  False advertising.  Damn shame.

Still, it really was quite tasty.  And my friends' burgers looked amazing, not to mention huge.  I would more than likely be back to try one of those.

And also the beer.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I have to say they either train their staff to know the meaning of good customer service or they just hire really good people. Either way, I was impressed with the service. Our server (can't remember her name) was very personable and looked after us very well. She was always checking on our table. And if it wasn't her there were 2 other girls helping her. I think one of them said she was training, but even that new girl was awesome. So, at this point, because I was so mesmerized by the service, I didn't care too much how the food tasted, although it was good too. We ordered the leprechaun for dessert. OMG, we were all in heaven. Why couldn't all restaurants have great service like this one?!",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Hubby and I have been going to this location for years, more often than anywhere else.  It is not our favourite place, just the only decent one in our neighbourhood.  We love a booth in the lounge!  Servers are mostly good to great, remembering our beverage choices and how we like to customize our food.  Never a complaint, no matter how many special requests we have.  Food is usually good but their kitchen staff runs hot and cold -- over the years we have had a lot of food comp-ed because of overcooking.  If you drink beer, you will love the multitude of choices on tap.  They are happy to give a few free sample shot ""testers"" and even sell a beer sampler of their current brews.  Not a lot of choices for vegetarian and seafood entrees.  The veggie burger patty they use is not pleasant.  Great burgers, nachos and salads.  And wing Tuesdays -- there is usually a line-up out the door.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I met a friend for a later lunch on a Friday and the restaurant was busier than I thought it would be at 1PM.  The restaurant on the left side when you walk in has booths and tables and chairs in the middle.  There are several tvs so you won't miss the latest game.  

The menu has appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, entrees, and salads.  My friend was watching his diet to restrict certain foods and the waitresses was helpful to ask the kitchen about options and then came back.  It worked that there was something he could eat and enjoy too.  I asked the difference between the appetizer size and the entr√©e size of fish tacos and was told the appetizer didn't come with a side which worked for me.  The 2 tacos had large pieces of avocado and sauce with some zing but not too spicy.  I was happy with my choice.

The experience doesn't deserve a 4 star rating as I found there were some aspects of the visit that could have been improved.  If I'm in the area, will be back again.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Great drink specials, and huge selection. Food is good but a little expensive in my opinion. Service was pretty good as well.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I do feel this place deserves a five star. The service was superb, so where the caesers--on special on Sundays--and my swiss avocado burger hit the spot. I switched to beer because the caesers went down too easy. The wheat ale pairs well with clamato.

We had the Leprechaun Pie. Mint and white chocolate, yes please!

We enjoyed lunch and the servers were quick and pleasant. There's nothing to conplain about.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I prefer this Brewsters location as it is closer to my house. My friends and I would convene here during the summers for their Tuesday 20 cent wings. Flavors include: hot, honey garlic, salt & pepper, sweet chili or Bow Valley BBQ. They also have a good selection of beer, especially considering they are a brewing company. I would highly recommend trying on of Brewster's brews- at last count they have 14 different flavors.

Brewsters features good menu items for parties of 2 or more to share. The food items are not too far out from what you would find at a Boston Pizza. Even the tvs playing sporting events are laid out in a similar fashion to BPs. I've had good experiences with the pizza, especially their bbq chicken caesar pizza. My friends and I usually come here for the wings though, and it's usually hit or miss. Sometimes the wings are nice and thick, and sometimes they look like they've been malnourished. This inconsistency makes it hard to justify some of the long wait times one can incur at this location.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Decent. 
That's the best word for this space. 
It's not horrible, and it's not great. 

I'd go to brewsters if somebody suggested it , but I would never suggest it myself.

It's not the best price, or the best food , or the best service. But it's NOT AWFUL.
Brewsters is for Moxies Fans. Solidly mediocre.


So if every other gastro pub in the area is full, I guess you could go to Brewsters.  Otherwise, skip it.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I see Brewsters as an upper class sports lounge.

The reason I say that is because they have a lounge/pub feel but still serve higher end/quality food.

I like Brewsters for that reason.

The food here is delicious.  I don't even know what to recommend because I haven't had anything here that I didn't like.

The servers are great.  They, for the most part, seem to enjoy their jobs which is always a refreshing change of pace.

They have so many kind s of beer here that I can't count them.  Well, I probably could but I didn't feel like it.  Sorry.  My point is, if you like beer check out Brewsters.

It's a cool place to hang out and chill while still getting good service, good drinks, and good food.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Been going to this location for years. I go for wing night every now and then. Its pretty typical for prices and food as far as restaurants go. 

The servers are usually pretty solid, I don't recall any issues. They let me taste test different beers! 

 Years ago they had domestic and imports as well as their own crafted beers. Unfortunately,  now they just have their own crafted brews. I enjoy them but I miss my Keiths!

Tis a great place to go. Especially in the summer, if you can get a patio seat! Summer breeze, good beer and good company!",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Even though I didn't order anything here but a diet coke, stole some of my friends orders :P Had the dumpling (ahhh ...nothing to highlight here), Brewsters' coffee ...delish! Wings...not good at all...and the sunrise cocktail was OK but unexceptional  Good for a big group of friends!",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
A nice dinner spot with decent beer.  Reminiscent of Earls or other somewhat family friendly upscalish restaurants.,0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Definitely that spot that you wanna go to if you wanna blow monies on winggsss~

This particular location is within close proximity to a Second Cup... but maybe it's just me that craves coffee all the time hehe.

Usually after a certain time (I think 9pm?) the wings are 25 cents each. However their sizes are quite small so I can see why it would prompt you to buy a whole bunch.

Pros:
- Very sportsy interior with booths, tables, a bar, and high tables. 
- Their menu consists of typical bar foods and drinks.
- Very lively, great for hanging out with pals and getting drinks on a weekend or such.
- They serve beer, but also wine and alcohol!
- They have unique flavors for chicken wings ~

Cons:
- They try to accommodate for large groups, but they make it a hassle so it's probably better for smaller groups.
- Prices are still quite expensive despite nice deals.
- Food is average at best, nothing to rave about.

Definitely liked their sangria. Wish their wings were bigger because honestly who are those lil baby wings gonna feed anyways?!",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Went to this Brewster's a couple of weeks ago to meet a friend who lives in the West End. We were in the restaurant side rather than the lounge side for some reason. The lounge was bumpin' but there were only a couple of other occupied tables on our side. 

Our waitress, Brittany I believe, was really friendly and attentive, checking up on us all the time and chatting with us. She was really great. We ordered nachos to share between three of us and we still couldn't finish them - they were massive. The beer was good, as usual. I'm biased, I love Brewsters and had a good experience at this one. I wouldn't expect anything less.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I've been here a few times and every time I order one of the speciality beers, their out.
I always end up getting the original lager, its still pretty good. I ordered one of the other speciality beers and it was really bitter, unfortunately I don't remember the name.  But what I do remember very well was the fantastic CHEESE BALLS.. They are great, melted brie in a mild crunchy batter, with small tasty notes of Jalapeno.  I would give 5 stars alone just for these. But unfortunately are server was not overly friendly and didn't look like she really enjoyed her job much and it showed...So were down to the 3 star, because of the service and being out of beer stock on some of the speciality beers, (especially on a weekend)",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Brewsters isn't one of my first choices compared to the other restaurant/lounge franchises (Original Joe's, Joey's, Moxie's etc), but for craving for wings on a Tuesday it's not a bad option.  Judging from the lineup and wait, I wasn't the only one to think that.

Our table ordered about 50 wings, five different flavors at 45 cents each (9 - close they are 25 cents I believe).  Won't lie, the wings won't impress you, being a bit small, so if just going to eat these, probably best to order 30-40.  Myself I also ordered the fish taco with side of fries ($14.99).  Was very disappointed in the 2 small tacos.  Does not compare to the nice sized ones at Original Joe's (and you get 3) and taste wise too, these were very bland.  Others ordered the nachos to share, wasn't the best nachos with not much cheese (how I judge a good nacho), they did let us put all the toppings to the side as there were some picky eaters.  On the flip side my nephew loved his kids meal of Mac and cheese.  As well, I'm never disappointed in the raspberry ale ($5.50 on Tuesdays) and the others enjoyed the 5 sampler beers (can choose any of the beers).

But huge shout out to our servers.  Awesome service even while being slammed.  So the stars more so reflected them for making it an enjoyable visit.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here to eat.  But if crave the raspberry beer on a hot summer day on a patio, not a bad option.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
Great steak sandwiches on special Mondays,0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Normally, I am not a fan of chain restaurants but I give props to this Brewester's on the west end for trying. First time I've been to the west end location even though it is super close to me. Anyways, we came here on a Saturday afternoon after a chill session at the driving range. What better way to enjoy the sunshine than on the patio? My thought exactly.

Anyways, the waitresses are friendly enough but it was weird. We had one waitress originally and then 4-5 waitresses came to our tables throughout our meal (with our original waitress disappearing, didn't see her until we left. Odd - she didn't even bring us our bill at the end). 

For the food, I was surprised by some of their options on the menu. Butter chicken, Vietnamese subs, pad thai??? Very random for bar food. Someone tell me if the know how to cook these dishes...

We were hungry so we ordered:

- Chicken wings appetizer ($12) - honey mustard wings (a dozen) along with a few carrot sticks and a beer mustard. My two friends devoured it. Typical wings I believe.
- Chicken strips ($16) - chicken fingers (think you get four or five pieces) over a bed of fries (or your choice of salad/soup). Came with a weird oregano bbq sauce (odd combination) and beer mustard (better).
- Buffalo chicken wrap ($16) - chicken wrap with hot sauce, peppercorn ranch, shredded cheese, carrot, arugula, and tomato. My friend wasn't a fan of the hot sauce (they put a bit too much in it). Also came with side of fries.
- Guacamole bison ($15) - blackened Alberta bison patty with guacamole, melted jalape√±o havarti, tomato and a dill pickle on top. They cook it with a little pink in the middle so it's nice and tender. I was impressed. Pretty good burger! Came with side order of fries.
- Raspberry beer ($20 for a pitcher) - pretty good. Like how they put fresh raspberries in the pitcher!

Overall, decent spot in the west end if you want to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine. You already know what your getting into if your coming here.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I had been to this restaurant on previous occasions and found it to be a good place to relax have a bite and a beverage. In early January I was there with friends and one person in our group became violently ill after eating there. The restaurant management responded with indifference. 

I gave it one star only because you can't post with no stars. I will never eat there again.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
This place is a joke. Came in with a party of seven and two free tables and would not let us use them. Not even allowed to pull them together. My first visit and my last. At least I walked out and never spent my money or time here.,0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"We came. We went for happy hour wings. Many flavors that all seemed to have a hint of seasoning salt flavor. Small wings that were cooked perfectly, but as I mentioned had large hints of seasoning salt flavor (the dry Mexican chili and the piri piri had lots of seasoning salt in their mix). 

Bathroom had problems. One stall door would not open and the other toilet rocked, was not bolted and shimmed down. Yes a bathroom adventure. 

The waitress was wonderful. 

Beer selection good. 

Lots of TVs. So that is good for sports viewing.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Located in an older part of town in the Meadowlark Shopping Centre (a not so great area) but it wasn't chosen by me. The atmosphere was nice and I liked their patio set up.  Friendly waitress and excellent service.

I have always wanted to try this place out since I have one relatively close to me in Oliver Square (104 Ave).  I ordered one of their summer specials, a blackened steak sandwich (?) and an onion soup instead of fries.  I found it to be pretty tasty.  I would go back to try some other items on the menu but probably next time will be the Oliver location.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"A late night visit with an old friend on my last night there, brought us to Brewsters for a sampling of some different beers and a few good laughs.

A very modern style restaurant greets you with plenty of noise, seating and very little light. (and yes, I feel like an old man saying that as a complaint)

We had a very sweet waitress who had great knowledge of the various beers we sampled. Some were not what I was looking for, but most were very delicious. I would love to go back and have a bite to eat sometime soon.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Decided to eat here for lunch because of the patio and for our kids. We ordered chicken fingers and a cheese pizza for the kids and my husband and I shared the short ribs poutine and Saigon Sub. The kids meal was to be expected, standard kids menu meals. The poutine was tasty but very greasy and the sandwich was meh! Overall Brewster is seriously over price especially with two kids meal, a appetizer, sandwich and beverage. The bill was 52 plus a tip, lunch cost $60. My recommendation try somewhere else for lunch in Edmonton, from one foodie to another.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"16 bucks for that? A creative but small summer salad will leave you feeling a bit hungry and unsatisfied. The staff wasn't all that friendly iether unfortunately. There summer salad contains spinach, grape tomatoes, goat cheese, dried cranberries and a few slivers of avocado. The menu also states apple are in it but mine didn't have any...The dressing didn't pair with the salad but it wasn't bad.  Nice venue, big windows and dark wood throughout.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Service - good , food - above average , 1 star??? Some self entered arrogant princess with a dog in her purse was seated because her purse rat was a ""service animal"". I'm wondering is its service licking peanut butter? I don't eat with animals FTS.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"We have a 2 year old son so it was nice to find a ""pub"" style restaurant that accepts kids.
The beer is great loads to choose from, food wasn't too bad.The Lamb burger was great and so were the fish tacos but the Bison burger was dry.

All in all it was a nice spot with a ""pub"" feel, would go again for sure",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
Came here to watch a football game. They were very good at changing the Chanel to the game we wanted.  Brunch goes to 2 on Saturday so Barry and i both ordered steak and eggs.    Food and beers were excellent.  6 Oz steak 2 eggs. Toast and hash browns.   All the important elements were good.   And a great selection of beers,0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
Always great service but tonight they are killing it. An extra busy Friday evening and they are non stop. They multitask and help each other out. Would highly recommend the pub side. And the blueberry beer is amazing.,0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"They have specials on 7 days a week which unfortunately means, you have good reason to go to Brewster's 7 days a week.

First, the star of the show here is the beer. It doesn't matter if you like a smooth lager or a dark stout there is a beer for you. The Hammerhead Red, Shaughnessy Stout, and Flying Frog Lager are standouts but the Hefeweizen isn't as good as it could be. Ask about the seasonal beer, you won't regret it most of the time.

Brewster's isn't a place for pub food. Sure, it  has all the staples like Nachos (which are good and enormous), Burgers, and Fish and Chips. Your burgers are not ordinary burgers, I had the Berliner and it was a bratwurst dream with sauerkraut and bacon. I don't think I have found anything on the menu, that I haven't liked. I just wish the Lobster Mac and Cheese was bigger.

A quick note about the decor, Brewster's underwent a major renovation inside a few months ago and moved it away from a bar look and feel to a restaurant one. It took me a while to get used to the dark wood everywhere, but I barely notice it now.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Great beer, great food, great service! Big thanks to my server Heidi for making me feel comfortable drinking and dining solo!",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"I'm nearly always satisfied with my visits to Brewsters.  They, as you might expect, brew their own beer and at least 80% of the beers are great.  I like their blueberry ale the most.  Their patio is pretty, although located on the street-side of the building and so can be both loud and hot.  The lounge and the restaurant are essentially the same room separated by the bar -- thus, the room can be quite loud.  Their Thai noodle dish is made with atypical noodles, but it still tastes good.  Their War Wonton soup is HUGE and very good.  Their servers always look like they're in pain -- why do employers insist on tight clothing and uncomfortable shoes?  

I go b/c it's in my neighbourhood, and the food is of reliable quality.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"This place is reliably good. Good food, good beer, interesting menu, good service, good air-con, good bar, decent patio,  decent prices. 
Not 'just' good. Reliably good!
In fact this is our default place - on short notice or when indecision rules.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"The wife and I sometimes head here for a fun dinner, and we've yet to be really disappointed. Good food. Not super-fantastic, but really darn good. I've yet to have anything I didn't like. Beer is the same. Darn good. I'm not going to say it's the absolute best ever or anything, but it's certainly several notches above the dishwater that passes for beer in many national brands. I definitely have a pint of something each time I'm there. Service has been consistently pretty good, too. 

The only thing that makes me scratch my head is that there's no host/hostess at the front. I was so incredibly confused the first time I went there, but apparently you just seat yourself. A prominent sign saying so would be quite helpful.

So, yeah, good place, and I'll definitely be back in the future.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Service is great.

The food however... its a complete hit or miss. Don't order the fish and chips you get a half pound of fish and a pound of batter!!
 like learn how to batter fish. It is pretty simple. Thanks for reading my rant be cautious of what you order....",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"Brewsters is a restaurant and brewing company.  It is known for its selection of handcrafted beers, freshly brewed at the downtown location.  There are at least a dozen different kinds of beer.  For those wanting the tried and true, other brands are featured on tap and in bottles.  

The food is classy albeit a bit pricey.  Burgers, seafood, chicken, pizzas, appetizers that are suitable for sharing -- portions are generous and there are a few items not commonly found in these sorts of places, such as butter chicken.  I tend to go for more standard fare like the chicken strips - five plumo, juicy chicken tenders with fries and a homemade beer and mustard dipping sauce.

There are two parts to Brewsters -- the dining room and the pub.  Both parts offer table service, although I prefer the pub with its large screen televisions and pool table.",0CLCzdedGT2DPjkYM52Tqg
"My family and I frequently come here for dim sum and family dinners. I find this restaurant to be one of the better Chinese places. Prices are pretty reasonable and the food is consistent in quality. Our family staple consists of the chicken feet, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice rolls, egg tarts, sticky rice and taro dumplings. I have recommended this place to a few friends and they seem to like it for their first dim sum experience. They have a picture menu for those who are not familiar with menu items.

I find that the staff usually greets us by names and know where we like to sit. They are also very accommodating with kids and have high chairs and booster seats if needed. The restaurant is quite back on the weekends for dim sum so try to get there before 11 am or there might be a bit of a wait. Parking can be hard as they are in the same lot as Chapters and Petsmart.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"I haven't really heard anything amazing about this restaurant from anyone. I was with my sister and I didn't eat all day. It was 3:00pm. We were already in the parking lot and I was hungry. 
Inside the restaurant, it was a very clean and modernized look. The photos of the food looked fabulous in the menu and they did a good job having pictures of each dim sum item on a seperate menu.
It was weird, because we spent half an hour trying to figure out what to order. Also it was the late afternoon and we didn't know if we want to have dim sum or dinner? We both kinda wanted some noodles, but was struggling to find a good noodle dish... They also didn't have a huge selection on noodles either. Subconsciously we thought the food was overpriced compared to a lot of other Chinese restaurants that serve the same kind of food. We were trying to find a dish that was worth our money. 
There were a wide range of servers that work here. Some really know the menu and was able to tell us quickly about each dish and then there were others that had no idea what some of these dishes were. There's English names for all the dishes, but you still need to clarify what food is in it. 
Finally my sister decided on this one noodle dish and they told her they no longer make this dish?! ""Um why is it still on the menu?!"" 
Eventually I ordered a wonton noodle soup and my sister ordered a vegetarian dish.
We looked around and saw that they use BIG dishes, but wow was the serving small. My soup was gross and I was still hungry. I think I drank a bowl of MSG. Had to wash it all down with my tea. The tea was authentic. I tried my sister's vegetarian dish and it taste better.
Overall I didn't feel a consistancy with this place. Hopefully none of my Asian family/friends want to go here for a holiday meal. NO offense, but this restaurant would be a great place for non-Chinese customers.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"We didn't expect this one to be like a formal chinese restaurant. Ambiance is really good a little bit formal than the usual family chinese resto. Dimsum, is really good!! I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews about the dimsum. Probably people who doesn't know how to order. For me, this one is by far the best one i've tasted here in Edmonton South. The only thing that didn't pass on my tastedbuds is the ginger beef. It was too sweet because of the sauce. For a lunch dimsum, we only paid 45 dollars for me and my husband which i think it's not bad. We had 4 dimsum, 1 ginger beef and a cup of rice. I will definitely recommend this place for a great dimsum with my friends and family and i would definitely go back to try their BBQ buns and egg buns, i heard it's tasty!!",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"the wife and i have been to this restaurant about half a dozen times now and every time the food was very good., the best chinese restaurant in edmonton in our opinion. the service is incredibly fast and the portions are generous.food is not too salty as some chinese dishes can sometimes be. will be back again and again. very highly recommended.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"The son runs this one, part of the family that owned the original Tan Tan on Jasper Ave between 97 - 96 st back in the 70/80's. Mom and Dad retired from there, the son then opened Noodle Noodle over by The Brick downtown. He finally settled on Tasty Noodle on Calgary Tr and his sister has a small little restaurant in the westend on 170st and 108 Ave in a strip mall. 

I have been faithfully eating at their places for years. Still great food from the full menu to being one of the best in town for dim sum guaranteed. I have NEVER had a bad meal here and will continue being a faithful customer of theirs for years to come now at 35 years",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"We were so disappointed that this restaurant has changed the way it runs. Initially it was like a traditional dim sum where food is displayed on carts and you select what you like. Now this is like chinese takeout at a mall. You select from a menu with no prices, the food is average and the service poor. Disappointong and very expensive for mall fast food.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
Quick service. Food was average. Very salty. Would eat here again if I was in town and looking for something that isn't a steak or burger.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"The food is above average but the prices are INSANE.

$10.50 for two bowls of jello is robbery.  Don't go, it's not worth the prices here.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Ordered delivery a few times from here . Checked the restaurant out  a week ago . Excellent food . I tried a lot of different dishes . No complaints at all . Full of flavor and well portions . The restaurant had all day order dim sum that I did not try but it looked great ! Salt pepper squid , ginger beer were supper tasty . Will be going back here again",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Don't go to this restaurant unless you want to be rip off. So first off, we went inside the restaurant and waiting to be seated. Instead of giving me and my friend the table, waitress will give whoever she sees first the table. Finally when we seated, we saw a dim sum menu with no price tag, guess the restaurant don't want us to know. When we finally made the order, dishes were coming super slow, and the waitress were throwing the dishes on our table, uhhhhh........ at the end, when we start to pack our left overs, some waitress who were pushing the dessert cart asking us if we want dessert. We thought this is like other Chinese restaurant l, get free dessert at the end, so we take 2 puddings. But unfortunately, these desserts are not free and they are extremely over- prices. When I express my concern at the cashier, she says she doesn't care how I feel and she doesn't care if I come back to this restaurant or not. Worst dining experience in Edmonton.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Tasty Noodle is the new and updated location of Noodle Noodle restaurant, which used to be downtown in McCauley/Chinatown area. For years this was my family's choice destination for Dim Sum in Edmonton. I can understand why they would feel the need to move their location, as I am sure many people would be deterred from venturing into that part of the city for lunch or dinner. It's a shame though, as it would be nice to see a revitalization of Edmonton's Chinatown rather than businesses being forced to move out in order to be sustainable. 
Anyways, it's new location is really easy to access and has plenty of free parking (this was lacking in downtown). The Dim Sum is just as good as I remember, and the service is....well, the servers aren't there to chat. They take your order and bring you your food. If nothing it's at least efficient! I have also ordered off the menu and didn't like it as much as when I have gone for the Dim Sum, though the War Won Ton really hits the spot on a cold, dreary winter day. 
I think generally people find ""their"" Chinese food place and tend to stick to it. Tasty Noodle has been mine and it will continue to be as long as it keeps serving up great quality Dim Sum.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"This dim sum serving resteraunt was really good, my family and I enjoyed a wide variety of items and took alot home...service was excellent.!!.. overall I will be back",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Great alternative to GRB or Beijing Beijing. We come here for dim sum at least once a month.  The service is great and the dim sum is delicious.  The pricing may be more than dim sum restaurants in Chinatown, BUT it's Chinatown, if you catch my drift.  Haven't tried this place for dinner though.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
Came here the other day for their all day dim sum. Staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. The food was really good and the portion sizes were pretty decent. My only slight issue with this place is that their dim sum menu does not show prices beside each item. So this can lead to a bit of sticker shock when your bill is brought to the table. I did find this place a little bit pricey as well. But over all the food was good and we left quite satisfied.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw

"Used to come here for Sunday family gatherings and stopped because of the service and food. We tried it again this week for dinner. We were seated right away and the server left a menu with pictures and dim sum list. We have to ask for the menu with the price (recommended) as each varies from $5-$6., and main courses between $20-32. The server did not take time to explain and hurriedly took our orders. It came in very fast - the servings were moderate. For 6 dim sums and two main courses - our bill was $85 for 3 persons.  This place is a go-to once in a while for dim sum - And if you are not bothered seeing servers noisily gathering plates and talking loudly (almost shouting) with each other - then enjoy!",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Get ready to get extra-F**ked if you order from SkipTheDishes.  Menu items are almost DOUBLE the price.  A single egg roll?  $6.50.  5 extremely mediocre spring rolls?  $18.95.  F**k Off.  Mixed Chinese greens vegetables?  $21.95.  This is such a gigantic ripoff it's not even funny.  If the assholes who own this place realize that delivery orders are not occupying seats in their restaurant, they might understand that paying Skip $30% discount is worth pushing the extra food out of their kitchen.  Instead, they charge you DOUBLE.  Don't get screwed by those place.  Will never, ever order from this dumpster fire of a ""restaurant"" again.  Worst scammers in the city,",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"My favorite Dimsum in the city. 

Dimsum which is available not just at brunch, items can be ordered with dinner as well. 
Always crazy busy on Saturday and Sunday.

Fantastic classic chinese dinner menu as well. Great for long chinese dinners and special events. 

Got a headache? Wouldn't advise going. This is a chinese restaurant + Dimsum. 
Quiet and Dimsum do not go together.

I give this 5 screaming babies out of 5.

Tip: Sunday Dimsum - Try and avoid the church crowd. Either go early or later.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
Ordered delivery through Skip the Dishes and was not disappointed. I was craving dim sum and ordered a good assortment. Everything was well packed including a variety of sauces. The flavour was fresh and nothing was great. Was just as good as eating in the restaurant. Would highly recommend.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"The dim sum here is rather delicious. And while I've only ever ordered dim sum here, I do totally recommend it for that. So many wonderful dishes! It's hard not to over order when out for dim sum in general, but this place is good. The menu is varied but really quite good.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"I'm very sad to downgrade my review of Tasty Noodle.  And so drastically.  But I won't be going back for Dim Sum.

I'll leave it as 2 stars because the food is still decent.  But the overall experience is just not right.

There was no lineup and a few tables were empty on Sunday at 12:30.  That should have been my first clue that something was wrong.  When we sat down, we were given a big ""menu"" with a bunch of pictures on it, and a sheet of paper that we were apparently supposed to indicate our order on.  We weren't told anything.  These items were just placed in front of us.  We had to flag somebody down to explain it.

So... there's no more carts.  With the exception of the dessert cart.  You have to order your dishes.  I don't like this for a few reasons.  #1 - I prefer to leave dim sum up to fate.  What I eat, depends entirely on what carts come around that day.  #2 - All of your food comes out at once now, and you need to find room for it on your small table.  #3 - the menu does not list any prices.  With the old method, I could keep track of what I was spending, but this way I cannot.

It's really not an enjoyable experience for me and not worth the drive from St. Albert anymore.  I'll stick with Jumbo on the West End now.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"A friend and I tried Tasty Noodle for the first time on a Saturday at about 8 pm. Tasty noodle had been recommended by a good friend of ours. We decided to give Tasty Noodle a try as they offer all day dim sum.

Upon arrival, the restaurant was quite packed but we were quickly seated. The restaurant is modern and very clean. Service was quite pleasant and our orders were taken right away. We only stuck to the dim sum menu. Food came quick but the dim sum was nothing special. When the bill came, my friend and I were a bit surprised at how pricey it was. 

Overall, Tasty Noodle had good service but the price was high and dim sum was average. I would come back as they offer all day dim sum and my experience wasn't too bad. I was quite impressed with service and the amount of time that the food arrived at our table, despite the restaurant being completely full.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Always a great choice for dim sum on the south side of Edmonton.  Half the tables are gone for social distancing.   Curry squid, baked bbq pork buns, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings w chives, and noodle-wrapped shrimp were all fast, hot and delicious.   Kim chi with ginger was also unique and tasty.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"This review is based on the dim sum only.  OK, I really wanted to like this place because it's the closest dim sum to me and their egg yolk buns are good. Yes, they don't have the roll-around carts that are more traditional, but I actually don't mind just ordering off a menu as it means I can get exactly what I want faster.  So I gave this place 2 visits to try and convince me, but unfortunately, no.

I judge a dim sum restaurant heavily on the quality of their har gow (shrimp dumplings) and theirs are not good. Although they do visibly have shrimp in them, they taste fishy and stale, as if they also have substantial fish paste filler of some sort. The pork and shrimp dumplings are larger than I expect, but this turns out to be because they're mostly pork, and the shrimp can barely be tasted at all. The eggplant with shrimp was okay though a bit oily. And as mentioned the egg yolk buns (a sweeter dessert option) were good.

The biggest fail was the deep fried calamari rings. Yup, that's what the menu says - deep fried calamari rings. What arrived was a big bowl of deep fried random vegetables, with a few calamari rings perched on top. Seriously, over half the bowl was not calamari. It was mostly just deep fried carrots, peppers, lots of onions... not calamari at all. Sorry, but I've ordered calamari at dim sum restaurants in many, many dim sum restaurants in several different cities and this is the ONLY place that's been so cheap as to fill up the bowl with deep fried vegetable scraps and then have the nerve to charge $10 for it. It wasn't even great calamari, what of it there was - fairly tasteless, needed more salt, could have used garlic or something too, and was a bit too oily. I am so unimpressed by this that I've uploaded a photo showing what the ""calamari"" bowl looked like when I had removed all the calamari.

Sorry, but I'm going to have to find another place for dim sum. Neither the food quality nor the business practices impress me here. Try Beijing, Beijing just up the road instead if you're looking in South Edmonton.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Food is always excellent here.  We especially love their duck.  They were able to accommodate gluten free dishes for my friend one time.  Thank you so much.  We also love the dim sum here.  Always fresh.  Place is so clean all the time too including the washroom, which is a plus with kids.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Just been to the city for three months, I discovered several good eateries, and Tasty Noodle is definitely one of my favourite places for dim sum. Its egg tarts are the best I have ever had! I like the modern look of the restaurant. The staff are very attentive. Be sure to get there early for Sat dim dum as it gets packed fair quickly.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Boycott this place!

My wife and I have been thinking of trying Tasty Noodle for a couple of months. Today, it finally fit in with our commute plans and we started perusing the menu on our way there.

Once we reached ""shark fin dumpling"" on the takeout dim sum menu, we nixed that plan... For good.

No restaurant serving shark fin meat should stay in business, given the inhumane harvesting methods and endangering of the species.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Tasty Noodle delivers tasty dimsum. Great dimsum made to order and therefore hot.  Also you don't have to wait for the cart w your fav dimsum to arrive.  It's almost always after you're full or compromised w less than fav dish.  Sticky rice is really tasty and reminds me of Cantonese style w sausage and generous meat.  Great veg dishes.  The veg roll in tofu wrap tends to fall apart.  It would be better to have a smaller wrap with less filling that is tighter and can be picked up - that being said, it had a good veg variety and all cooked well, not over cooked.  Most tables also order large plates of veg and noodles. We ordered gai lan w garlic.  Crunchy and delicious.  Definitely will retu",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Tasty Noodle is a south side offering of Chinese food, and like most Chinese restaurants serve dim sum during the day and set menus/a la carte dishes at night. I personally think it's hard to review a Chinese restaurant for both as the quality can vary widely between dim sum and dinner. In this instance I'll be talking about the dim sum.

First off, we get seated pretty efficiently for a table for four around 1pm. A server comes by with a dish of sriracha, tea, and the stamp card invoice thing for the dim sum girls to mark up. The dim sum girls walk by with a cart almost immediately - with your typical favorites - har gow, siu mai. Of course we snatch those up like hotcakes (some restaurants you have to wait forever for these!) and get settled into our dim sum groove. 

I test every single establishment that serves dim sum for two things: a) how the wrap is made for the har gow and b) the consistency of the radish cake. The reason for this is these aren't necessarily hard dishes to make, but hard to perfect, and it gives me an idea of how dedicated the restaurants are in making good food. It also determines whether I will be back for another round. So the verdict: a) the wrap was ok. It was a little too sticky and thick compared to others that I've seen but it didn't make the whole dumpling fall apart. Taste was good. b) the radish cake was too runny. You could definitely see that they used a lot of radish, and it was oozing with flavor, but the consistency ended up in a mush by the time your chopsticks were in there and melted weirdly in your mouth.

Bonus: I'm a sucker for egg tarts so I always get one of these as dessert. The crust was too thick, the custard was good enough. 

I wasn't blown away by Tasty Noodle but it was overall a pleasant dining experience. Would not mind coming again.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"While dropping by down South for Chapters, we decided to give Tasty Noodle a try as it was lunch hour as well as it was just a walk away from the bookstore. Convenient, I'd say! The inner restaurant looked busy as we looked into the window of the restaurant. I thought "" if it's busy, it must be good'. And, so we were sat down in less than a minute - peered through the menu that was quickly handed to us - from then I realised it was not wholly a specialised Noodle shop despite the restaurant's name. Slightly disappointed but what can I say - it was still worth the try whatever they've got to offer. 

Since it's a Chinese restaurant, instantly I thought of one of my favourite Chinese dish which is called ""Ma Po Tofu"" basically small soft cubed tofu stir fry with mince meat, peas, carrots etc. Just so you know it is a spicy dish. I made sure they made it clear to the chef that I wanted it really really really spicy. Yeap! I couldn't emphasize that enough. +(^.^)+ The Chinese lady took my order quite well and made sure that I for one wouldn't regret asking for the ""extra spiciness"". I assured her that I am more than capable of consuming a high level of spicy food at any given time. I am from an Asian descent after all. Well, I'm clearly stereotyping here. Don't mind me. :p

My partner on the other hand loves his dim sum as much as I do. So he ordered the regular dishes that we both usually have at dim sum restaurants. The list consists of pork pastry, bbq pork rice roll, curry squid, chicken skewer with sweet sauce. Everything was great except for two items: the curry squid (dry and awfully chewy) and the chicken skewer (the sauce had an odd flavour to it). It was slightly disappointing as both of those items were our favourites. Regardless some setbacks on a couple of items, the service was very helpful with the lady who initially took my order. She was pleasant, friendly and a very helpful server compared to most of the unfamiliar servers around. 

Overall, it has a good atmosphere, dim sum was lovely and the ma po tofu here is to die for!!! It literally won my heart. I hope they keep that up. Will definitely be coming back again. 

P.S. Near the end of our dining moment, we saw a familiar server from Cha for Tea Palace and enquired if this was under the same management. And so, it is under the same management. By now, they have about 3 restaurants I believe. 
Cha Tea Palace, Tasty Noodle and another one located in a casino. 

Well, time to venture on.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"The service was alright and the food, pretty good. But when I asked to have a few slices of cucumber for my water they told me flat-out that they would not as their cucumber was designated for use in one of their dishes.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Order the three dishes Peking Duck! It comes as ""tacos"", soup, and a lettuce noodle mix. One dish satisfies the craving of four hungry persons. The staff are very friendly. The dish apparently doesn't appear on the menu so you have to ask for it. Several staff asked how come we know about the dish. This is our second time here, first time we were invited by a Chinese family.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
Average price for average food. I have always gotten good customer service that's why I keep coming back :),0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Food is typical dim sum, priced high for Chinese dim sum. Seating arrangement is very sketchy, owner likes to sell to larger group, so first come first serve is not practised, will give away table to larger group regardless of your earlier arrival.  Never go back there again.  There are competitive Chinese establishments nearby with better hospitality practice.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"I would be honest to say I did not expect this place to be a very nice resto because of its name :-) i thought it was just another typical chinese resto --- you know: crowded, fast-paced, mediocre taste of food.

But i was wrong. It was in fact quite a formal restaurant. And oh did I mention the food? I love them. I especially love the sweet and sour fish. Also try their soups, they're delicious! Nomnom...

I will definitely be back again.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"I have nothing bad to say at all, I was very impressed.  

My mom and I went for Dim Sum on Sunday at about 11 am, and although it was almost full, there was no wait at all and the carts starting come by immediately.  There was a good pace to the carts as well, we never had to wait very long for our next option.  The staff were extremely friendly!  Everytime I said ""thank you"", they would respond with ""thank you as well"".  Which delighted me to no end for some reason.

The food was delicious!  I would gladly go every day.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"The food here has always been very tasty. Nothing here is mind-blowing or a must-try, but they have a good selection of tried and true favourites that seem fresh, well-proportioned, neatly presented and taste just like you expect. I've mostly come for dim sum - shrimp dumplings, pan fried dumplings, garlic greens, pork dumplings, shrimp rice roll, chicken feet, sticky rice - all gobbled up by those in my party. They also have great customer service (especially for an Asian restaurant - what can I say?). Decent prices as well. Little more than downtown but I think the rent on a place on Calgary Trail is much higher. A restaurant where I have never been disappointed. :)",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw

Everything about my dining experience was spectacular. The service was fast. The servers were attentive. The food was delicious and came out fast and piping hot.

"I my opinion this is not as good as other dim sum places in Edmonton. I feel some of the reviews are by friends or family. Curry squid was over cooked and hard to eat. Then, sui  mai had so much fat mixed in I returned the dish asking for chicken Sui mai. When the dish arrived it was pink, uncooked and not seasoned. For most expensive dim sum in Edmonton I would expect better quality.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Visited Tasty Noodle recently for a wedding reception. It was definitely above my expectations! The reception took up at least half of the resto, but because of the layout and the service, it felt like we had the place to ourselves. We had ten dishes which were timed well; none of the tables suffered for lack of service or food. The clearing of dishes was timely and the service staff were generally on top of things. Food was good, more traditional Chinese (thank god), I really liked the jellyfish salad, the cured duck with gai lan, the pan fried noodles with enoki mushrooms, and the crab & egg soup. Had a great time, everything was clean and organized, and the reception went off well. I'd definitely come back! Hopefully there's not just a caucasian menu and a secret (chinese) menu. I did get asked like 7 times if I'd like silverware, so maybe... The Chinese menu is good anyhow!",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Paid this new dim sum joint a visit today for a round of early afternoon bites with my mom and dad - we walked away happy campers. Their dim sum menu is short but do offer popular items like egg tarts, beef tendon, chicken feet, rice cripes etc. If you're a fan of hand made to order dishes, this place will probably disappoint as some dishes suggest that they were pre-made. This wouldn't be uncommon for all day dim sum joints. 

Best dish of the day I'd say is their Chouzhou noodle, #4 on the back of the center piece feature. The dish falling short of expectations would be the ginger beef; fried hard like leather layered in sauce. But hey, some people like it so...

Dishes that I'll be sure to try out next time would be the buns!
Aside from that, this restaurant offers the openness and roomy seating in their newly renovated dining room. Feel free to take up on their patio seating with back drop to the flow of traffic of Calgary trail. 
This restaurant is brand spankin' new to the Edmonton clientele but I imagine it would make a great spot for functions given their bar area can definitely tend to a few line ups easily. Looking forward to my next visit!",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
Extremely tasty but pricy compared to other locations. I would have said $$$ for prices. We 9 dishes and it was $84. So not sure if we would go back on price in comparison to food quality.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
We always come here to order PEKING DUCK. Fills four people and plenty of take home. This dish is not on their menu. If you do not place the order in Chinese you may have to repeat the order several time. It appears as if staff don't believe you know of the dish. It is a large three course meal. The first is taco and duck. The second is delicious vegetable and duck soup. The last course is marinated duck mixed with a vegetable mix. We usually order chicken fried rice and tea. The waitresses are very attentive and the place is always busy bustling with large groups and individuals. Clean washrooms.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"This is my choice for Chinese when I visit Edmonton, mainly due to the flavors remind me when I would travel to Shanghai.

"Our family's first choice for dim sum in Edmonton.  The dishes are always hot and enjoy ordering off the menu instead of having to wait around for our favourite dishes to arrive by cart.  Some of our favourite dishes are chinese doughnut in rice roll, shrimps and peaches and my kids love the mango pudding.  Can get busy on weekends but don't usually have to wait long for a table.  Prices are little more than some other places, but the selection and quality of the dishes are worth it.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Saturday night at 6:30 and the restaurant was getting full.  Within an hour, people had to wait until a table was available.  The  restaurant presents itself as a modern and appealing place for a Chinese restaurant, unlike some dark and dingy places.  But appearance doesn't mean the food will be great.  I noticed the customers varied and the dishes ordered varied from the more traditional Chinese dishes to chicken balls and dim sum.  

We ordered set dishes and added a few more.  We had soup, lettuce wrap duck, crab/lobster dish, fried chicken, peaches and shrimp, veggies, sweet sour pork, fish, and noodles.  The size of the dishes was adequate and enough for the table of 11 with some leftovers.  The food was flavourful and not greasy.  

Service throughout the night was good with refills on our drinks and rice.  The bill was a little high compared to other places at around $250 but still decent for the amount of food.

Would recommend reservations if you come with a large group or on the weekend evenings.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Surprisingly my first time here! I always thought this restaurant would be a ""westernized"" Chinese place. But we tried the dim sum today and it was authentic and very good. You order off a menu and can pick from dim sum carts. My favorite items was the sticky rice and Turnip cake. Price wise, slightly more than other places, but quality is pretty good. The place is clean and spacious, and busy when we were there. 
Their dim sum is worth a try if you are looking for a place in the deeper south!",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
My favourite place for dim sum in the city.  Food is always consistent which I appreciate. I really just go for the steamed pork buns because they're soooooooooooo good. I also love the garlic broccolini and ginger beef.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"The quest for better noodles brought me to the southside to try a place called the Tasty Noodle.

Arrived at 1:30ish, the place was still somewhat busy, a good sign.  The place was reasonably clean, it was about 80% full.  A bit on the noisy side but not disturbingly so.  Service was fast, I was motioned towards an empty table.  Both noodle menu and dim sum menu was quickly placed on the table.  Their dim sum menu, complete with multiple colour pictures, looked good but I craved noodles, I want my noodles; especially from a restaurant called the ""Tasty Noodle"".

I ordered the vermicelli with XO sauce and waited patiently.  The noodles arrived within 10 minutes SUPER hot.  No, that plate definitely did not sit under a heat lamp for any amount of time.

The first thing which I noticed was the colour, not the usual deep brownish red XO sauce colour I am accustomed.  The second thing was the smell, I smell... of all things, a hint of ketchup; I also do not detect the typical ""wok hei"" (that slight hint of smokiness from the hot woks) which most traditional fried noodle dishes have.  There was a healthy amount of shrimp cubes and bay scallops on the dish.  I can't really complain about the look, just not what I was expecting.

Taste wise, the dish was okay, yes, just okay.  My taste bud confirmed that there may be tomato paste or ketchup in the dish.  The taste of XO sauce, although present, was very slight; disappointing, if this is the Iron Chef competition, the dish would fail because the theme ingredient was almost undetectable.  The dish reminded me more of an Italian pasta than a Chinese fried noodle dish.  

Despite it being served fresh and hot to me, I had to put the vermicelli with XO sauce in the ""meh"" category.  I wanted XO flavour, I didn't get it.

Service wise, it was fast, then faster, then curt, then outright rude.  I arrived after the lunch hour but I do not consider it late.  Before I even start eating, the ladies were already rearranging tables around me shouting that they will work around me so they don't have to wait.  How uncomfortable is it when you are trying to eat and staffs are rearranging furniture around you.  Half way through my lunch, two ladies were standing beside my table with brooms waiting.  As soon as I wolfed down my last bite of food, the plate was taken away and I was told that my bill is coming.  As soon as my bill came a lady stood there with the credit card machine waiting.  I didn't even have time to sip my tea.  I looked at the clock, it was 2:10pm, it looks like they have every intention of rushing everyone out by 2:15pm.  I was unhappy about the rudeness that I dropped the tip amount from the customary 15% to 10%.

On top of the service issue, I was charged $1.50 for tea.  I know dim sum restaurants do it all the time, noodle restaurants generally don't.  No one asked me whether I wanted tea for a charge when I sat down, it was brought to me.  I had no time to drink it because I was being hurried out.  Not a big deal but not happy about it.  

It was not a comfortable dining experience.  The food was okay, the service missed the mark.  $14.50 plus tax for a plate of noodle for lunch is on the expensive side.  I have a 2.5 star number in mind, I rounded it up to 3 as I am willing to mark this experience as the servers are having a bad day; the Tasty Noodle is definitely not the best noodle restaurant I have been to but not the worst either.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Recently ordered dim sum take out and wow. The portions are large and plump! I was surprised how big the food was as we've ordered from here before and I don't remember the things being that big. 

We ordered the dumplings and some other things. Check out the picture, they are plump juicy, and so flavourful! I was very happy with this order. They still offer a discount for pick up so make sure to support this great dim sum place and order your pick up yourself.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Tried this out today with my Mom and Daughter, food was good and tasty.  It is Dim Sum and it does not disappoint with the traditional Dim Sum service and food including Rice Rolls, Shrimp Dumplings and Green Onion Cakes.

This is the old Noodle Noodle from Downtown moved south, it does not disappoint.

Left satisfied. There was a wait when we were leaving to get in but it is worth the wait. Will definitely try again.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
One of the few places you can get dim sum delivered from during the pandemic. It's good but pricey. But it hits the mark for when you're having a craving. Averages about $25/person for dim sum.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw

"The best dim sum of my life. The service and the food are 5 out of 5. I don't mind ordering dim some instead of cart service as all your food comes out hot and fresh. Besides dim sum favorites, you would be wise to order Hong Kong pork chops, wow, Soup dumplings (only on weekends), pepper chicken with crispy spinach, yum, and ginger beef , just found out ginger beef is a Edmonton invention, I thought it was great. Yes you have to pay for greatness. If I lived closer, I would eat here often. People of Edmonton you don't know how lucky you are!!!!",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Ordered twice through different platforms, both fairly good! Everything tastes brilliant.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"It's a rare weekend indeed when I get a chance to get out with friends for Dim Sum, but one such rare weekend popped up recently, and it was decided to try somewhere new. A friend suggested the Tasty Noodle on Calgary Trail and the consensus was ""sure, what could it hurt?""

Answer: It did not hurt anything but our bellies after they were stuffed full of delicious food.

We arrived with a fairly large group and were handled very easily, the staff was friendly, and the cart service was prompt and excellent. There was an almost overwhelming stream of food constantly passing our table, and the tea was never empty.

The food was very good. Everything we tried was very tasty, and there was a lot of variety. In particular, I'm always on the lookout for a good BBQ pork bun - and Tasty Noodle didn't let me down there. One of the best I've had in Edmonton, and I went back for them a few times.

Language barrier remains a bit of an issue - but that's fairly common during all of my Dim Sum experiences. Fortunately, we also continue to bring our friend along who speaks ""Chinese Menu,"" and that helps immeasurably.

I'd recommend getting there early on the weekend if you want to get in on the Dim Sum - we did and were seated promptly, but by the time we left the place was packed and there was a bit of a lineup to get in.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Skip the dishes order.  Wow, I've never seen or heard of a menu so ridiculously expensive.  The quality is okay, not the worst but definitely not he best but holy mackerel the cost is crazy.  A plate of fried Cantonese noodles is $5 - 8 more than anywhere else.  I'm never gonna order from them ever again.  The menu is ridiculous.  Paid over $70 for 3 dishes.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"I think this place needs two ratings.

As a lunch spot, it can't be beat. The dim sum is ridiculously good and fresh and worthy of a five star rating.

After 2pm? It's overpriced and seemingly reheated in fresh fare I could get for less at the Save on Foods freezer section in the adjacent plaza. 2 stars at most.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"If it was possible, I wish to give zero star. The worst service ever, lady boss doesn't know how to talk to customers. Just average tast, very expensive, shitty service. Never go again",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Just had delivered, bland soggy gingerbeef, overdone vegetables, pasty chow main. Wickedly overpriced. Won't be back.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
CRAZYYY HOW EXPENSIVE THEY ARE FOR SUCH A SMALL PORTION!! I paid $8 for 3 dumplings!! That was crazy. And it tasted very basic like any dimsum place. Nothing special. The server were also very rude. Never going back.,0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"20 bucks for 5 spring rolls INSANE  RIGHT !!!! they are the most expensive Asian place I've EVER dined in ,160 bucks for me my husband and our 13 yr old that's CRAZY TO ME .. hundreds of other better places .. it's a HELL NO from me",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"We frequently go to Tasty Noodle for dim sum. Today we decided to order take out instead. The food has always been good. My only complaint is that they messed up our order, even though the guy who took our order read it back to me. I called just to let them know the guy read me back my order and we received 2 orders of steamed rice instead of 2 orders of Sui Mai. They continued to argue with me that I ordered incorrectly. Bad customer service in my opinion. Will never order take out from there again.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Great spot for convenient pick up! They offer 20% off your order if you go pick it up for takeout! We love coming here for dim sum and usually that's what we order. The shomai and the deep fried shrimp wonton dumpling with mayo are my favourite!! If you're in the mood for low cost but decent dim sum, try this place out! We usually call to order ahead and then pick up.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"Quick review as I only had a quick meal here. The food quality was good and there is definitely a wide selection of items. The restaurant is clean and the service is prompt. 

My only concern really is the price of each item. We only had chicken fried rice and a vegetarian dish between the two of us, yet the dinner came out to $38.00. 

That's a bit too much in my books for pretty basic Chinese dishes.",0IG9w6YCkh-z5pnfSip6Nw
"This place is amazing. Food is great and consistent every single time. 
I've tried few different noodles and I like all of them. They also do noodle refills, which is great if you are hungry!",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"I just wanted bubble tea - the place across from Dagu was closed (not sure why, no reason on the door). 

Went to Dagu to pick up a mango cheese drink. It was worth it. I came back to try another drink.",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"A new fixture on Jasper and 104th. This rice noodle chain makes its way to Edmonton and it doesn't disappoint. You have many options of hot soup and various proteins. And I mean hot, the bowl comes sizzling to your table. I had the sour & spicy flavoured noodle soup with XiangXi pulled beef. It was such a great blend of flavours. The tender beef mixed with the sweetness of the vegetables helped the rice noodles suck up all that flavour. And the noodles were refillable which is a win in my books. I want to experience all that broth! Will definitely be going again.",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"I visited this restaurant after hearing that it offers authentic (Yunan-styled) rice noodles and that you get unlimited refills on the noodles. In terms of the restaurant, I like their setups and the service was really good even though they had a full house on a regular workday. In terms of food, I tried the traditional pork bone soup rice noodles. I am not sure if it was 100% authentic but it was definitely good. You get boiling hot soup with noodles on the side. One suggestion for those that want multiple refills is that you should ask for a refill ASAP (i.e. ask for a 2nd bowl of noodles when the first one comes) so that the soup is still warm when the refills arrive.",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"I love noodles so of course I had to try this place as soon as I found out. 
I liked the over all atmosphere of this place, clean and simple with light colour decors. 
I tried the spicy and sour soup with rice noodles the first time and spicy soup with rice noodles for the second, third, and fourth time. Needless to say, I like this place. The spicy soup reminds a lot of the spicy soup base at hot pot, which is also my favourite. By the way, their noodles is unlimited, you just have to ask for more. 
Their specialty drink is also super yummy, I had a watermelon and cheese drink and it tastes fresh and well balanced. 
I'll probably go back next week.",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"Love the place, reminds me of the motherland. We went on a cold winter day and the spicy noodles warmed us right up! Prices are super reasonable ($11.99 for a bowl with all the sides), and they come with endless noodles! I definitely refilled. 

Another thing that I highly recommend is the cheese cap drinks. The bubble tea is only alright, but the cheese caps are amazing. Recommend.",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"More real China experience than you have any right to expect. 

Big fun for spicy treats (with some serious schezuan peppercorns)  and tea (or beer). Not everything may please the Western palate, but worth the adventure. Recommend the chicken skewers. The sticky rice skewers also seemed to go over well. The bang bang chicken was more eclectic (cold but spicy and bone in pieces) and I'm not sure I'd order that again. 

Friendly service. Big, clean dining room. 

Super fruit tea is a vacation in a cup.",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"This is the latest rice noodle chain to arrive in Edmonton this year. Inside is modern and bright. The service is friendly and knowledgeable. Also who doesn't love unlimited noodle refills?! 

I've been here three times now and food has been great for me each time. To order, you have  to fill out a sheet of paper to pick which items you want. I highly recommend the items on the bottom of the menu with ""crossing the bridge"" in its name. This means that all the items for the soup will be given to you in a tray and you can put the items in yourself. The top portion of the menu has the soups prepared with the items dumped in already. However I feel like it's more fun and I think there's more soup items provided if you choose a crossing the bridge soup option.

My favorite soup so far is the spicy and sour soup with beef. I love the flavor and it's mixed with the perfect spices to make you want to crave for more. Also the bubble tea options here are fantastic. I rank it high in the bubble tea places in the city. The fruits in the bubble tea are fresh and the size of the drink is decent. The price of the buuble tea and the noodle soups are reasonable.

It's definitely a place to check out if you like rice noodles!",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"The atmosphere is quite pleasant. There is unlimited noodles and their bubble tea selection is great. However, I will note that the tomato broth is quite bland. I'm vegetarian and therefore, I wasn't sure if I could add the chili. Other than that, you can get a nice fully belly",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"Love the hot soups! Especially the beef in bone soup! It was boiling hot and had alot of meat on the bones. Also has a taste of the shrimp noodle bowl (currently labelled as the 'Fresh Rice Line'). The broth was definately more rich in flavour due to the added seafood flavour to the base broth. So if you like your broths more flavorful, get that. Although I knew there were unlimited noodles, 1 bowl of noodles left me super full! The Lotus root stuffed rice is sweet, mushy and cold. The taste was ok, but I didn't like the texture. Also tried the cheese strawberry drink. It tasted like a liquid strawberry cheesecake SO GOOD!!!",2Z8LWDUbrUbe-o3KZE2r7Q
"I wish I could live here.  The only thing missing would be a few lighter menu options.  If you can't eat meat, or dairy, you're kind of screwed.  Just order some more wine and you'll be ok.

On market day, however, we checked it out for brunch--surprisingly yummy!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"My husband and I went to Tzin to celebrate Valentine's Day and boy did we get a treat! The ambiance is always wonderful, the space is small but well curated and generates a cozy vibe. The restaurant only seats about 17 people but you can see the kitchen and watch the food being made and the service is always quick, professional and informed. Our server made excellent wine recommendations and was clearly very knowledgable about what would pair well with the food. The food itself was great, it was a set menu but all courses including the steak and fish was well made and very tasty. If you go on a regular night without a set menu o recommend the bacon crostini, it's out of this world good. The menu is usually Tapp as to share but I have yet to have something I didn't like here and always feel well taken care of the staff. Check this place out, it's a great local restaurant.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Had a wonderful meal and the host was very attentive and made wonderful suggestions. We went with the chef's menu and would do so again! It was a busy place, even on a Wednesday night.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Fantastic! Great service, atmosphere & food. We choose the option of having them choose our dishes. The best decision made. We had dishes that were on the menu as well as dishes not listed. We would have all of them again. The plating wss beautiful. The descriptions of each dish was amazing. Can't wait to go there again.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Since coming here the first time, Tzin has gone steadily down in my books. Apparently the lovely lady who helped us last time has since been fired. I am not sure why but i say bad move. The two new staff they have are not to my liking. Nice enough people but they are just like every other kind of waiting staff. I loved the exciting eccentric energy of the first lady. The food is also somehow not the same. The last two times we had the steak pieces they tasted rotten, i could not finish them as i was sure they had gone bad. Also my favourite drink has somehow changed. It was a glass of sparkling wine with a drop off black current syrup siting at the bottom, so the flavour changed as you got down lower. now it comes to me as a pink beverage that tastes nothing like the original. Very disappointed. Will not be back sadly.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This place is an absolute delight! Reservations are a must, and earlier is better because they sometimes run out of certain items. They serve some of the best prepared seafood I have ever had- get anything with seafood and you will not be disappointed. Also, if you can handle it, go for the feed me option and tell them what you like!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Wow! Terrific place. Tried 3 of the tasty tapas style dishes. 3 is just enough to feed 2 people I suppose. A little pricey but filled with great taste!

The owners/bartenders were very friendly to me & my lady friend as we were sitting comfortably at the bar. The one fellow made good suggestions for me on scotch and for her on red wine. We were both very happy with recommends. Obviously very knowledgeable on everything they serve.

Probably won't go back for the tapas as often but love the atmosphere for an evening drink with a friend. Great mature crowd. 

Cheers!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Wow wow wow! I can't believe how long I waited to try this place. What an amazing experience we had on date night. Make a reservation and go, ASAP! This tiny spot is so intimate and I was amazed by what they did in this space. Glen was personable, not condescending or pretentious like some other people in the restaurant business. We surrendered control and said ""feed me."" This allows the lovely ppl at tzin to choose tapas for you. We told Glen ""I don't like olives, he doesn't like mayonnaise based sauces, we love seafood. We're hungry."" And they did the rest. This allows you to eat things that aren't even on the menu and to see their creativity flow. Highly recommend, and will be back. Thanks Glen!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I don't know how can I describe it!
It's like the most satisfying food experience I had.
It gives a weird feeling which is somehow a combination of all best satisfactions I ever had! 
The atmosphere is awesome!
The best staff you can ever imagine!
And the food! Reminds me of zoomanity in Vegas and the best foods I ever had!!!!
I loved the food!
Hands down, they have the best chef in Edmonton!
If you have ever seen the animation ""ratatouille"", I had the same experience as the food critic in the movie!
Only instead of my childhood I had some other pleasant feelings while eating the food!
We picked the ""feed me"" option so I really don't know what I had.
I know the first two dishes were fishes and they were both amazing followed by some meat balls which were again amazing. Then some falafel which was way better than any falafel I have had in the best Arabic restaurants and then there was this thick bacon on bread with some maple syrup and more stuff!
And we finished our amazing experience with a chocolate cake which was melting as soon as it was in my mouth.
The experience was really good!
I will definitely go back there.
The place is very small so it's better to make reservations in advance.
It may look a little pricey but it totally worth it.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Very good food, excellent wines, and great service. We had six dishes. The smoked duck over coleslaw with cherry chutney and the creamed mushrooms with a puff pastry cracker were the stars. The lamb meatballs were ok, and the beef skewers were disappointing---lacking flavor and salt, and a little dry. But the other dishes, the chocolate dessert, great wine, and service made up for this. Though it is about 10% overpriced, we will be back.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Ordered a platter of deli meat and cheese and waited an hour and still didn't arrive, we ended up leaving. With the prices they have I'd expect better service for such a tiny place",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I LOVE Tzin!! My favourite wine bar in the world thus far (ok, so I haven't gone to all that many), Tzin is a tiny and intimate spot that's just bursting with good food, good wine, good staff, good decor and good atmosphere. 

Tzin is going for excellent quality in small doses, from their 10 item (but delicious) tapas menu to their 1 bathroom that looks like something out of a home decor magazine for the rich. Expect to be crammed in and not have much elbow room, but expect it not to really matter as you enjoy the company of good friends and the knowledgeable and friendly advice of the servers and owners. 

The wine menu changes frequently, so be ready to try something new - the servers have a wealth of information and are great at helping wine newcomers like myself find something new they'll enjoy every time. If you're hungry, go for the steak or mushroom crostini - both are heavenly. 

The one concern is that Tzin isn't cheap - while it's easily affordable if you want just one (half) glass of wine, if you're planning to make a night of it there or to eat enough tapas to constitute dinner, things may get expensive fast.

That said, it's definitely worth the expenditure, as the quality found at Tzin is difficult to find even at places that cost far more.  Just one word of advice: show up early if you actually want to get seats - Tzin is relatively full of the after-work crowd until about 7pm, but then fills up for  the evening by 9:30 (but they do take reservations).",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I had never even heard of this place. My boyfriends boss had mentioned it to him so we decided to make a date night out of it. I felt a little silly when i realized it was on my favourite street and that I had walked passed it a few hundred times.

It is squeezed between the ally and the lovely wine shop just off jasper Ave and 104th. The room fits 18-20 people, which was perfect as it allows for a more personal feel. There is 4 staff and the host, the owner is amazing. She is a Drama major and she defiantly lets it out. So enthusiastic and personable, she makes you feel like the only person in the room and she knows EVERYTHING about what they serve from the drinks to the food. 

Because I is Wine and Tapas i asked for a recommendation. she will ask what you usually like and give you some amazing recommendations. my first glass was a sparkling wine with black current added too it. the flavour changes as you drink it. best bubbly I have EVER had. My second glass was a white wine, notes of elderflower and white peach with an aftertaste of pink grapefruit. to die for. 

We ordered 1 dish and told her to just bring anything out after that and we would try it. here is our review of the food;

Grilled Chorizo Sausage
Smoked Garlic Aioli, Jalapeno Jelly, Violet Mustard, Baguette
When she brought this dish out she placed it on our table in a smile direction because ""your food should always smile back""  the sausage was amazing, not overly spicy and very flavourful. The garlic Aioli was my favourite sauce, then the violet mustered followed by the jelly!

Bacon
Maple Balsamic Apple Compote, Apple Mayonnaise, Crostini, Calvados Gastrique
This was the best bacon i have EVER had, super thick cut on a sliced crostini that was baked in the bacon fat topped with apple ""relish"". we had to take a second to recover after the explosion of flavour! this is a must get!!!!!!

Grilled Alberta Beef Flat Iron Steak
Applewood Smoked Sea Salted Caramel, Bourbon & Herbed Mushrooms
Okay before I say anything, I did not know steak could melt in your mouth! the combination of smoke and caramel was, mmmmmyummmm, steak is rare and omg I cant get over the feel and flavour of the meet. I could eat this all day everyday and never get over the feeling. must try this!!!!!!

Nicoise Frittata
Yellow Fin Tuna Carpaccio, Farm Fresh Eggs, Green Beans, Mixed Baby Potatoes, Olive Salsa, Anchovy Dressing, Potato Gaufrettes
I hate fish. I LOVED this. I loved this fish so much I actually just took the tuna off and ate it :) the little chips on top are amazing and the flavour combination is to die for!

Harissa Prawns
Chili & Garlic Marinated, with Harissa Butter
Massive prawns. perfectly cooked, exact amount of spice and creaminess. perfect end to dinner. 

I cant find the dessert we had on the site but I will do my best to describe it. it was a chocolate mousse on a chocolate Cookie crumb base with an almond crunch and whipped topping, drizzled with what I believe was raspberry puree. YUM! it was gone in seconds!!!!

If you have never been here you MUST go! perfect date spot. and the host was amazing, I cant wait to go back for the food but also her lovely personalty! Best restaurant in Edmonton.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Great romantic and quaint setting. This restaurant is one of the handful of restaurants that make 104 St THE best street in Edmonton. 

The owners are part of the staff which makes the service stupendous! 

They have a lovely wine selection and freshly made espressos for after. Their cheese board with meats is very unique and delicious and carries all naturally produced and locally made selections. Our server was well versed on where each thing on out board came from and what to expect in your first bite. 

The restaurant is small, which would normally be unfortunate because I've had to go elsewhere, however it's the cozy quaintness that is one of my favourite things. You feel like you're just one of a couple handfuls of people who got lucky that night to be guest.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I've lived on 104 street for a number of years, yearning to try this wine bar. Me and my friend were greeted warmly, and the owner explained that the wine and food is color coordinated to match (neat idea). They let you try tasters of wine before ordering a glass and help you pick a wine to your preference. 

However, after the great initial impression I was startled to see a fly floating in my wine. I'm a server, so I try not to make a big deal about these things, so I politely asked for a new glass. The server, I felt gave me little attitude for pouring me a new glass and frequented our table less afterwards.

The food was less than impressive. We started of with the baked brie and berries with a wine red reduction. The fruit was sweet and tender, however the cheese had the consisentency of a runny egg and was way too overseasoned with salt and pepper. 
Next we tried the pork ribs with potatoe salad. The ribs were very tender but lacking flavor, and the sauce surrounding the ribs was a mere drizzle. The potatoe salad was probably the best dish I had all night, with apples and bacon in a tangy sauce. For dessert we had a frozen mouse "" to fight over', our waitress told us. It had a nice texture, but ultimately not flavorful enough(beyond the taste of dark chocolate) to be worthy of a fight.

Despite our initial service, the owner was very enthusiastic about the dishes and the atmosphere of the bar is quite unique. I would suggest trying it out once, but ultimately I won't be back again.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
What a fabulous evening!  We're sooo glad we let restaurant decide our meal.  The food and wine pairings were gorgeous and the service top notch!,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I've meant to go to Tzin for years; it looks so compelling! A tiny space with an open view of the kitchen, on trendy 104th Street, tapas, wine, a historic building: what's not to love? When my SO invited me to date night here, I was thrilled. It's about time!

The space seats about 20 people, including its tiny bar. High ceilings and historic details make the ambiance very ""downtown"" indeed.  Immediately after being seated, our server came by and took his time explaining the tapa menu. Shortly after, the manager/owner (?) came by and followed up on our wine order. Both gentlemen served us throughout the night, and were incredibly friendly and helpful. 

The food was excellent, too! We ordered the patatas bravas, a dish of warm, spicy fried potatoes with aioli, and the lamb meatballs. Both were delicious, offering rich flavour and a touch of heat. For dessert, we opted for the flourless chocolate cake, which was divine. It was less like a cake and more like a slice of a rich ganache, very dark and creamy. The almond candy sprinkled on the top set the dessert off - yum!

Tzin isn't cheap; a bottle of wine, two tapas and a dessert runs over $100, but the service, atmosphere and quality of food is worth the price. Ultimately, Tzin wound up being the cozy, intimate, hip nook that I hoped it would. I will definitely be back!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Passed by Tzin many times without realizing it's there, finally went to try this tiny but awesome wine and tapas bar. Tasted 4 tapas dish and each single one is delicious and portioned just right. Highly recommend letting the owner picking the wine pairing, I don't know how he does it, but he seems to know what wine I would like better than myself. Definitely made into my top 5 restaurants in E-town, make sure you make a reservation, they only have less than 1o tables,",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This place caught my eye as I was walking down 104th Street. It looked very unique and it drew me in.

It's a cozy spot with black furnishings and beautiful burgundy walls with black trim. There are huge windows on one wall covered with gold curtains with burgundy details. Along the wall with the windows is a long bench seat with lots of decorative throw pillows along the back. 

Just inside the door is the tapas kitchen area. At the back of the establishment is an impressive wine bar. 

I was fortunate to get a table in the nearly full hot spot. The sommelier, whom I expect was also the owner, recommended the Casa Girelli Syran which is a Sicilian red wine. I was very pleased with the selection. 

I felt very inspired by this place. I could see myself writing here. 

This would be a great place to take a date you're trying to impress.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Where to start, all the food here was pretty good but actually quite forgettable, nothing really stood out. Let's start with the Bacon which comprised of maple balsamic apple compote, apple mayonnaise, crostini, calvados gastrique. Probably the best tasting thing here because, well, bacon. The fish dish was cod? I don't know, it was ok but not great. The paella was not bad and was devoured pretty good. The paella had piri piri marinated shrimp, sauteed mushrooms, piperade, gremolata aioli all on top of saffron rice. Aioli on this was really good, aioli in general is really tasty. The size of this dish is made for 2 but i found it quite small and didn't meet it's 36 dollar price point. Not pictured here is the Caldereta de pescado. It was red snapper & shrimp poached in lobster broth, potatoes, calamari rings, clams, tomato & white wine broth, ""TZiN Bay"" cr√®me fraiche. This was one of the better dishes but tasted more like just the white wine and nothing else and it was also pretty small at 27 bucks. We had a couple other dishes but they were so forgettable that it's not worth mentioning.

Located in a dark closet on 104, this place is easy to miss. This place is actually really small, sits probably 20 max people. If you go here you're essentially paying quite a bit of money to eat in a dark closet. This place is a good place to impress a date or just feel good about coughing up dough for mediocre food. 

Sal says: Just try it.
Julia says: progression of the tasting menu was not ideal. Would go back to try some of the other dishes on the menu.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Everyone has to try the bacon dish and no one should try the paella.   It was fantastically surprising how amazing the bacon was, we actually ordered a second round.  The mushroom salad was warm bright and delicious, I would order these 2 things again.  The steak bites were tough and the 2 dips were boring. I have never had a bad paella until we came here. The fish was so fishy that I suspect it was old and it left a bad aftertaste, I feel like they book the rice without the seafood, they just topped the dish with clams, whitefish and some mayo based sauce. . We ordered the Chef feed me  option and expected to be wowed . After all the hype about tzin I can't say I would go back and kind of disappointed .  Our bill was about $350, for 6 people who had no alcohol!  We just had water!!! But we gave it a shot!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"If you don't know by now, Tzin Wine and Tapas on 104 St in downtown Edmonton is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Of all time. Not only is the food always delicious, the staff there are the definition of hospitality. There was a time when Joe and I went nearly every month and with us trying to eat out less and new restaurants opening all the time, Tzin slowly became a once in a while treat. We were able to visit earlier this month, and although it has taken me this long to write about it, the food still makes me drool just thinking about it.

The menu gets updated almost every couple of months, but hopefully this is still available. The grilled chorizo sausage is housemade with Irving Farm pork, with my first taste of it in the hot pot alongside tomatoes and gnocchi when I first started writing. It was nice to see it featured on its own, with simple sides of smoked garlic aioli, jalapeno jelly, and a violet mustard. A ""deconstructed hotdog"", in Chef McGuire's words. My favorite topping was the jalapeno jelly, and although similar in concept to Dadeo's infamous green jelly, definitely packing more heat and not as sweet. Tzin needs to start selling these in the alleyway, honestly.

Second to arrive was the baked brie with red wine reduction, a dish that has been on the menu since I've started dining here. With good reason too because it's one of my favorites. Although the dish has evolved in presentation in the past visits, it's still oozing creamy goodness. I much preferred the apple and Saskatoon berry compote on the side though! I like my cheese pure!

New on the menu for the month was a braised duck leg. It was super moist and beautifully done. The roasted and smoked potato puree stood out though and alongside the lentils, it was a solid accompaniment to the duck.

Three dishes is our usual and we always save room for dessert. That night featured panna cotta stuffed poached pear and a chocolate mousse tart. I really couldn't decide between the two. I'm a chocolate lover, no doubts about that, but a refreshing, palate cleanser like a sorbet or lemon tart will always win me over. A panna cotta stuffed poached pear sounded interesting, but was it refreshing? My indecisiveness and Joe's indifference led us to allow Chef McGuire to choose the dessert for us. Surely he had a favorite. This is what happened next...

Both were served! Ahh why must you do this to me?! One bite of each and I could understand why though. Both had their merits and both would make me want to order more. The poached pear, served cold, was surprisingly very refreshing and the panna cotta, not heavy. It wasn't overly sweet either which is my preference for desserts! A ""cake waffle donut"" was served on the side, a cute concept. Moreso on the cake donut side, in a waffle shape, made from almond flour which makes it a fantastic gluten-free option for guests! Joe's favorite was the chocolate mousse, which we've had before. This time though, it was served with a chocolate cooking crumb crust and almond brittle. I really had to fight him for the last bite! (I already finished off the poached pear, haha!) Chef McGuire even remember Joe's ""allergy"" to peanuts and asked if the nuts were okay before plating. If you don't call that hospitality, I really don't know what is. Good call on both desserts!

Every meal ends with a quote slip with the bill. This particular quote was quite fitting for the night. Tzin Wine and Tapas, I will never forget what you did or said, and definitely never forget that you guys make me feel so happy! Food is superb, as always, and the service remains A+ as the team hasn't changed one bit. Except for Melissa's hair, which is now a short, chic bob! (She's the fabulous, upbeat server you will have alongside the equally fabulous Kelsey, owner of Tzin). Much thanks to Chef McGuire, as well as Sous Chef Greene, for the meal (and desserts!). Strongly considering ordering both desserts now for future meals. Maybe one to go.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Is it just me or does being on 104st make you feel like Edmonton is getting a little bit cooler?
I was on the patio at Tzin this last Friday after work. I was impressed by the chic yet casual vibe of the restaurant. The service was excellent; I hadn't had such great servers in a while. It actually felt like they were interested in you as a person, more than a customer to feed and kick out to make room for the next one. 
I thought that the tapa selection was really interesting. As a low carb eater I was able to enjoy one of them guilt free. I did however find that the servings could have been bigger for the price. 
The bathroom amenities were impressive. Having access to different toiletries should you need them is greatly appreciated by a lot of women.
All in all, a great little restaurant. I'd go back anytime.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"We choose the ""feed us"" option, where they just bring you food until you're full. We didn't have any dietary restrictions so they were free to bring whatever their hearts desired. Each course looked beautiful and was described to us as it was served. Wines were recommended based on our preferences and food. The atmosphere was fairly quiet, very intimate with around ten tables in total. The service was exceptional.

This was a treat. Not cheap, but a wonderful date night.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"READ THIS:
I don't usually write reviews but I have taken some time to write this strongly worded review! Tzin Wine and Tapas, is AMAZING!¬† What a charming little spot. At 6 foot 240 lbs my frame is proof enough I enjoy my food. I've been privilege enough to try fine dining all over, New Orleans, New York, Pheonix, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo, Bankok,¬† the list goes on and on. The fact that I found this little diamond in the rough in my home town thrills me. I have been to this establishment twice now.¬† Both times the service and food have been nothing short of perfect! I really struggle to describe this dinning experience other than just a all around great experience. Atmosphere is a 10, the owners are fantastic with the wine and whiskey suggestions, the food is such a treat, a great mix of surf and turf options! From conversations I have had while enjoying the food it is obvious to me the source a great deal of their food locally,¬† the sausage and side bacon from a farm near the city I believe. The kitchen staff make cheese, jelly, mustard,¬† and sauces in house all put together by someone with a passion for great food. I even found out some of the staff volunteer with local organizations teaching cooking. Anyways, I hope this review has you picking up your shoes and running out the door to try this spot out for yourself.¬† If you want to leave a restaurant with a smile on your face, your taste buds tingling and your cheeks hurting from smiling this is the place to do it. The last time I left with a group of 3 friends all food and drink lovers. We stepped onto to side walk looked at each other and said ""When are we doing this again?"" I'm sure¬† you have the exact same experience!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Met up with friends at Tzin on their suggestion early on one fair and foul summer day, looking for fine wine and divine dishes, and a warm environment. Tzin comes close to meeting my highest expectations, so 4 stars for above average and recommended. Just be prepared for the price range.

Tzin is a cozy narrow nook of a restaurant, a bit tight if you're more than a table of two, but very modern, clean and warm in it's own way. The owners make a point of welcoming people and making them feel at ease; one went out of her way to find a red wine that would be to my taste, not an easy task. I'd love to go back for wine tasting again, and maybe a nibble. 

The food overall was really good, although don't know if I'd call it tapas, more like appies at entree price to be honest. The flat iron steak was just excellent, but the spinach and gruyere tart was not that impressive, quite muted, and overwhelmed by mushrooms. Not just truffle oil, but a large topping of mixed saut√©ed mushrooms, which while tasty overwhelmed the other flavours in the tart. The pastry itself was perfect, light and delicately crispy. 

Everything at Tzin is expensive, particularly the food, so for me it would be a once or twice a year extravagance. Take a look at the online menu to avoid in-house sticker shock. Still I really liked the space and the service, and would love to hit Tzin after work to wind (wined?) down. A few half glasses of wine at $6 each is not too bad if relaxing and tasting is your interest. I also didn't get a chance to try their desserts, so I made my bf promise we'd go back just for that. Definitely worth a visit, but don't come expecting to quell a huge appetite on a budget.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Wonderful experience! A busy Saturday night for this spot and yet it felt like a cozy, comfortable dinner at a friends place. We ordered the chef tasting menu and had our wines paired by our server and I'm glad we did because we both thoroughly enjoyed each dish. I feel that the attention we received from our server is the reason our meal and experience was spot on. He listened to our needs and asked us questions to find out what we didn't like. No surprises here, just delicious food and superb wine. You won't be disappointed.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
An absolute favourite!! Delicious foods in a warm and inviting atmosphere. Knowledgeable staff. Allergy friendly. Great service.,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Me and a friend split some tapas before the symphony. The place is quaint...you feel like home in it. Make sure that you reserve because you may out of luck. If you are flexible with eating, then I would suggest you just allow the chef to pick out the food for you. All of it is delicious. We split the wild mushroom tart, the salmon with beet puree, the wild boar meatballs, and the bacon crostini. ALL was delicious. My favourites were the wild boar meatballs and the crostini. Great wine selection and our server did a great job picking out wines for us.  It looses a star because I found a few things a little pricey...for example if you look at my photos...26 dollars for one small piece of salmon without any sides is a  little on the tipping point.  Just be prepared to spend a chunk of change, and then you won't be disappointed.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"If I could live in Tzin everyday, without becoming a total wine-and-tapas hedonist, I would. Just knowing a place like Tzin exists in our city, makes me love it a little bit more. 

Whenever I'm craving great wine and delectable food, served in an intimate and decadently draped hollow, located on 104 St (next to deVine Wines) I now know where to go to satiate the lover and tzinner in me.

The owner, Glen, knows not only his wines, but your wines. He listens to what you like, then if you're open to his picks, he will take you on a tour de grapes you won't soon forget! 

For me, he chose the 2004 Gloriosa Rioja, forever altering my view of the Spanish red. Next, the Glen Carlou Grand Classique from South Africa, followed by Dierberg Three Saints Syrah (U.S.A.) Both: exquisite. 

Then he poured a glass of the Petit Syrah Rosenblum 2006 and I fell a little deeper in love. All of this, with tasty tapas, including sirloin and mushroom crostinis and a delicious antipasto platter. If you're looking for a special place to hold a small, intimate gathering, this is perfect. Also great for a third date or anniversary. Reserve to avoid disappointment. It doesn't take much to fill this place - seems lots of other Edmontonians also love living in tzin.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"My fianc√© and I, along with another couple had dinner at Tzin, and were blown away by the food and service. Glen, was very helpful selecting dishes and suggesting wine. We were never rushed, even though the place is small and you would think they'd be eager to have people in and out. 
We'll be back soon and often. Love this place.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Sometimes when I see these little places I'm skeptical but this place is the real deal. Very small, I knew that going in but I was still taken aback how small. I had made reservations thank god because if you hadn't planned ahead there's no way you'd get it. The place was packed the whole time we were there! We asked them to feed us, but we added that we did actually just kind of want to try all the things on the menu. So they just started bringing out all these amazing dishes for us - starting with devilled eggs whipped with beets and topped with an itty bitty anchovy. Amazing - and I very much despite devilled eggs lol. From there we received salmon with charred green onions - the skin! Ah! Then the falafel, the mushroom gnocchi (which is to die for, I'm so glad we shared it between 5 of us because there's no way I could eat more than a few bites and eat anything else) chorizo spring rolls with an apolitical dipping sauce that were so decadent and rich and spicy, some incredible 5 spice pork belly with creamy grits that tasted like risotto and then we were tapping out so they asked if we would prefer dessert or the Bacon To finish and we chose the bacon which was AMAZING we were all licking the gastrique off the plate - so good. Everything was very rich and delicious- great for sharing with a group so you can try a bunch of different things! The lighting is low so our pictures do not do the food justice but everything is incredible, the food, the wine, the service. I'll be back!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Sadly, I have no photos.  I can honestly say that as each dish arrived we were digging in and no one wanted to wait for me to take a photo. 
We've only been here once.  We will go back for sure. 
The service was super warm, attentive and informed. 
We tried several dishes and each one was savoury or exquisite or a salty (in a good way) delight.  The mushrooms are amazing, the bacon thing, and the lamb meatballs were perfectly done with well-suited accents. 
The wine list is a good size.  We did not try dessert so cannot comment.  The size is cozy, the decor dark, warm and with attention to detail. The kitchen is sort of in the open which I always love, I have a lot of respect for establishments that are comfortable and confident about letting us see the food preparation.  I really can't wait to go back. 
Street parking, you might have to park a few blocks away...",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Wow, I don't know why it took me so long to write about Tzin Wine & Tapas (major procrastination) but I went here a few months ago with a friend on a Saturday and had a great evening. The place is dark and small but has a very warm and inviting feel to it. The place was absolutely packed when we arrived. Interesting note - how the kitchen is literally in the front of the restaurant! Guess space is at a premium.

Anyways, on to more important things - the food and wine. I'm no wine expert but my friend is and we both ordered pairings for our three shared dishes. The wines are very reasonably priced by the glass.

Wine
- Vina arbodela ($6.50)
- Sequana pinot noir ($6.75)
- Noble tree zinfandle (5.75)
- Lixa Alvarinho ($6.00)
- Seguin manuel burg ($6.00)
- Something else white which I don't remember

Food
- Cheese board ($18.50) - comes with three different types of cheese, bread, olives,and compotes. Can't remember the exact cheese now but they were all very distinct. Olives were so good.
- Kale and quinoa ($16.00) - delicious! Wish I could make my own kale and quinoa creations taste this good.
- Pork shoulder ($18.50) - super tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness.

Definitely an awesome place to take a date! Service was fantastic - both the sommelier and waitresses were top notch. I will definitely be back for more. GO now, what are you waiting for!?!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Complete gem in the middle of downtown! Please trust Glen with his own menu that is pasted on how hungry you are and what you don't like. You won't be disappointed! (Also, I'm completely under describing the following.)

Black clod that cuts like butter... ""better than you pork belly"" tapas served with apple brandy reduction, grilled lamb skewer with perfectly paired Harissa and romesco sauces.... the list goes on. 

Oh wait did I forget about the amazing priorat I drank! I guess the food actually made me forget the wine (for half a second)!
.....

1 year later...

""I'll start with a white""
""Dry?""
""Remind me what you don't like to eat""

And done. No ordering needed. Everything was wonderful and pared wonderfully.. No wondering through menus, knowing you will be taken care of and at a reasonable price.  I wish there where more restaurants like this.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Located in a tiny room next to deVine Wines and Spirits, Tzin Wine and Tapas literally has enough room for seven two-top tables (two people per table). That, plus a short bar, plus a corner kitchen area, constitutes the entire restaurant.

It's quite dark inside, with tabletop candles and Spanish music playing in the background - perfect for a first date, a hundredth date, or drinks with close friends and co-workers. Not, on the other hand, a family-friendly restaurant; I wouldn't recommend bringing any children here.

The wine list was quite extensive, as I expected it to be, and offered a variety of by-the-glass choices, and just as many by-the-bottle options. I tasted two red wines during my visit: the Ben Marco Malbec, Argentina (hints of blackcurrant and slightly acidic) and the Pasion Brava Tempranillo (Rioja), Spain (much sweeter, very smooth drinking). No matter your wine preference, Tzin has a variety of options to suit every taste, and the excellent service ensures that your wine glass is always topped up.

Tzin offers a typical tapas-style menu: a selection of small-ish dishes with a strong foundation in Spanish cuisine. Diners can either select several to share amongst their party, or choose one or two for themselves. Everything (and I mean everything) sounded delicious, so it was difficult to make a decision.

In the end, I decided to try the Olive Plate to start, since I love pairing marinated olives with wine. Alongside the olives, the plate boasted a selection of focaccia bread, olive tapenade, and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, all of which were delectable. The warm marinated olives were delicious and went extremely well with my glass of Ben Marco.

For dinner, we decided to order separate dishes, and opted for the Chorizo and Gnocchi Stew and the Chicken Breast Supreme. The stew, served with grilled flat bread, was absolutely heavenly and had a weighty tomato taste that complemented the manchego gnocchi and chorizo exceptionally well. The chicken breast dish was moist and tender, and was served on a bed of harissa couscous and dried apricots, with a dollop of minted yoghurt. Harissa is a Tunisian hot chili sauce, so the couscous understandably had a bit of a kick to it; if you don't like spicy foods, I'd advise you not to choose this dish. The spiciness isn't overpowering, but it'll set your mouth tingling if you eat enough of the couscous.

We had excellent service throughout our entire visit - the server was very friendly and accommodating - and enjoyed the chic d√©cor, open-style kitchen, and gigantic wine rack (my next purchase).

One of the things I like best about Tzin is that they're all about the dining experience. This restaurant is about relaxing, enjoying a good glass of wine, and sampling delicious appetizers and tapas plates. They're a hole-in-the-wall restaurant simply for this reason; if they were to enlarge the space and cram in as many tables as possible, they'd lose much of the charm they get from the currently intimate, personal dining experience. 

If you work downtown, if you enjoy wine and tapas, or, hell...if you live in Edmonton...you need to make a date to visit Tzin sometime soon. As I've said, and as their website stresses, they're a small restaurant, so please make the most of OpenTable and book yourself a place. Then all you need to do is sit back, quaff some wine, nibble on an appetizer, and simply experience.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Tiny place in the heart of downtown, although during the summer they have a small patio which adds a few more tables. This is definitely a place for small, intimate dinners; they can probably only fit one group of any size in on a given night, so if you do want to bring a few friends, make reservations and pick a quiet week night! 

I came here with a wine tasting meetup group and that's definitely a strong point of this location. The owner was happy to recommend wines or just surprise us with a tasting flight (three glasses each) and his choices were excellent. The menu is small but delicious looking, but you also have the option of simply telling the owner ""you choose"", tell him what kind of things you like and what you want to spend, and he'll just keep bringing things out. Delicious things. Very delicious things. Our group had a great time trying wines and shared appetizers and on a Tuesday evening the place wasn't crowded, so we didn't feel any rush to free up the tables. Great experience, good for a date or special occasion.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
Great service and ambience!! We got to sit both inside-very cosy and outside!!!  It was a very nice 30 degree day and we were offered a patio table as That was my preference and something opened up. Owners are lovely and personable. Amazing seafood and tapas! Definitely will be a place to visit again.,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Love this little cozy wine bar.
Great selection of wine and apps to share.
Service is always impeccable! 
one of my favourite date spots, highly recommended.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"We wanted to celebrate somewhere really special, so we chose to go to Tzin for their wine & tapas. This intimate spot has been on 104 St for 15 years & is dark, sexy and perfect for date nights. 

The service is amazing - attentive without being overbearing or insincere. They go out of their way to make everyone who walks in feel welcome & comfortable. You can order off the menu or try the Feed Me option - tell them how hungry you are, any dislikes/allergies and let the kitchen surprise you. Dishes are meant to be shared, with or without wine. They even text you a picture of all the wines you're served at the end of your meal!

We loved every dish we ate, paired perfectly with a wine (until we stopped the wine & were made a delicious lemonade to finish the meal). Every texture, taste - it all married together beautifully and we were so satisfied by the end! They're most famous for ""THE bacon"" but I promise, there are so many more treasures on this menu to discover. 

It's been a while since I've been back and it's as wonderful as I remember it. Highly highly recommend.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg

I recently visited with a group of girlfriends, it is very small, so a reservation is definitely recommended. We followed the advice of the server on wine and food and were not disappointed. The wine selection was great and the recommendations we were given were thoughtful and on point.  As a group, we decided to go with the ""feed me"" option, our server asked us what we did and didn't like and surprised us with 6 tapas to share as a table.  Everything we had was delicious!  I can't wait to return!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"After a long hiatus, Tzin was our ""Friday Night Culinary"" adventure spot :-)  I will admit, we visited back in December, yes, December. To say it has been a hectic several months, IS an understatement :-/

With the above said, I am glad to write this review as we had a very nice food related evening :-)  Since being here in 2012, Tzin has changed things up on the menu such that there is a ""sampler"" style menu with sharing dishes.  This was nice given the new dishes we noticed.  We ordered the Mushroom Tarta, Quinoa Salad, the Tuna Amuse, and the Lingcod to share.  They were all well prepared and the right size given that we then wanted to have our own desserts.  I ordered the Almond Cake and my companion the Chocolate Cake.

The flavours of our dinner were all very present, but not overwhelming.  The Quinoa in particular, had a citrus flavour as well as a nutty taste that weren't competing or strong.  I do have to say, my favorite was the Lingcod.  Broiled, it was very nicely plated with a slightly spicy aioli.  

The one complaint I do have is the DOOR :-P  Similar to Woodwork, when it is winter and yes, anywhere less than 0 Celsius, when that door opens it has the capacity to kill what you are enjoying on your plate. In this regard, hope for a seating closer to the bar, to the right.  Even though they have the thick drape to protect its patrons, unfortunately, it isn't enough in my opinion.  It won't stop me from going, however, this being said, I am going to shoot for going for sure when the temperature rises :-)",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This is the best restaurant in Edmonton. I honestly can't say enough good things. The food, service and atmosphere were all amazing. AMAZING.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"The biggest surprise walking into Tzin was how small the place actually was. There are maybe 7ish tables for 2 (maybe 3), and when you're sitting in pairs you're quite close to the next pair.  I personally don't have a problem with this but I know this could be an issue for some people.  

While the wine list isn't crazy long, there appeared to be a good selection of the different types of wine. The nice thing was that the wines and food were color coded to help you match them together if you wanted the ""best"" pairing.

Food was quite good. As the name states, this place only serves tapas, so smaller plates, almost like appetizers. We had the chorizo and Gnocchi stew, seafood paella, and grilled berkshire pork loin with warm potato salad. The stew and the seafood paella were very good, quite unique.  The pork loin was recommended but we found the rib to be just a tad dry and bland compared to other ribs we've had before. Not that it was terrible, just didn't compare to the other dishes. The warm potato salad was also very good.

Our server (and I suspsect the owner) Glenn gave excellent service and suggestions.   Very friend and he made the experience great!  Would definitely go back to try other things.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I've dined at this restaurant numerous times- yesterday was such an awful experience. My reservation was for 7, arrived on time and waited at the door with my friend for 30 minutes. Fine not a big deal, but I made a request to sit at a table (that had just cleared) and not at the bar and was denied because apparently I've cancelled reservations there before (never no showed but legitimately cancelled ahead of time). The server was incredibly rude and actually punished me because I had cancelled reservations. He never took into account the numerous times I had dined there, sent friends there, and spent a considerable amount of money there. To sum up, a terrible experience- but all was not lost, uccellino was happy to serve us and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner. Tzin lost a customer and likely all the people I'll tell about their service.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Great little place with owners who actually care about food and wine and are proud of what they do.
The food is creative, delicious and proficiently cooked from excellent ingredients, in small, home-like, pots and pans. It makes a difference.
The wine selection is excellent, the owners have vast knowledge and experience, especially in Spanish wines. A rarity in Edmonton.
The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious.
The whole feeling from this cosy place is that the owners have invited you over to their home to cook for you personally as opposed to the un-personal feeling you get when going to most restaurants.
I wish there were many more places like that!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Went here last night, wtih fellow yelpers.  Although this wine bar is sort of small it has a warm, homely, yet chic atmosphere about it.  Not too loud, decent music plays in the background and the occasional sound of grilling meat with eruptions of fat burning.  The wine selection is really good and they have a unique color coding of wines with corresponding food pairings, making it easy to get the most of your wine and tapas evening.

Now, the menu is exquisite with every tapas being intriguing, yet mouthwatering.  I do feel, however, that the list of tapas is quite small (perhaps 10 items) and is generally a big serving to be shared.  A good comparison can be made with Lalola Bar,  a generic tapas bar in San Francisco:
http://www.yelp.com/biz/lalola-bar-de-tapas-san-francisco-2

However, it is worth mentioning that for a small room that fits perhaps 7 tables, the menu is fine.  The steak crostinis (and mushroom crositins) were excellent and so was the antipasto platter.  The serving sizes were good too, for the price.  

Coming back to the wine, the server who also seemed to be the owner, knew a lot about his wines and served us some interesting wines (petite sirah, syrah, tasty blends, riojas etc.).  I think between us, we probably had 9-10 different wines, a few of which were the server's selections.  I didn't get a chance to try the hard liquors, but they seemed to have a small but good list of whiskies, vodkas, gins etc.  

Finally, it is worth saying a word or two about the washroom.  It's a single, common washroom which is loaded with personal accessories like, hairspray, tampons, hand lotions, mouthwash etc.; apart from the regular soap and toilet paper.  It sure feels like you're visiting someone's home!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I absolutely love this restaurant and have been a few times before.  The ambiance and the service make for a perfect evening out.

My boyfriend (who has never been) and I decided to go there last night for Edmonton Downtown Dining week and were blown away.  Their three course meal was impeccable, and I have nothing bad to say about the wine :P 

We had scallops for the first dish, then Irvings Farm's bacon slow roasted on Crostini bread with a maple apple topping for course 2, and both were presented beautifully and tasted just as nice.  Though, I have to say their flank steak with the caramel sauce was the shining star of our dishes, and I highly recommend!  We will both be back again soon!

Because of the size of the restaurant, I would say get reservations every time you want to go there.  They are also on open table to making resos or changing them is hassle free.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This place is great. The food is good, the wine list is great, the atmosphere is cool. It's so small it is like having your own secret hideout. Every time I go here I feel like Edmonton is getting to be a decent place to live.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I honestly can't say enough good things about this place....it was a wonderful experience to say the least:)

We had a small group of ladies, we were treated all night with excellent service that we all just kept saying ""I love it here!"".  They gave us some tasters of wine till we found one we liked, and they ended up running out of a selection so we ordered another and they gave us a discount, we ordered so much food and wine we left full and filled with happiness:)

We tried a few things so I will give a quick run down!

Braised Bacon- Absolute favorite! Could have ate this all night:)
Warm Wild Mushroom & Spinach Tart- MMMMmmm, so wonderful.
Jumbo Prawns- I would have eaten more of this but I was getting full, next time it's prawns and Bacon for me.
Grilled Alberta Beef Flat Iron Steak- Very tasty, it might be a bit red for some people but if you don't mind it's delish.
Charcuterie & Cheese-  This was good, but out of all of it....it was probably our least favorite.  It was just everything else was soooo good!!!!!

I can't wait to go back, this place it teeny tiny but so intimate and it is definatley a place you want to go out to treat yourself.  We had amazing service all night, and we all were beaming with delight when we left.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
The salad with olives. Baked brie. Beef tenderloin. Tzin's Kelsey and Glen. Get ready for the best night in town!,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service. Owner is a gem of a human being and clearly takes pride in quality. Will definitely be back!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Didn't get a chance to eat here as the owner was extremely rude and told us too leave upon arriving. We had a few drinks and was asked to leave. I would not waste your time here, rude owner means I spend my money somewhere else!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Cool place...small, cozy with character. Nice tapas menu and great service.  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  Great wine menu as well.  The wild mushshroom tart is outstanding.  I'll be back!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
Always a treat to eat here. Just grab a glass (or two) of wine and just let the chef's decide your dinner with the tasting menu. Can't go wrong.,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I can't say enough good things about Tzin. It was a very busy Friday night but they squeezed us in by letting us sit at the bar. The staff made our experience fun as they let us sample different wines and had lots of knowledge about the wines they serve. I love that they have 1/2 size glasses of wines at very reasonable prices, which allows you to try a couple of different wines during the meal. Although the wine was a highlight, the food was also really good. It's smaller portions that are good for sharing. The two of us shared 3 plates and had dessert and felt full at the end. The only complaint might be the size of the portions. Could be a bit bigger but the taste was excellent. We can't wait to go back.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"My experiences so far have only been OK. I've been here about three times now, still waiting to have the wow experience that everyone else keeps telling me I'm going to have! I've been making my way through the tapas menu and so far everything I've tried has been great.

Last night, I made some reservations for wine after dinner. We were seated quickly, no issue. We did not want to eat though, just wanted wine, and it seemed like our server did not like that. We tried to order a bottle of Zinfindal and all he said was, ""no."" We asked if they were out and he just kept saying, ""no"" with no explanation, so we had a bottle of Pino Noir. I was kind of confused there because this purported as a wine bar so is it so weird that guests would order wine?

Other than that the experience was pleasant! After some time our server kind of warmed up to us and was being a lot more friendly. The space is small, lovely and warm, and makes for some great ambiance. I'm all about small places like this. I also love sitting in close proximity because we got to engage with some other tables! There was a woman walking around taking care of tables as well and she was also very friendly!

In my prior visits here I ordered the patatas bravas which are the best! You can win my heart with that dish.

I read all these glowing reviews and feel a bit sad that mine haven't been the same. I think I will try a few more times though because the food and ambiance make it worth a shot.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I wandered into Tzin on Friday night and was instantly made to feel welcome by the wonderful crew there. Even though the place was packed, the beautiful and charming Kelsey convinced me to stay, found me a place at the bar, introduced me to fantastic locals and made me feel totally comfortable. The selection of food and wine was great, service impeccable and warm, I could have stayed all night.  I have travelled all over the world, Tzin has got a place in my Canadian top 10!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This review is based on phone customer service alone as our party did not make it into Tzin. Being an avid user of Yelp and seeing the exceptional reviews, I was excited to visit Tzin with a group of girlfriends for an evening of wine and tapas. Long story short, one of the ladies had not been feeling well and so we pushed back our reservation and in the end unfortunately had to cancel at late notice as she just was not feeling up to attend. 

I believe it is common courtesy to call and cancel a reservation regardless of how close to the reservation time it is. Upon calling I spoke with a male host. After apologizing for canceling the reservation so late the host proceeded to scold me for doing so. As a first time customer, this has cemented a terrible impression of what I'm sure is a very nice establishment. I understand that a table had been held for our small party, but I don't believe that this gives staff the grounds to treat customers with disrespect. 

With so many new wine and tapas bars opening in Edmonton that have good food and wine lists, customer service will become an integral part of choosing where to spend ones money. Unfortunately for our party, Tzin will not be our wine bar of choice until their customer service is addressed.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"On a whim, I took my boyfriend out for his birthday tonight... purely based on Open Table's ratings for this place. I have to say this was not only delicious, but also an experience. We did the ""Feed Me"" option, and we were very glad we did. It was a lot of fun not knowing what food would come out next... I also tried some things that were outside of my usual comfort zone.

It was hella expensive, $200 with tip for 2 people.... (with a $60 bottle of wine...) but this was definitely, as I said, an experience. Would I be back? Absolutely.... tomorrow? Probably not.... maybe another special event.

This place seats probably 20 people max, which makes it feel very intimate and exclusive. 

The service was lovely, I think we had one of the owners (the wife I presume). She was great and wanted to make sure we had a great experience.

Thank you!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Tzin is a cute little nook of a spot on 104 St. off of Jasper Ave.  I am impressed how well they have made use of the the little space they have.  The inside of the restaurant is cozy and nicely decorated.

Service was excellent and both our waiter and the sommelier, who turned out to be the owner, Glenn, offered really great suggestions.  When I mentioned I had been wanting to try Tzin for forever, Glenn was very gracious and thanked us for coming.

The food was melt in your mouth good.  The prices are high for the portion sizes, but you can't beat the flavours and quality!  We started with the Patatas Bravas ($14.50); what impressed me about this dish was the house made ""angry"" spice because I'm not heavy into spicy foods, but this dish had the perfect blend of spice that added to the flavour.  Next we had the Bacon ($16); this was my favourite thing that I ate at Tzin!  The thick cut bacon mixed with the maple balsamic apple compote was so delicious; actually lip smacking, lick the plate good.  You must try the Bacon!  Our third dish we tried were the Lamb Meatballs ($17), which again were excellent.  We rounded the evening off with the Chocolate Pot de Creme ($9), which was a nice balance of chocolate and creamy goodness; the dessert was actually quite big in size.

Next for the wine. I am not a connoisseur, and I do not claim to have a refined wine palate.  I do however love my sweet white wines, and I like to order whatever is recommended to me at the restaurant.  I had a glass of the Alsace Reserve Gewurtztraminer, which was a nice fruity sweet flavour, with a hint of dryness.  For my second glass I was feeling adventurous, and I asked for a red recommendation even though I thought of myself as someone who disliked reds.  I got to sample the Cherry Tart Pinot Noir before committing to a full glass, and I was impressed; I've never tasted a sweet red before, and I think I may have to purchase a bottle of it in the near future.

I am so happy I finally got to try out Tzin, and I can't wait to go back.  My only regret is that I didn't try it out sooner.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
Amazing service and amazing food. Couldn't say more good things about this place. The fabulous owner took care of us along with the amazing waiter and will absolutely be back. 10 stars,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I love this place! It's a small restaurant with only about 7 tables! Make a reservation! My boyfriend and i came here to celebrate five years together, we were treated very well, we didn't tell them we were celebrating anything, and they didn't ask but we were treated like we were very special! We looked at the menu and decided we wanted to try everything and found it hard to decide between just a few so we decided to go with the ""feed us"" option. The chef put together 5 dishes for us, a few from the menu and a few that weren't! I told them i wasn't a fan of mussels and crab but fish was fine.
First we had a home made FISH sausage!! This was SO tasty!! I have never had anything like this and it was delicious. Second was cod with olive oil, lime served on a bed of something similar to risotto, but it wasn't risotto, it was amazing. This cod was like cutting butter it was so tender and amazing. Third we had mushroom tarte, i believe this dish is on the menu, i don't even know how to describe this, it was mushrooms and just SO tasty!!! Creamy and lovely! Fourth was the BACON dish that everyone raves about, let me tell you, it tasted like christmas in my mouth. It was juicy, full of flavor and just perfection. I had 1 and half out of the four and that was enough for me, it was a sweet dish, had maple syrup on it i believe. The last dish we had was sirloin skewers... another amazing. Cooked perfect, so tender. 
Everything we had was fantastic.
The tables are quite close together, when my boyfriend bit into the bacon and said ""mmmmm"" the table next to us looked over and laughed and said that they wanted what he was having. If you want a private conversation it may be hard to get in here unless you are at one of the higher tables or sitting at the bar. This does not bother me at all. It was lovely. We shared a bottle of red wine and i had one extra glass instead of a dessert afterwards. Our bill was reasonably priced, for tapas and wine was $180. I think this is reasonable for the quality of the food and the service. They made you feel like you were family here. Very welcoming.
We dressed up quite fancy, he was in a suit and i was in a dress and heels. There were couples in there that were just in jeans and a t-shirt. I don't think there is a dress code at all, come how you are i'm sure they will respect you no matter what! Just be prepared to be a little squished in as soon as you open the door!
I can't wait to go back for another celebration!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Tzin is A-MAZING! A hidden gem in Edmonton. The service is always amazing and the food is exceptional. The room only seats about 25 people so make sure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment! 

The restaurant is great for groups as the menu is Tapas style. I have tried most things on the menu now and everything is delicious. The flank steak with salted caramel sauce is to die for!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"There are not enough words so say how amazing our evening at Tzin was.   Glen looked after us and he looked after us so so well!  

It was my birthday and Glen made sure my nigh was amazing and it was!!

We chose to have them *feed us*.   I would suggest everyone do that but come hungry.   Each plate was as amazing as the next.   The bacon with maple syrup and calvados reduce apples - OMG.    Well everything was OMG!!   Dessert was decadent and the perfect finish to the meal.

The wine selection is fantastic.  And if you are unsure - you can count on them to suggest just the right one for your meal.

This was our first time there  - but it will not be our last!!!  

Thanks you!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Classy, comfortable, excellent food, service and atmosphere.  Just be prepared to wait for a seat!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Deuxi√®me visite en 8 mois ici. Les tapas sont succulents, le service est impeccable. Il y a 22 places assises, mais je n'avais pas r√©serv√© hier soir. D√©sormais, j'irai manger √† cet endroit √† chacun de mes passages √† Edmonton. Amener des amis qui y vont pour la 1re fois est un plaisir.

Tapas taste wonderful there. Try the Mapple bacon and enjoy. The servers are totally friendly and make you feel at home in this tiny 22 seats restaurant. Don't miss it!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Great little restaurant on 104st. Owner/Somm obviously takes great pride in this place. You can count on him to make sure a suitable wine will pair nicely with your meal. 

I think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. You can go very, very, very right by ordering the ""Bacon"" though.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"My boyfriend and I are regular customers here  and have never been disappointed by the food and service from the servers here! It's one of our favourite places to go for a date night. Kelsey (the owner) is impeccable with her table service and making you feel welcome - she has a soft-spoken voice but don't let that fool you - she's certainly lively and always has a smile on her face!  Melissa (who no longer works there) was just divine- full of energy and enthusiasm - we really do miss her as it's not quite the same without her presence there! As with everyone else who tries it, the Bacon dish is exceptional and perfectly prepared.... we've tried so many dishes there, almost everything off the menu, and many dishes off the menu (chef's tasting menu). We've also had the pleasure of being there for the New Years eve & Valentine's Day special seatings and the details of both respective nights were adorable - with decorations and props. I just love the atmosphere of this tiny gem and always recommend this to friends and coworkers who are looking for a nice evening out! 

Oh, I almost forgot, the desserts are amaaaaazing!  *sigh*",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Always friendly service, good drink recommendations (especially if you're not sure what you want) and overall good tapas. They always do their best to accommodate your group despite their small space. As such, I enjoy the weeknights for a quieter drink that some of the other bars downtown. Note that they are closes on Mondays. Great spot!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Localized seafood paella,nice ambiance .worth going but no worth going twice.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Has the paella recipe changed? Sadly, I think so. The first time I ate it I was blown away. I could taste the sea in the paella, and there was a generosity with the ingredients. The second time, which was recently, was very different, and a sad homage to the former paella. I think they use bouillon cubes instead of seafood stock because afterwards, my tongue had the MSG tingle, and I got a very big headache, something that always occurs when I eat MSG-laden food. Also, this isn't paella more than a risotto with shrimp and veggies sprinkled on top. Paella isn't creamy, risotto is. Finally, I think there's new ownership, and, as a result, a new menu but for the worse. I feel like the commitment to fresh local grown foods and high quality ingredients has been abandoned and as a result, I probably won't be back.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Went here one evening after hitting the night market on Jasper Ave and we were dressed way to casually for this place. We didn't have a reservation either but they were able to accommodate us! This little restaurant only seats about 12 tables plus a mini bar. The menu was surprisingly large for such a tiny place.. I was expecting at least 4 or 5 entr√©es but they had at least 8.. And not the same as what you see online. 

We shared the mushroom dish, which was a nice neutral balance of all flavours on the plate. The mushroom was plentiful and the sauce was generous. There was also a little cracker of some sort (forgive my lack of knowledge) placed between the mushroom and tower of arugula, that was salty, but went well with all the flavours. An excellent appetizer. 

Next up was the duck breast over waffles. The duck was tender, and cooked medium well, not dry. The pairing with waffle and cranberries was amazing! This was my favourite dish. Something completely different from any comparable restaurant and a must try. 5 stars for this dish alone. 

Overall, 5 stars for this place. If you haven't gone yet, go. Grab a date and have a lovely time. We will definitely be back.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Have been meaning to check this place out for a very long time. A co-worker mentioned how delicious it was so I quickly booked a table. Lucky to get a reservation. We had, tuna, sturgeon, Irving's pork, juicy meatballs, house-made sausage, creamy risotto, pillowy gnocchi. Service was great, so friendly and fast. Out on the patio for the a perfect evening!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
Fabulous night out! Loved the atmosphere & the dining experience was very unique. Our waitress had great wine recommendations that catered to everyone's varying tastes @ our table. I will definitely be back & have recommended Tzin to others :),2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Tzin is a cute, tiny, Spanish-meets-Alberta, Tapas bar with an equally adorable owner; who will attentively serve you great wine and great food with a great smile.

(As a special glimpse into the owners' sense of humor, Tzin is open until 11:03 PM on weeknights and 12:06 AM on weekends, on the dot). 

My colleague and I hit Tzin last week while on business in Edmonton at her insistence that I try it. I complied and was not disappointed.

Everything we ate was wonderful. Especially delicious were the tenderloin and the chocolate creme brul√©e. I am only sorry I didn't have room in my belly for more.

There is also a nice wine selection offered in 2oz, 6oz, 1/2 L and bottles.

A gem in downtown Edmonton, I was pleased to find a Tapas bar with some obviously Spanish-influenced dishes made with fresh, home-grown ingredients, a good wine list and a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

Tzin is quite small, but mighty, and I will definitively be making it my go-to place while in Alberta's capital.

T.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This place is amazing!  it is intimate,  great drinks,  and gluten free friendly which I am. This is a perfect date spot.   Make sure to make reservations as they are pretty small! Food is amazing btw we had the patatas bravas and the chick peas and we loved both!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I have no idea how to pronounce Tzin but I can tell you that it's great.

Tasteful decor and a great patio in the summer months.

The wine list is lengthy and complete. There's a malbec on there that will knock your socks off. Sweet, fruity, and robust.

The tapas are excellent and the entrees are definitely on my list. The baked brie is brought to life by balsamic vinegar, grapes, and some lovely bread. The charcuterie was plated and of good quality. The olive tapinade led me love olives again.

To top it all off, the service is excellent. The owners' made sure we enjoyed everything and paid us a few visits throughout the evening (and afternoon, the next day.)",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"3 of us stopped in before a concert recently and I can't say enough of this place. Atmosphere is fantastic, food is excellent and service was fantastic!  We enjoyed the ""feed us"" option where food just kept coming, including items not in the menu.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"We were at Tzin for my birthday last friday and it was to die for!

I really had no idea how small the place was.  I read it was small, but had no idea it was THAT small.  It's super cute, cozy, and comfortable, considering it's size.  I loved every inch of the place, though, and hope to go back again. 

We got there a touch early, and our table for six hadn't come up yet, so we were seated at the bar, poured complimentary champagne and wine until some seats opened up for us and Kelsey (the owner or manager?) treated us like we were close friends of her's.  

One resounding comment amongst our group was that the music was a bit too loud.  Subsequently, everyone in the room has to be loud, so the server couldn't hear our order, and we had to ask him to repeat himself when listing off the desserts.

That said - food - AMAZING (crab stuffed prawns, baked brie with pear/cran compote, and flourless choc. cake - YUM - YUM - YUM); the wine selection was impeccable, and the atmosphere is exactly what we expected.  A cool, chic, friendly little place I hope to visit again, and again, and again.

Tip to Yelpers - RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST.  We originally planned a party of ten, and I'm glad a couple people cancelled - we would have overwhelmed the place!  Go with an open mind (for those of you who think/call yourselves claustraphobic) and an empty stomach, and you won't be sorry.  Cheers!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Trying to find a unique wine bar, from out of town. Stopped in. Very cozy limited seating great service owner had a lot of great ideas for wine. I was able to buy a bottle at a very reasonable price along with some great Tapas. Would highly recommend, make sure you make a reservation as there are only 20 seats.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
A workmanlike adequacy to the dishes but no real magic. Interesting touches like deep fried arugula were cancelled out by little irks like having nowhere to put the knife and fork we were asked to hang on to all evening. I had hoped I'd found a gem to return to but I don't see a good reason -- having sampled pretty much everything on the menu I was sincerely underwhelmed. Maybe they were just tired.,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
Every time I am in Edmonton I always try to fit in a night at Tzin. The restaurant is small and welcoming and the food is to die for. The service has been fantastic every time i have been there. Glenn took the time to find the perfect wines to pair with our dishes and he did not disappoint. Make sure you try the Maple apple pork belly and the desserts!,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"We've walked by this place multiple times, it looks like a genuinely cozy hole in the wall type place that you would rave to your friends about but that won't be my case.

I know this is Edmonton, so I wasn't expecting tapas from Spain but these are the things I was expecting-water glasses filled at least once per hour (I never got a glass after asking for one, and the rest of the table went dry as well after the wine and salty dishes), cutlery would be nice. When you bring a plate to someone and there is no cutlery recognizing first is a plus but even being attentive enough to bring it when it is asked for is acceptable as well. 

There were two cooks for a room holding about 30 people. It shouldn't take that long to make a cold seafood dish. We did make reservations and although the service was very poor it was poor with a smile on their face, so I honestly feel bad and think they can't do any better

Someone might enjoy this place better if it was emptier-the cooking and service would be expected to be better. My suggestion would be to go for the wine and some snack size appies that range from 14-24 dollars, and then walk down to the blue plate diner for a meal that is half the price, excellent service and has that cozy feeling-just in a larger area.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Gnocchi with braised beef brisket is definitely the highlight of our entire meal. Next level.
Mushroom tart was also very tasty and a nice change from the other proteins. I'd say the menu is more geared towards meat eaters - not too many veggie options to either only have or have as sides to the meat options. I'd skip the chorizo shrimp grits; I was excited for this but was disappointed.

It's quite expensive. This is a place to go for an occasion and not a regular date night/ girls night spot.

For two people we ordered a total of 5 meals and we decided to opt out of dessert.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"My friend and I popped in for a late night finisher after enjoying our main meal at a place a few doors down.

It was packed inside the small space, so we ended up on the pop up patio.  We ordered the Bacon, a piece of pork belly on crostini with apple mayonaise and maple apple balsamic, and holy heck was it delicious. 
For dessert we had a (I think bourbon) chocolate tart with salted caramel sauce, it was, possibly one of the best desserts I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. So good in fact, that we ordered a second. 
The only reason this place isn't a 5 star is the wine and beer list.  I don't understand why restaurants don't put more effort into the beer list, there are loads of Alberta breweries, and this place does not carry a single one, nor do they carry good quality beer.   It's time to support local, and bring in quality beer, especially when the food is as good as it is. Kronenbourg 1664 and similar types do not cut it. 
Wine list was not really that interesting, same wines you can find at most other restaurants....

Food = 5.5/5
Service 4.5/5
Beer list 1.5/5
Wine list 3/5

14.5/20",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Visited this place during my brief visit in Edmonton and it was absolutely amazing. I honestly can't tell you prices or what a menu looks like because I never saw it. :-)

We were taken here for a company event, very intimate and cozy setting. There were maybe 10-12 courses of different nibbles coming out and by the end I was full but could not resist the options. 

The wine was incredible and the service was superb. Probably one of the best services at a dining place I've ever experienced.

Kelsey was our server and she was absolutely amazing. If I ever get a chance to visit Edmonton again, this the first place on my list. Not sure why didn't think to come on here and write a review but I did email the company to thank them for such wonderful service.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Visited this place on a Saturday night with resos on a recommendation from a dear friend; thank you D because Tzin was amazing!

Parking is a bit tricky as is most downtown parking but found street parking a few blocks down and walked to the restaurant. The restaurant is quite small; perhaps the smallest I've ever seen, especially if you don't include the few tables in the patio. Dark with a homey ambiance inside, I think some people may find the space a bit underwhelming and cramped at first glance, but once you're seated at your table, you honestly don't even notice! I am a big fan of small intimate dinners with my company anyway, so I loved this and being able to carry out a conversation without yelling over other people and/or loud music. I recommend making reservations (open table) as space is very limited. 

They have a pretty good variety in the wine menu - we had the champagne (thank you J) and I ordered a 6oz of the gewurztraminer which I really really enjoyed - it was light and fruity and very easy to drink! 

I was recommended to try the bacon and apple compote dish here, so we went with the feed me menu and mentioned we'd like the bacon included. Our server asked us if there were anything we didn't like, and away he went to put together something for us. 

Started off with the cod which was cooked perfectly. Then the mushroom tart, followed by the duck sausage. We got the bacon and apple compote dish last, but was still feeling like we could eat a bit more, so we requested one more dish and they brought out the boar meatballs which were the perfect size to tip us from ok to full. 

As for dessert, we got the flourless chocolate cake (thank you J, again) which was a real treat - melt in your mouth goodness! 

I didn't spend much time explaining each dish in this review because just thinking about them makes me hungry again and it's a far visit for me (I'm not local to Edmonton) so it makes me sad but I can tell you that every dish was well balanced and perfect in it's own way. I really recommend this place for anyone looking to dine for good food, good drinks, at an intimate atmosphere. Would say it's perfect for a special date (anniversary, birthday, etc.) and you will guaranteed to leave full and happy.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Simply amazing. Small, intimate and personal. Tried the 'Feed Me' option and it did not disappoint. Every plate was sublimely prepared and the service was top rate. A must when you desire a smart setting and sophisticated meal that is served by caring professionals who care about their craft.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"It pains me to write this review since the previous dozen or so times I'my boyfriend and I have been to Tzin for date nights, it was always enjoyable, cozy and the servers really made us feel special, however, this past weekend, my boyfriend and I had our least favourite dining experience there and that really made us both question if we want to return in the near future. 

It's true when they say customer service either makes or breaks an experience. When we first started going to Tzin about two years ago, we were blessed with two excellent servers - Kerrie & Mel... they alone made us want to come back because they made us laugh and were so enthusiastic about the experience and the food. However, about a year ago, Mel left to pursue other endeavours, but we were left in the capable hands of Kerrie (who is also the owner). She has always been friendly, sweet and super pleasant. Re-hired was a former male server from the past. The last few times we've dined there we luckily had Kerrie has our server so my boyfriend and I were happy about that. However, this past Saturday, upon arrival, we were surprised to see that Kerrie was not there, and instead, there was the regular male server from previous times plus another gentleman serving the room. We were greeted promptly and asked if we had reservations (which we did). There were two free tables, for two, at the time - one right near the entrance, and the other in the middle of the room. He immediately pointed to the table right near the entrance for us to sit. We obviously preferred to sit closer inside since it was -30 outside and there isn't much of a barrier between the outside door and inside. I therefore had to ask if we could sit at the other table instead. Instead of agreeing to it, we had to wait until the server asked the other gentleman for permission (which I thought weird since they were both tables for 2). Anyways, that's fine. We got our table in the middle and were seated promptly but missing a menu until my boyfriend had to ask for me. It's around this point that I really started feeling like this date night wasn't going to be the same as others and my boyfriend said he was just thinking the same thing. The server wasn't warm and genuine in his greeting, didn't even ask how we were doing, just wanted to see if we were ready to make our order. Throughout the night, I noticed the same lack of personal attentiveness - for instance, in the past with the girls, usually when the dish is placed on the table, it is described in delicious detail - this time nothing was described except for the three different sauces accompanying the chorizo. Also, our server never once checked up on us after the first few bites, to see how our food was. Incidentally, we ordered three of our favourite dishes and they are all usually very good, but this time round, the potato bravas was seriously lacking in depth - a certain smokiness that we've tasted in the past was not there and all the flavours felt disconjointed like they didn't have time to meld together. The bacon and the chorizo we ordered were very good. All-in-all, my boyfriend and I commented on how cold and inpersonal it felt, even though the space is small and warm. We actually finished our food and drink, didn't linger to have dessert like usual, because that's how disappointed we were with the night's experience. In fact, our date lasted a grand total of 1 hour from start to finish. So much for a lovely evening out.

Please note, the price for food here is a steep, albeit good, compared to the portion sizes. For instance, we ordered the ""potato bravas"" which was $14.50 for literally two small handfuls of chopped potatoes with bits of bacon, covered in a tomato sauce and topped with green onion. The ""bacon"" dish  was $16 for 3 bite-size pieces of pork belly on crostini. And the ""grilled chorizo sausage"" was $15 for maybe a 20 cm long piece of sausage.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Wow! I can't say enough about this quaint and incredibly charming gem in the heart of downtown!! We came to celebrate a friends 30th birthday and the whole experience start to finish was wonderful. As a table we chose the ""feed me"" option where you close the menus and allow the chefs to choose for you throughout the night. Each dish was impressive- full of flavour and variation. Not only was the food standout but the service was fantastic. They take care of you as if you are in their home. They were attentive and truly passionate about the experience they offer. The ambiance of the room
is warm and intimate. I will absolutely be returning and recommending it to everyone.  Thanks for the great night Tzin!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Top 5 in Edmonton. 

Owners are very personable. Very intimate space. Great wine selection. They put a reasonable effort into changing their dishes. Love their home made sausages that seem to be different every time I eat here. The staff will actually converse with you and the atmosphere is amazing. 5/5",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This place is amazing!  I have been here twice now.  Once with my boyfriend for a date night, the atmosphere was perfect.  Staff was very friendly, and though our table was right beside the dishwasher (we did get a couple little splashes, in which we laughed off) it was an amazing time.  Second time I took my mother for a mother/daughter lunch.  Bother times we did the ""feed me"" option.  Both times got the bacon.  That dang dish is amazing!  Dreams are made from that dish. My mother/daughter day was just as enjoyable. I recommend this place to everyone.  I love the food is so fresh and typically locally sourced.  You can taste the quality, care and pride that is served to you on your plate.  A little on the pricey side, but that is why it is a treat for us to go, and the price is totally worth it.  Try it and tell me I am wrong :)",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"fantastic service and we enjoyed the dinner very much. really liked the pork belly, but other than that it's just alright. it's a very small restaurant so make sure you make reservation before coming.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Tonight was our first visit. From the time we entered at 8:45pm till the time we left 12:15am we did not stop smiling and having an absolutely amazing experience. I told Glen (Owner) that I was going to tell all the ""sarcastic"" things he said to me but even now I cannot...  It is a must visit place. Melissa is fabulous. My honey and I tried numerous dishes and even more new wines, ports, liquers, and scotches... Glen never steered me wrong... well maybe the Malbec :-)
Chef has an amazing ability to combine flavours and textures to tantalize the palate!
We will definitely return on our next trip from the Mac!  Looking forward to meeting Kelsey!!
A must for everyone!!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"It isn't often you walk off the street and find a place that fits perfectly to what you were looking for. Following the game we were looking for a wine bar to enjoy a glass of wine and an appetizer. The reviews were good so we made our way here. 
This place does not disappoint and Glenn has it figured out. Great service, great wine and great food. 
We had the chorizo sausage and a few glasses of an amazing Tempranillo wine. The food was amazing but what was better was the atmosphere of the place, like having dinner with friends in the kitchen. 
This place is great for sharing with fantastic tapas and an awesome wine selection. Most of all there is Glenn, he will make you feel at home right in his kitchen.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Small, cute, cozy, great wine. What more do you want?",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I went here on Saturday and had a glass of wine. My boyfriend ordered a Stella but the owner brought him out the same glass of wine as me, (we think it was due to the music being too loud) it was really hard to have a conversation due to the overpowering music and the fact that your 3 feet away from everyone else, and have to compete over their voices as well. 

It was very tiny, basically the size of a 4 stall washroom... 
There is no room to move around, but the interior is nicely painted in a deep red and there's modern black furniture.. 
I don't think I would go here ever again due to the fact that 2 glasses of wine (one my bf didn't even order) came to $40.00 and it was just to tiny for my taste! -",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Amazing place. Great food! the Kitchen works magic and the wine pairing and all the ambiance just adds up to ""You gotta go there if you are in Edmonton!!!"" We are Southern California foodies...so this was just an amazing experience of fun, food and great wine choices......We were here for the Women's Baseball World Cup. We ate there 4 times....someone said in the reviews that this was a homey place..upscale homey but warm and inviting and everyone there makes you feel welcomed and cared for!!!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Fantastic find! i am from california and always look for a small local place with good food, large wine list and a friendly atmospere  TZin fits the bill! The owner is recommended tasty wine pairings and the chef (cory) served me his creations  tried the Brie, the tomtato sald and the chorizo  All fantastic!   you cant go wrong  enjoy!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I have mixed feelings about this place.  The seating was cramped for a table of four. The food, however, was awesome! The sommelier and waitress were very friendly, but the one thing that annoyed me is our sommelier  asked me what type of wine I liked, when I told him ""white"" and ""sweet"""" he just went and grabbed me a glass that he picked without consulting me, or what my budget was. The wine was good, but it was a bit of a shock to see that he had picked a $14 glass of wine for me, which was more than I intended to pay. I really did enjoy the food though.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I stopped in here to meet some friend's. I had never heard of it before and had no idea what to expect. It was a very nice looking place, very fancy on the inside and they had a very cool wine bar at the back. 

I actually never tried anything here because I only came to meet friend's and we were leaving right away. I would love to go back and give it a try though.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"We recently visited Tzin for a quick bite before a show at the Citadel.

We instantly regretted having places to go and not being able to linger over everything....and clearly so was everyone else. Despite having a reservation we had to sit at the bar because the place was tiny and 2 or 3 groups were lingering over their bill. Glen immediately made amends with a glass of wine on the house, and seemed excessively generous regarding tastes and samples throughout the evening.

We surrendered to his advice surrounding food and wine to go with the paella I was stuck on trying, and everything worked out amazingly well. The food was all well above expectations, and not in that way you kind of have to squint with Edmonton restaurants were you can see they are trying oh so hard but its just a bit off .... it was just simply fantastic!

Certainly going back soon.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"The owners make this place. You tell them to take care of you and they will.  They will pick out the Vino and the food will make your taste buds stand at attention. Sexy and Artistic feel that can ""seal the deal"" on a hot date.  Uber it home.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Mind blown

I had heard the Tzin was a great place for supper, my lord they couldn't be more right. It's an incredibly intimate space on 104st, maybe 16-18 seats total, and once you're inside you are transported to a whole new place. Dim and cozy, great art, tight seating and a wonderful friendly wait staff there to get you settled in quickly.

It's a pretty small menu consisting of mouthwatering tapas options. The wine list is one of the best Spanish ones I've ever seen. Lots of other worldly wines also but who we kidding Spanish wine and tapa's are great together. Order up cocktails and a bottle of tempernillo and away we go

I started with a grilled flat iron steak with a salted caramel gravy of some kind and grilled zebra tomatoes. It's a strange combination in theory but it was fantastic! The richness of the perfectly cooked steak contrasted with the mildly sweet sauce was a revelation. Perfect. My Gf had a salad with all kinds of veggies, croutons, harissa dressing...wasn't my thing but she loved it. Second I had what's just referred to on the menu as ""The Bacon"" Basically a piece of side belly roasted, placed upon beautiful baked crostini with homemade apple mayonnaise topped with an apple compote...all on a bed on maple syrup reduction. Ya tastes as good as it sounds..I can't even begin to love that dish enough. The GF had ""The Mushrooms"" she was in heaven. Just a whole bunch of fungi with gnocchi and Parmesan cream...again not my bag but she couldn't get enough. Finished off with both desserts, cause why not right, and both were amazing. A flourless chocolate cake and a lemon meringue tart...paired up with some white desert wine (which they bought for us) and a glass of port...pretty much our own little slice of heaven. 

The service was just impeccable front to back, from giving us a good description of how the menu was meant to be enjoyed to a little after dinner drink with dessert. I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. Great job and thank you for an awesome memorable night. 

Cheers

Andy",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Great little hole in a wall place. It's literally a long corridor, plus some seating area outside during summer.
Great paella, iron steak was tender but quite good on taste. Desserts was just ok (cashew butter panna cotta, apple cider curd).
If you like alcohol they have great selections.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
Excellent service and amazing food. It is the best restaurant in Edmonton. Hands down.,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Excellent little place on 104 Street, great selection of wines, and equally uniquely different small plate food options to share with a twist.  Will definitely return in future.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Wow what at beautiful wine bar. The artwork is definitely frames this little restaurant. 
Elegant and carefully selected decor that speaks the personality of the owner. 
The atmosphere is perfect for a  romantic date especially for two extremely in love people.
Because there's only a few tables, you need to make reservations in advance.
They're not open on Sundays & Monday.
We were warmly greeted by a beautiful lady. She was very personable, caring and was passionate about the menu. I assume she's the owner.
I'm not a wine drinker, but my friend had a nice glass of white wine and fell in love with how sweet it tasted. I had a coffee and it was exquisite.
I love this tiny room  and I would like to discover more of it's majestic presence. I need to finish this review another time when I try there food here!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
Went here for a office Christmas Party. What a great place for a intimate gathering of 20 people. Food didn't stop arriving at our table! Amazing service from the all the staff. Oh and check out the bathroom!,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Sorry for the tardiness in the next series of my reviews.  With the New Year having come and gone, work has put a dent in my writing time, however, not in my dining time :-9

On January 6th of this new year, I ventured out to Tzin with my companion.  I haven't been back there in MANY months and had also heard that they had changed up the menu and staff a bit.

As per its usual, most know that it is a VERY small, narrow place.  In fact, it was very much confirmed by how the waitress had place herself in between the tables (my companion had a nice view of ....) to take care of people.  She was not deterred as she was very personable, however, don't go here for a ""romantic"" evening, nor if you value ""personal"" space in ALL directions.

Having not been there in a while and noting that the menu had changed, the manager of the place came to our table and asked if we would like to have him decide what to serve us to be able to sample a fair amount to share.  We said yes and  we had quite a selection of  small dishes.....  We shared the Mushroom and Spinach tart which was quite good and not soggy (sometimes they can get that way if the spinach isn't dried out enough).  Next was the Baked Brie which was also quite nice.  Next to come up was the Stuffed Olives.  They are stuffed and deep fried and served with an aioli sauce (and the beginning of aioli for the rest of our meal).  The olives are the salty Manzanita olives (which are already pretty salty) so our question to each other was, ""why add more salt?""  Unless someone back there didn't realize it.  The Crab Stuffed Prawns were good, however, could have done without the aioli sauce since the flavour was more than GOOD without it....alas, there it was.  We were also served the Potato Bravas which were quite good and very tasty :-]  and to finish off, we had the Charcuterie and Cheese plate (why is it that NO ONE ever serves enough bread to go with it?).  All quite good, however, not ""amazing""....we ordered a bottle of the Cristalino Cava for the meal and had enough of it left for our dessert (a chocolate ganache cake which was highly recommended).  What happened next is what was a bit perplexing....as we waited for the dessert the manager came back by to ask if we would like some very nice port that they have....not telling us the label or showing us the wine menu for it, I (VERY stupidly) assumed it was going to be a simple taste on the house, considering we let him pick the items on the menu, our wine selection was what it was and he casually suggested such a thing....nope, didn't happen--it was on the bill and if I had known how much it was, I would have simply said ""no thank you"" as my sparkling wine was quite nice and I enjoyed it a lot.
So, note to self when/if I return to Tzin:  If someone offers a drink make sure you know WHO is paying for it....
All in all, I would recommend the place as it does have quite a nice meal selection (I would like to go back and try the paella and the manager actually did tell us that if we do want it, to let them know when we call for the reservation so that it can be prepared timely) and a nice ""vibe""....but like I said, make sure you don't have ""space issues"" and are okay with being ""cozy"" in all directions (unless of course you sit at the raised tables [there are two, I think] along the wall).",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"I was here for Edmonton Dining Week. Out of the 6 different restaurants, this one was the one that we were least impressed by....not because of the flavour of the food, but the size of portions. I also felt that our server was really great to us when we were ordering, but then once we were done so was he. I really dislike this...especially because we ordered a lot. And it cost a lot. Our server gave us the option of having two Edmonton Dining meals, or one Dining meal, and one chef's creation. The Chef's creation was 15 dollars more, which we weren't told about, and we were unsure what was included. We ordered two cocktails at 8 bucks each. My Gin and tonic was fine, but it was probably the worse Caesar that my husband has had for along time. And at a tapas bar, this is disappointing. Onto the dishes - 
Tuna Tartare - cilantro, shallots, citrus, grilled lemon vinaigrette, 
Bacon Maple Balsamic Apple Compote, Apple Mayonnaise, Crostini, Calvados Gastrique
Wild Boar Meatballs - Tomato & Black Garlic, Jack Daniels Glaze
Seared Scallops - pickled tomatoes, balsamic
Bison & Mushroom Sausage - wild blueberries, root vegetable puree, shoestring potatoes
and a Wild Mushroom Gnocchi
So in general, all the dishes were amazing! I loved the tuna tartare, my husband liked the bacon dish. What we had an issue with was the portion size...which is tiny. And what really made my husband angry was for the bison and mushroom sausage...there was really no side dish to speak of. Look at the photos. If you have a tiny portion on tuna tartare, 
a tiny portion of seared scallops, you would expect that your 1 sausage would either come with 2 sausages or 1 sausage with two sides that would fill you. We weren't filled. In fact, we grabbed an order of fries to fill up before we went home. 
Super disappointing.
We won't be back .",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. Tzin sets a completely new standard for dining in Edmonton, and if this had been the first restaurant I'd ever visited, all my Yelp reviews would be down one star -- Tzin just sets the bar too high. I went here as part of Downtown Dining Week and it was my first time visiting, despite having walked by the place for years with good intentions to try it. I've always found it difficult to get a reservation, and once I got inside, I realized why: this place is tiny. And I mean TINY! Small in the way that makes Corso 32 look big! It's practically a closet, so be ready to rub elbows with your neighbors. On the upside, you can get a good peek at what they ordered ;) Service was phenomenal. All the staff was engaging and friendly. It almost seems more appropriate to describe them as hosts, because visiting Tzin did feel like going to a dinner party at a friend's home. The food was so good my best friend and I were practically in tears as we ate. We actually would have stayed there all evening and ordered dish after dish with wine after wine, but Tzin has a two-hour dining limit. I imagine patrons refusing to leave is a common occurrence. I am wholly obsessed. Tzin, I am yours forever.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
My boyfriend and I spent New Years Eve at Tzin and it was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The restaurant is small but cozy with the addition of pillows on the booth side of the tables. We were both a little apprehensive about the dinner going into it because the pre-set dinner for New Year's Eve was a little pricey ($140/person for 5 smaller courses and a bottle of wine) but it was worth every penny! The food is out of this world. I'm actually disappointed that it took us this long to eat there. We will for sure be back!,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"This is an adorable little 22 seat restaurant on 104th street! LOVE! The boyfriend and I made a reservation for this place (you need a reservation) and wandered in only a month after coming back from New York. To our surprise this place looked like it was in New York, which is what made me fall so madly in love with it. Edmonton doenst' have enough small restaurants that serve tapas and wine. I love that in these small restaurants you can see the chef preparing your food, I think it's always neat to watch. 

The lady that greeted us at the door was fantastic and clearly very passionate about this restaurant. The wine we chose was fantastic, and they told us they had a policy that if you aren't satisfied with your wine they will find a wine you like. 

The food we ordered was delicious, the brie was warm and goeey, the scallops were huge and seared to perfection and the steak dish we had made your mouth water. I'm getting hungry just thinking about how fantastic our meal was. 

I love the atmosphere of this place it's so cozy and romantic, I could sit in here and sip wine all day long... who knows maybe once the patio is opened I will! I'm nervous to post this review because I don't want people to know how amazing this place is least it turn into corso 32 and require reservations 2 months in advance! 

Tzin, everything about you is wonderful, I'll be back!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Excellent place in downtown Edmonton but be prepared to be pay a little higher than average prices for Edmonton food.  The service and food though is worth totally worth this quaint little find on 104 Street.  The selection of food, while small is done to perfection.  I loved the idea that you can tell them your food restrictions and how hungry you were and they would be willing to make up a selection of food for you.  The waiter (Glen) helped us chose an amazing wine to go with our food.  It's certainly not somewhere to go on a whim but when you are looking for a special night out, this tiny tapas bar will certainly fit the bill.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
So myself and a friend tried Tzin as she had gift card.   The portion size of the patatas braves was laughable. It was no more than half of a potato and looked to be deep fried cubes that you could find at the likes of Dennys.  $14.50 We also ordered the Islandic cod and the portion size was suggested to be for sharing but was actually the size of a plum at best. $24.50  When the server/owner would present us with the food she would go on about the magic the chef performed creating these meals. Including a bottle of mediocre wine we left about $140.00 poorer and hungry.  Never again!!,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Wow!  Very disappointed!   With all the hype I expected extraordinary not below average.

The food presentation was good.  But you don't eat the presentation.   I judge a place on how comparable is it to something I can make myself.  If it's not better than something I can whip up at home.  The place is not worth my time or money.

We tried the chorizo sausage.   It was overcooked and the skin was stuck to the meat.  Tasted better from my local grocer.

The Quinoa Salad... was okay.   The pickles everything was too much for me.

The duck was okay.  But compared to other restaurants that I've tried duck was average at best. 

Decided to skip dessert,  and head across the street for a dessert cocktail instead.",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
We arrived early for our reservation but were seated promptly. With only one waitress we found the service slow but efficient.  We ordered numerous appetizers and we  were very satisfied with the flavor although the portions were small for the price.  We had the paella for two and again found the portion to be quite small.  The flavor of everything was excellent but they were slow coming and overpriced for what you got.,2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Went there for my birthday... Great service, great food and an overall great time! Never thought you could have delicious prawns in the prairies!",2fTfpN5SggLgW4LlzptMPg
"Great kabsa and mandi; we drive around 45 minutes to get to this place. Portions are excellent for the price. The guys don't speak fluent English, but are generally nice. Seems like they're always out of chicken kabsa and/or mandi. Tried calling around noon for chicken kabsa or mandi and they'd be out already. You'd think they would make more considering they sell out fast, but feedback is not generally not even understood, so that's a waste.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
I like the new location. The food is great the dish size is satisfying. The staff is very welcoming and the hospitality at this place is great. I've been in the last location couple times and this one as well the food taste great plus you can order for party or feast you won't be disappointed. I recommend this restaurant if you are a fan of the middle eastern cousins.,3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Decided to stop by the new location on my way home from work and was happy I did despite the first review.

I had the mendi chicken which featured the same huge Kabsa portions I remembered - 1/4 chicken plus a mountain of rice for $12 means leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I liked the soup and I loved the side sauces over my rice. Nothing was burnt and everything was flavourful.

Can't wait to go back for the lamb as that was my favourite when they were downtown.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Reasonable prices, donair portions were very large and reasonable, and the owner was really friendly. I will be visiting again.

They also have a small assortment of Middle Eastern soda I would recommend.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"They are closed on Mondays
Amazing Mandy and Hanith
The place needs some renovation 
Need to improve the table service",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
I enjoyed the chicken Shawarma. They were generous with their chicken. It has a nice flavor and seasoning.  The mushroom soup wasn't to my like. Had a different flavor I just cant identify. The gravy on the poutine was pretty good and there was a decent amount of cheese on it. La Shish down the street is a bit better in my opinion. Prices are standard for Lebanese to go. You can eat for under $10.,3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"I went there looking for a great donair poutine and had a hard time finding parking. once that was solved go in and just saw the top banner with meal deals but not full menu in sight. I knew what I wanted and asked if they had it. poutine donair. was served hot but had it for take out so no salt and vinegar for the fries and white sauce was on the donair meat. was good healthily potion, but taste wise was not out standing but ok. if near there would go again and try something else. service was fast and efficient and they cater to the bar after crowds. was small clean place. I think they will do well in their location.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"We went there couple of times. Love the food, but in they don't have all what is says on the menu. Last three times wanted to order beef kebab, but they didn't have it. Lamb is great.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
I am so happy I found this place. This is the first time I went to a restaurant that served real Arabic food similar to what you can find in some Arabic countries. Most other restaurant only serve kebabs but here you can find delicious rice dishes such as Mandi and Kabsa. I ordered lamb Kabsa which was accompanied by soup and salad. The portion was huge and one was absolutely enough for two people. Lots of delicious meat. Loved it and will take my friends to eat here with me. I also liked that they had Arabic music playing. Overall a good experience.,3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
I have been ordering from them for over a year and have to say their food is absolutely delicious. Too bad they moved away form Whyte avenue!,3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"I ended up here on the spur of the moment for a quick supper last week with a friend. I used to go to a restaurant by the same name on Jasper Avenue that served Middle Eastern rice dishes - I am not sure if this is the same one, but the menu certainly looked familiar. However, instead of a rice dish, we had donairs, and they were spectacular: lots of flavourful meat, a good sauce, fresh veggies - it was packed with meat and the meat tasted different than the typical pressed meat that is used by commercial donair places. Prices are very reasonable. I am definitely coming back.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"a great Kabsa and Mandi , love it , nice service .
the place can use some renovation",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"I love this place, I come here all the time because it's close to my work. I always get the chicken mendi. Chicken is usually juicy, hot, and so tender that it's falling off the bone. Service has aways been super fast and friendly. Rice is super flavourful. Everything tastes fresh. Big portion sizes and inexpensive. Can't recommend enough!",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Great location, friendly welcoming staff but falls down with odd soup, oily salad, and the lamb special prepared much earlier in the day. I have not yet had --until today--either a pita or naan bread that was so burnt and dried out that it was not chewable.

Another Middle Eastern restaurant just opened its doors-Kabsa I have been in before just for a juice, seen what looks like some tasty and interesting foods.

I have been told that the King Fish Steak is halibut-so I planned to try it today. I was told  they moved from downtown 2 months ago to whyte ave and ran the same name restaurant for 11 years before ending up here.

 I came in today to try the King Fish Steak and was told they didn't have any?, They did say each day they have a special, so I ordered that. It was a lamb dish, with soup and rice.

Not 5 minutes later a large order of rice and lamb appear, with a partally charred pita bread, I  don't think it was Naan bread,  I first think I wont be able to finish it all. Very large portions adorn the disposable plate. I try the soup and cant figure out the taste, large carrots and peppers and potatoes, but little taste, there are mushy parts at the bottom-not sure what it was so I skip it altogether.

I start with the lamb that has been simmered so it falls of the bone, I like the portions but have had better lamb at other buffet tables elsewhere in the city.

The heaping mound of rice, are mixed with seasonings, they  also provide 2 small side containers of a clear hot chili pepper mix, and a cream dip-maybe its yogurt- I don't know.  I also skip the dips-try them but they don't help with the meal. The blackened crispy pita/naan is hard to chew-over crispy and does not really go with anything-its not stale but it is dried out, and burnt so it is discarded.

The salad which is some lettuce, tomatoes, and red peppers and white onion are drizzled with a lot of oil, it lost its crispy freshness and reminds me of a greek salad-minus the olives and feta cheese. Nothing really stands out in taste or flavor. I think the daily special was prepared much earlier in the day. 

I came around supper hour, so I think its should be their freshest dish to offer, they even suggested it  but I leave disappointed.  Wow do they pile up on the rice!

I get the rice to go, leave the soup, salad  but can't get seem to get that lamb and spice smells to stay at the restaurant.

 It reminded me sort of like mall food-the ready to go kind. The lamb special costs 15.00, so after 2 months here they may have to iron out some food quality and taste improvements. 

 I wish them well, the staff were very nice-maybe it was an off day.  I'm kinda glad I didn't get to try the fish dish after all. Some people came in checked out the foods and left, so hopefully its still in the developing stages, 

I am told  that in 2006 or 2007 they were named as one of the best visited middle eastern food places to eat in Edmonton. I will look forward  to those days again!",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"I checked this place out on Yelp and loved it. The menu has changed and has been simplified. The gentleman at the desk recommended the Lamb Mendi and it was delicious. The lamb was plentiful and falling off the bones. The rice was so good and I have never had rice like that before, great flavors. It also came with soup and salad. Not cheap but was so worth it.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Kabsa is easily the best kabab-house in Edmonton! I have been to many of them in YEG, and have found not only do they serve easily the most flavourful food, but they also include extremely generous proportions. My fianc√© and I typically share one order of chicken kabab as there is plenty of food for us.
Their rice really stands out, which is so crucial when it is the base of this genre of cuisine. It has so much zest! 
The meals include delicious humus, and kebab-shop sauce (white garlic sauce). Further they have an unreal delicious salad included, which is particularly appreciated considering most shops put little to no effort into an included salad due to it not being the main dish. The attention to detail from the team at Kabsa is fabulous. 
Could not be happier having found my new summer-time staple!",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"What can you say? The food is authentic, delicious, and filling?  All true.   The lamb is some of the best in the city.   The chicken mendi is all that is good about a chicken dish.   Rice is perfect.  

Try it all.  I have and you will enjoy it.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Great food , very tasty , Service is sometimes slow but over all clean place , halal food . Highly recommended",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"The lamb was tender and flavorful, the chicken was tender but not any different than a good roast from Safeway. Better than expected for a tiny Whyte avenue sandwich place.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"I ordered from Kabsa for the first time today through Skip and I am so impressed with the food! My first clue this was going to be good came when I looked at the menu and many of the items were sold out. I ordered the Lamb Mendi and it was so, so good, I almost cried. It may sound melodramatic but I have had so many disappointments when ordering out that when I tasted this succulent lamb - that was perfectly spiced without being spicy (hot sauce provided on the side if you do want it spiced) - and served with a perfect, fragrant rice, I was totally elated. Best lamb I have had in a long time... but wait, there's more! My dish was copious for the price (plenty of food for two meals!) and came with a delicate lentil soup and a crisp, fresh salad, each of which were also wonderfully spiced, each in their own way. This chef knows their spices and I for one will continue enjoying the delights they conjure up in their ""ultimate"" kitchen!",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"This place is excellent! I can't praise it enough  I've had chicken mendi from here multiple times,  always exceptional. It is a lot of food, and every thing is very flavourful: the two sauces, lentil soup, rice and chicken. 

I also tried their chicken shawarma today. Best shawarma I have had in edmonton, hands down.  Unlike other places, the chicken it self is cooked in delicious spices and it's extremely juicy and not at all dry.  Other places always have dry, relatively tasteless chicken.  Not this place!

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates good, hearty food.  And be sure to come hungry :)",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Just ok. 
I am disappointed because kebabs were smelly. Not marinated and well cooked, I could smell the smell of raw beef. 
Walking out hungry after paying $20. Dissatisfied.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Went to Kabsa for the first time tonight.  I had the Lamb Kabsa and it was absolutely delicious.  The lamb was cooked to perfection, very tender.  It came with rice and a soup to die for.  This will become my go to place for nights I don't want to cook at home!",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
Taste is okay. If you've had Mandi in the middle east you would know this is not the greatest. Problem is I've had it maybe 3 times and I'd have a stomach ace as soon as im done with my food each time!,3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"The food here is decent, even if it is 30% or so more expensive than it should be.  I suppose those Whyte Avenue rents must put some awful pressure on the bottom line.  Check out Kabsa if you can snag a Groupon deal.",3gTZAOmML02T1L5gYIHYqQ
"Went here last December to buy a Tiramisu cake for my wife's birthday. It was so good, my wife loved it, you guys have set the bar high. The mascarpone cheese was extra creamy and smooth. The dark chocolate shavings add a little bittersweet taste as well. 

Food is good, a bit on the pricier side though but once in a while wouldn't hurt.
Parking is not difficult at all.
I've recommended this place to my friends and they liked it here too.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I love shopping local and the Italian Centre makes it so much fun.  They are chock-full of products that I just can't seem to find at my local chain grocery store and the aisles are always bursting with bright colours against the bright white shelves.  I love going to the freezer section to pick up my favourite Pinnochio ice cream, some fancy cheeses, an olive tray and then strolling the bakery section to see what delights call my name...

I love to cook so it is wonderful to have a place so close to home where I can pick up upscale or imported ingredients and for very reasonable prices.  Fig jams, san marzano tomatoes, any and all kinds of pasta, artisanal sodas, any kind of cheese you can imagine. I've never left the store feeling disappointed or like I have forgotten something.

This shop was much needed on the west side of the city and I am so pleased that I am able to shop here much more frequently now because it is so close to me. Happy happy happy.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Super fresh & new! Awesome bakery has so many tasty treats, from cakes, cookies, cream filled pastries, breads and other yummy goods. Cool little seating area so you can have a treat and coffee to fuel up before shopping, or relax and chat. The dry goods selections are so varied, that if you want a fancy pasta, sauce, jam, pickled something or spices chances are you'll find it here.

The Deli section is loaded with meats and cheese & antipasto and it's busy. Make sure you take a # right away, even if you're not quite sure what you want yet. They will cut a small sample if you want to taste something before buying, and on our trip, they pulled out & prepped a fresh leg of prosciutto for us, so we could have our little portion sliced off. It took a lot of effort on their part to get it ready, but they were super nice and friendly the whole time and talked us through a few other options for our antipasto dinner feast.

Produce is a side note here really, the best bargain is in the fresh basil. Checkouts are plentiful and speedy, and the parking is roomy enough for trucks and cars to fit. Will certainly be back again for the deli selections alone!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I can't say enough nice things about the Spinelli family and the Italian Center.  

If you like Charcuterie, here is a great place to go and get all of the ingredients for your board.  They have a great selection of meats, cheeses and olives.  

I especially love visiting the Italian Center to make up gift baskets for friends and family.  They have a great selection of European brands that the big grocery stores don't carry. 

Italian Center also supports local producers.  They carry locally made gelato, perogies, pasta etc. 

The bakery is pretty amazing as well.  Very beautiful selections for special occasions.

The ""Spinelli's"" cafe that is attached to all of the locations is a great place to have a latte and a panini.  There are also panini wrapped and ready for you to take home.  Very difficult to find a place to sit on the weekend.  It is quite the popular place. 

They also have a small selection of kitchenware available.  If you like to make your espresso without the fancy machines, let Italian Center hook you up.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Love this place! The food, the atmosphere, the prices are all great!!! I will be returning like every week for all my bakery needs for sure. Check it out!!!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"A little taste of Italy and other parts of Europe!
You'll find brands of foods here that aren't as easily available at ordinary supermarkets.

$2.00 fresh pizza dough is a must buy! They freeze well and your pizzas will be amazing.

The deli is off the charts. You'll find all sorts of proscuitto, salami, mortadella, capocollo and more varying in spiciness and also hybrids! My favourite is the spicy salami proscuitto. 

Cheese for days! There's just a wack load of cheese to choose from and it's the best.

There's fresh treats also at the bakery with all the classic italian goodies to things like croissants and macaroons. 

Pasta! There's like three aisle of straight up pastas. Ain't nothing like loading up on carbs! Also a good place to find truffle oil. Yummmmm!

There isn't as much selection when it comes to produce but I'd go here for the specialty foods and go to superstore or Safeway for your produce.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Always a great place to spend time looking around. I love going here to build dinner on the fly. 

You'll also find some good meats like bison, and elk, and some different cuts you may not find elsewhere...Fresh baked breads and dough, and a whole array of desserts in the attached Cafe. 

If you haven't been, just go! You won't be disappointed.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Finding dinner on a Friday night will definitely be a challenge. Luckily we live by West Edmonton Mall and we do get some viable choices. We had a hankering for pizza but didn't want to wait in line at Famoso so we decided to take a stab at the Italian Centre's pizzeria.

The restaurant side is more like a lil charming caf√©. They have those plexi-glass domes that allows you to look, point and go OOOOH and AAAAH at the selection of baked goods. 2 for 1 chocolate croissants? HECK YES.

Go up to the till and order our pizzas. They were all described in Italian and I must apologize as all my stomach wanted to do was eat rather than identify all the wonderful ingredients. We ordered a savory artichoke themed pizza and a spicy salami pizza as well. These pizza came out faster than an Italian stallion and it made us so much more happier that we could eat quicker than if we went to other pizzerias. Just like with Neopolitan pizzas, they were thin, crispy and not too terribly greasy. The spicy salami pizza definitely left a hot impression which was the perfect compliment on a cold Friday night. 

Both pizzas and two drinks came out to about $30 which isn't too bad for dinner on a Friday night.

TL;DR: Extremely fast and tasty pizza and a wonderful alternative to Famoso if you don't want to sit and wait.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I've done a review on another Italian Centre location but I thought the newest West location deserved one all on its own. I honestly feel like a kid in a candy shop when I walk in, it's almost overwhelming. It's no different than the other locations in the city, but just bigger and newer.  The deli section is a cheese and meat lover's dream, and I love that they always have samples for customers to try. I will admit though I am unused to the way they display their pricing. It can be so overwhelming with all the selection available, it's also nice that the staff encourages sampling before buying. I love the pasta aisle and looking at all the different types of types and shapes you wouldn't see at your typical Safeway or Sobeys. The bakery display of all the cakes and pastries is divine and I'm eagerly waiting for my next excuse to go out and buy a full size tiramisu cake. We like to buy the calamari from the freezer section. I also hear the prepared pizza dough is also good. The staff are quite friendly and appear like they genuinely enjoy working here. There is ample parking. Love, love, LOVE this store.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Excellent food in the cafe. Their pizza is almost as good as Tony's. Great thin crust, just the right amount of chew and no soggy spots. All the pizza needs is a little more zip in the tomato sauce. Good selection of top quality toppings.

This is a relaxing place to shop for speciality foods in a clean and friendly store. A little high price wise but so are all of these types of speciality places. At least here when you ask for Prosciutto you get the real thing.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Oh yay, Italian Centre on westend! Bakery has lots of choices to pick from including cakes in so many flavours including raspberry, strawberry, nutella, chocolate, mocha, and more! √âclairs, cream filled pastries, tiramisu, banana bread, and more than I can remember! So much to choose from and a great price of $2.25/piece or a dozen for less than $23! Great for times when you have visitors coming, or if you want desserts for dinner.  They have a great seating area and sandwiches and drinks too.  Fresh bread you can help yourself and bag too.

Deli section with meats and cheese was busy.  And they have a number system so great when lots of people waiting.  Too bad they didn't have this in the bakery as it was busy there too.  Produce section had some great prices but not as much variety as larger stores.

Most tills were open and no wait! Service was good.  There is parking by the entrance and north and south of the store but likely gets busy on the weekends.  Great place to meet a friend for dessert and coffee, or pick up some treats for home!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I always enjoy my excursions here. The staff are all very friendly and patient, especially in the deli where they offer suggestions, answer questions and are extremely liberal with their samples. I've discovered many different types of meats and cheeses through staff recommendations and have always happily handed over my money. The bakery workers are always nice as well, and their canolis are deeeeelicious!! 

Lastly, the cashiers are also super friendly and pleasant. Everyone I've met has appeared to enjoy what they do, and do so with a smile. I come for the service first, and the delicious treats are the cherry on top.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
Amazing array of Italian products. Proper Italian coffee and pastry counter. Great pizza! Some of the staff are very young and inexperienced but it seems that the more senior staff really bend over backwards to get them up to speed.,71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Fresh food!  Enjoyed the pizza and bakery items.  Very busy place , for obvious reasons!! Will visit again!!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I usually go to the southside location for the Italian Centre Shop, just because I spend more time on the southside, but the other day I was in the west end and decided to visit the newest branch of the Italian Centre Shop. 

This location is conveniently located by West Edmonton Mall (it's right by Spence Diamonds) so it's easy to find. It's not in West Ed however, which is great because I've gotten to really hate fighting the crowds in that mall). What was the point of this ramble, just that you'll be able to find the Italian Centre Shop easily. 

The building is new and it's pretty bright. The aisles are a bit small and shorter than a big grocery store. I don't know how it compared to the original location (I've never been), but with the southside it seems to be a bit bigger, but not by much. The deli counter is huge, lot's of delicious meats and cheeses to buy (and olives if you're into that sorta of thing). The bakery has delicious breads and pastries, like focaccia bread and cannoli. There's a small produce section, plus a variety of other food products, most from Italy, but also from other places in Europe.

I always love coming to the Italian Centre Shop. The prices can be a bit more than at a regular grocery store, but they carry brands and items I haven't found anywhere else in Edmonton. I don't speak/read/understand Italian or any other language aside from English (well maybe a little French). I've often gone into this store and just picked up something random to buy, without having any idea of what it is or if it's good. Maybe I'm just a nerd, but it's always a fun adventure heading to the Italian Centre Shop.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I love this place!!! Super huge variety of groceries that are hard to find. You can find burrada cheese here in the deli, which is a gem when it's impossible to find here in the city. 

They also have a bakery attachment with a various assortment of Italian baked goodies. They have cannoli's here!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"This market is a Mecca of Italian goodies & groceries! In the 6 or so months since it opened it has become my absolute favourite place to shop. The store itself is gorgeous; wall to wall white marble that gleams in the light that shines in from the large, floor to ceiling windows. The produce is always fresh, the dairy cases busting at the seems with the most delectable cheeses from around the word. The bakery is what I imagine heaven much be like - cannolis, florentines, shortbread, meringues, flans and the most amazing breads! And then there is the meat counter, or should I say counters, plural! I can't even put into words... just a place of sheer carnivorous delight! 

There is tons of parking available out front. A Spinelli's Cafe inside with killer cappuccinos. What else can I say but go, shop, and be in love with food again!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I love the Italian Centre. I've been coming to the Downtown location for years, and I think it's one of the most original, best all around places in Edmonton. They have top quality cheeses, deli, etc, and an amazing selection of unique items that are hard to find at your standard fare grocery chains. The new west end location is pretty much the same as the original. I'm really glad to see that they expanded after having just the one location for so long.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"This location is gorgeous, brightly lit and well organized.  They have a great selection of canned tomatoes, which I find sorely lacking in other stores. Trust me, quality San Marzano tomatoes can make a pasta sauce. We actually stopped in to peruse their selection of frozen, filled pastas, and we were not disappointed. We ended up getting a bag of veal tortellini, and I'm just waiting for the right sauce to come along so we can enjoy it properly.  The reason I took a star off is because the deli, while bursting with selection, needs a better ordering system. People seemed to be queued up haphazardly, and things seemed to be taking a long time, which is why we didn't get anything from the deli today (that, and deli meats are a no no when you're pregnant). Maybe implementing a number system would make things more efficient. We will, however, be back, as there are some things available here that you just can't get elsewhere.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Always a buzz of cultural delight. 

Whether you are shopping for pasta, pasta sauce, spices or just coming in for all the delicious baked goods. this one stop shop is a place to get educated and everything Italian and everything delicious!!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"The Italian center on the West end is our favourite place to get authentic Italian ingredients. They have an extensive deli area with meats, cheeses and olives. The majority of what they sell is imported directly from Italy and is of utmost quality. We come here for there natural flours for pizza and pasta making, as well as there huge selection of cheeses and a variety of beautiful cured meats. 
The only negative thing that I would say here is the espresso at Spinellis is not authentic. When I go to Italy I expect a legitimate barista to serve espresso not just a button to be pressed. But maybe that's just the coffee snob in me talking!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I can't believe there hasn't been a review about this place yet. 

My husband grew up going to the Italian Center by the Stadium, and I like that one for the history, but I like the west end one much, much more.

The restaurant section is open and we can usually find a seat there. The pizza is a must have! In fact, it is better than any other pizza we have ever had anywhere. In short, it is the best pizza in Edmonton and surrounding areas - hands down.

The staff are always friendly. Unlike the stadium one, I have never had a grumpy cashier or person behind the counter. They are helpful and knowledgeable. (Expect about the wine, but that's okay)

The grocery food is priced very well and you can get most of your shopping done at the Italian Center. You can't get toilet paper etc because it is a specialty store, but as far as food goes - they have everything. 

And, of course, they have the best selection of cheese and bread around. We even went there for a hard-to-find cheese and they had it!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Love it here!  Stopped to eat lunch. Had the crab corner chowder soup and focaccia sandwich with capicola spinach sandwich. Both fabulous. Yum. The cappuccino was amazing. Smooth and flavorful. 

After we ate we looked around and had many opportunities to purchase and delight in all the foods for sales a great place to shop for all you deli needs and desires and more. Bakery. Butcher. Etc etc.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Best Pizza I found in edmonton. Great staff such a nice experience. 
Makes me feel at home. 
Coming from a picky montreal foody ;)",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
Came here after dinner at Famoso after a recommendation by a friend! Hard to get a table (which is always a good sign) and authentic Italian locals were there. Amazing selection of desserts and the food looks great here too! Nothing really for the vegan in the prepared foods BUT so many pasta and vegetable dishes in the isles I could (and did) buy!! Coming back for sure. :),71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"I am totally stoked that an Italian Centre has finally opened up in the west end. It is great to have an independent choice for meats, produce, and general groceries. The coffee shop area is quite large and there are lots of delicious treats from which to choose, as the Italian Centre's signature panini sandwiches, pizza, and focaccia bread. I love the extensive pasta and chocolate aisles and the deli counter is something to behold. If you have been to the south side location, this one is modeled almost exactly after that one.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
Love love LOVE This place!! Especially the true Original Store.. in Little .. yummy food  friendly staff and the delicious deli is alway yummier,71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Good place to go for that special Italian ingredient.   We used to LOVE the pastries, but, they've gone downhill.   Last time we ordered a lemon slice and mocha slice.   No difference in the taste.   So sad.  They used to be fabulous.   Deli selections are still excellent.  The meat and cheese varieties are wonderful.   Vegetables are so so.   Not as fresh as they could be.  Prices are a little higher than Save-On-Foods",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"What is not to love about the Italian Center Shop?

I was soooo excited when they opened the West End location just over a year ago.  Now we can hop down the road without venturing all the way across the city for the best meats, cheese, and olives to die for!

The staff here are phenomenal and will give you all kinds of suggestions for parties you are hosting.  The deli is my favourite!  I rarely escape with less than $50 of meats, cheeses, and olives - YOU MUST TRY THE FETA & ALOMOND STUFFED OLIVE OR YOU HAVE NOT LIVED!

There are usually some fabulous Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar tasters set up and this is defintiely the place to come get your high quality oils!  The staff are quite knowledgeable and can help you pick the out the best varieties to meet your needs - and it's true, everyone needs a couple in the house (remember to store them in the dark!).

But seriously, this place is great whether you are looking for an Italian sweet treat or want to make the world's best charcuterie board for a night-in with your girlfriends.

And let's not forget, if you get way too hungry from looking at all of the goodies, you can grab a bite right in their cafe with some authentic Italian pizza and one of the best coffees around!

See you soon, Italian Center Shop!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Amazing atmosphere!  Great baked goods, will go back and check out more soon!
Cafe was so busy, you know it has to be good!

Anyway bought some goodies here awhile ago, never had cannelloni, was so looking forward to it!  So very disappointed!  It was nasty!  Never again!!
My stepdaughters neighbor made her some for Christmas, WOW!  Now I'm sure that is what cannelloni is supposed to be like!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"If you are a woman, this place can be a quite a turnoff. You have to run the gamut of the stinky old men sitting outside the door who will ogle you up and down before you go in, so that you are not sure who is the consumer, and what is the product. This experience gave me such a disgusting feeling that I left without purchasing. You might argue this is an 'authentic experience', but if that is the case, count me out! Too bad because they have a great selection of hard to find items. But I couldn't get over that creepy feeling. . .",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"WHOA. This place is all kinds of freakin' WOW! I don't even know where to start. I just went in because I'd been meaning to for so long, and I finally had a chance. I was really overwhelmed, but made mental notes as I walked the aisles. It will be easier once I know what I want. 

I settled for a calzone, white chocolate and strawberry tart and blood orange soda to go. Couldn't help but notice the ""No alcohol past this point' sign. Wait...does that mean I could have sat and had a drink with my lunch? Coooool!

I was on my way out the door with my take-out when I noticed they had an entire section devoted to kitchen gadgets and dishware. I picked up a couple of cute gifts. I can't wait to drag my troll over to see it!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"absolutely love shopping here, the product and service is consistently great!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Great selection of products. Prices are slightly higher than bigger grocery stores, but I find their fresh products of high quality. They also have a larger selection of Italian and Mediterranean products, as expected. The bakery/cafe is unbelievably. Everything taste good. Their deli sandwiches and salads are also yummy.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Love this place, clean, bustling, wonderful, wonderful deli, the in-house smoked salmon is ridiculous!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Its about time!

Competitive Prices, clean, fresh, attentive staff, no line ups, easy parking, and of course great selection of food.. 

I wont shop anywhere else, unless I need purchase to butcher meats.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
Always a great place to have my decaf Americano and fancy dessert. They have tons to choose from. Sometimes we like to come here for their soup & sandwiches or their pizza  Service is great and very sanitary!,71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Great shop, newest location in the west end of Edmonton. Usually drop in 2 or 3 times a month. I like going in for the deserts and European chocolate. Great Deli counter too, but also enjoy the bakery and getting fresh euro style hearty bread. The cafe section is usually busy, a little small, so it always looks full. Parking can be a problem its so popular. I do find things little pricey, its not a discount store but everything seems good quality. Fun to explore new food and European imports. Lots of actual Italian people coming through too, so nice integration with the community. Also they support local news papers with a bunch of different racks at the exit door, nice to see.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Literally my favourite grocery store in the city. It can be a pain to get into - you have to drive in the far right lane that also leads to WEM (traffic leading to WEM is always a pain), and then parking can be tricky.

BUT, once you get in....

All the chocolate! All the pasta! All the meat! All the cheese! ALL OF IT!

Seriously, they stock great quality imported products for prices that I would actually pay (spoiler alert: I'm cheap!). Milka chocolate bars are $2. Meats are all super reasonable... it's around $2-$3 for 100 grams of proscuitto (whatttttt?), cheeses are normal prices, pastas are like $2 a box.

It's actually insane. I always expect import stores to be more expensive, but this one is not and they have a crazy selection of European goods (not just Italian!).

My favourite Italian store treat: homemade pizza. You can get a baggie of fresh dough for $1.50, pick your meats and cheeses, and you'll have a delicious homemade pizza for under $10. (you can also get the dough in 4 packs in the freezer section for like $5 - again, recommended to always keep a bag in your freezer). There's no instructions on the dough, but I find that about 10-12 minutes at 400 F makes a perfect pizza every time.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"LOVE this store - be sure to visit when you have time to stroll down the aisles and discover all sorts of goodies you'll never see at your local grocery chain - I could have filled three carts with things that sounded heavenly!

The deli section is filled with meats and cheeses I've never heard of before, and they'll gladly let you sample.  But over to the left of those huge cases is an olive lover's dream - literally dozens of olives, every flavour imaginable, and again the helpful staff will let you sample ... and sample.... and sample.   My very favourite was a sweet pepper stuffed with feta cheese, but close runners-up were a sun-dried tomato olive stuffed with almond and a rosemary with feta stuffing.   There's even a 5 Alarm olive, and yes, if you must, there are plain ones in several colours.

The bakery is a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds, with beautiful confections.  Next time I want to try the gelato, but had simply run out of time to sit in the little eating area and indulge, after exploring the rest of the store.

Definitely worth discovering this delightful shop!!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"This wasn't my first visit to the Italian Centre, but my last visit was many years ago and all I could remember was the huge selection of charcuterie and cheeses. Slightly overwhelming to say the least, meats and cheeses (at the time) I had never even heard of. With some guidance from the staff I was able to select some delights. 

Fast forward a few years... 

My most recent visit was only for some pastries and a quick lunch, so I didn't have time to browse the huge selection of Italian delights. 

I decided to go with the Mossimo pizza. The toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly! The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I wasn't expecting such a huge pizza- definitely big enough to share! And priced at just $14? A steal if you ask me!

For pastries we chose the Cream Horns; while they were quite pricy, they were certainly delicious. Likely made that day, they were fresh, creamy and flakey! Impossible not to over indulge! 

While visiting the Italian Centre I suggest enjoying a freshly crafted coffee beverage and a pastry. The perfect treat before or after shopping.",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"Amazing atmosphere!  Great baked goods, will go back and check out more soon!
Cafe was so busy, you know it has to be great!",71MulAHeKm5p2kIIGYEwpA
"A local gem with excellent, reasonably priced, no frills food. The service is friendly and reasonably prompt, especially when one person is serving the whole room. Their omelettes are soft and well seasoned. Their pancakes are huge and fluffy. Also the home made ketchup is awesome. 5 stars reflects the fact that in the world of online reviews, 4 stars is second tier, and anything below that undesirable. 5 stars also reflects that relative to other places, the price, quality of food, and good service make this place an easy recommendation. Support local!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Hands down the best breakfast burger in Edmonton.
Amazing homemade patty,  has to be 1/3 pound. THICK slice of ham, 2 THICK slices of bacon, 1 egg anyway you want it. Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle on a huge fresh bun. I've eaten here about 10 times and it's always consistent, always fresh, and always great service. I haven't really tried more than a bite of anything else, but all seems to be great. I seriously crave this burger from time to time. I have now dubbed it the ""Meatsweat naptime"" burger.
Oh...and if the burger isn't enough,  they are always happy to oblige my request of turning my pan fries into a poutine. This is the ONLY place that I feel like I get what I'm paying for when I'm out on the burger hunt. Their hours could suit my needs a bit better but all in all,  it's probably best to eat this beast a little earlier in the day.  Go get one!!!!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"This place is amazing, great food, service, and prices. So much to choose from. We reserved a table for a bunch of us for a surprise bday brunch for a family member. Even though it's right on Whyte Ave, its not near the craziness, so finding parking was easy. However, its close enough to walk to the busier part, which is exactly what we did right after enjoying a great brunch. The only negative thing was they didn't specify that gratuity was already added on to the bill, so when anyone added on a tip they didn't say anything. So my advice to anyone if booking with a big group, make sure gratuity is already added to the bill before adding your own tip. Other than that it was an excellent experience right from the beginning.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I like to come to Tasty Tom's on Saturday morning. It is comfort food for me after a week of hard work. It is a tiny diner, family owned and operated. Food is solid with big portion, I can rarely finish it in one setting. 
Recommended to a few of my friends, haven't had any bad reviews so far. It is not a fancy place, but it is warm and welcoming.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"You know those times where someone recommends a place to eat, so you try it out, and it's a bit of a disappointment...well maybe she meant somewhere else; maybe it's changed ownership since her last visit?!  Not exactly sure what's up, but I certainly did not leave with the same warm & fuzzies.

The flower dispaly was a little...crunchie.  The decor was a little...dusty.  The service was pretty good from the wait staff, but when my bf asked for a hardboiled egg (like, is this really an unusal request??) the look of hesitation was kind of cute.  Something along the lines of ""I don't think our Chef will know what that means.""  ...I kid you not!?

In all honesty the pancakes I had were actually really good.  But after pulling out the fuzzies from his french toast, I don't think I could convince the BF to join me for breakfast there again.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"My friend and I try to find new places to brunch each month and Tasty Tom's is the only place we have returned to a few times now. It's small, cozy, friendly and the food is always a knockout! 

Go early or be prepared to wait awhile for a seat but it's worth it. The prices are super reasonable and everything I have tried I love.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
Always a good breakfast/lunch choice. The hashbrowns and fries are fantastic. I love the monte cristo and the garlic mushroom burger. They are less busy now under new management but the food is just as great as ever.,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
Amazing gourmet burgers with sliced chips and homemade ketchup! Stunning! Just cannot get enough of this place!,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ

"Went there for a late Sunday breakfast after reading some reviews that it was very good. I was definitely not disappointed! I had the farmers omelette with hash browns and toast. The omelette was delicious, cooked perfectly with a ton of fillings all mixed in - exactly the way I like it. The hash towns were amazing, soft and crispy with great seasoning. The toast kind of sucked but...its toast. Excellent coffee, great service, very clean - nothing fancy just great food. Definitely not someplace I would even consider going if I hadn't read the reviews so thanks again Yelp!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"If you come here on Saturday, be prepared to wait for a table. On weekdays it's not quite so busy. I've had breakfast here before and it's both huge and delicious. Today I ordered a Reuben sandwich for lunch. It is the second best Reuben that I have ever tasted. The best was in Omaha, Nebraska where a local directed my group to a place I would otherwise not enter. I was told that the Reuben was invented in Omaha. I don't know if that is true but it was Reuben heaven.   So when I say that Tasty Tom's makes the second best Reuben you understand that I mean that as high praise. Omaha is too far to go for lunch (although it's a tempting idea). I highly recommend Tasty Tom's for taking traditional food and making it much better than average.  Do try the in-house made ketchup as it is what ketchup is supposed to taste like.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Recently stopped in for a quick afternoon snack with my girl. Neat little place. Small cozy and off the crazy busy side of Whyte Ave. I order and receive what I'm going to call the best fish and chips I've ever had. Like I consider myself an ace in the kitchen, but I'll admit this place gives me a run for my money big time. First of all let me tell you that they make all of their own sauces here including the spicy ketchup. I loved the ketchup but it's a little on the watery side so don't be surprised. Nothing artificial in it so that's why it was exclaimed to me. Tarter sauce? Amazing and also made from scratch. I order 2 portions of that. And this is the only place I've ever seen that gives you a yellow curry sauce with your fish that looks like mustard. I actually thought it was mustard and weird to have with fish. Until I tried it. Wow! This is how you are supposed to eat fish! Never would have thought it. Anyways back to the fish. Beautiful light batter and perfectly cooked. The fish was flaky and juicy from the first to the last bite. Huge piece of fish as well. Be aware that I mean it when I say juicy. Some of the batter was getting a little soggy at the end but I didn't care as I was shoveling fork after fork into my face. I ordered a poutine to go with my fish. So that came on its own plate as it was huge. Oh did I forget to mention your fish comes with like half a plate of Cesar salad as well? No one told me this! Surprise! You're gonna be in food coma after eating all of this food. And to top it all off my girlfriend orders the bruschetta which was equally delightful and out come like 8 pieces. Of course she wants me to eat some. Anyways I happily survived and the food really was top quality here. I'm going back soon to try their chili burgers. You have got to come and try this place for yourself.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I've been going to Tasty Tom's for a few years, but hadn't been there in a while before my last visit. However, pretty quickly after returning, I realized that they had new owners and the business had been sold. So I had what I usually get - the blue cheese burger - and for the most part, it was the same. With the burger, the quality wasn't quite what I remembered, but it was pretty close. And they still had the same recipe for the in-house, custom ketchup that is excellent and seems to have a slight curry flavour to it. But instead of fries, they had served cut potato wedges. However they were a little burned. Mind you, it's been a little while since I was there, and I need to go back and see if the new owners have progressed at all. It goes without saying that there will be an adjustment period after you purchase a business.

As for the interior, it's nothing special, and that's fine. It's not a place to go for the ""ambiance"". It's a locally owned burger place. And the service did seem to be improved from how it used to be, so that's a plus. I'll go back shortly and reevaluate things.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Seasoned party is tasty. Sesame bun is generic (a better bun could nicely complement the burger). Chips are nice and crunchy!

The house blend ketchup is more tangy and less ketchupy.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ

"Best wiener schnitzel in town.
Hours are limited, so don't  expect to linger over your long lunch.
The fried potatoes are much improved since I started coming here 15 years ago.  
It's a very pleasant place to have a home cooked meal.  I never see little  kids here, so that's a bonus for me.  
The staff is very attentive.  
There are weekly specials.
I should come here more often.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Sadly, I was terribly unimpressed.  We arrived on Sunday morning around 9 am.  There was only one other couple in the restaurant and one server was working at the time.  

It is a cute little place.  And i imagine they can get pretty packed.  But I won't be back.  We ordered coffee, water, and orange juice.  The coffee was disgusting.  Completely undrinkable in fact.  I think maybe the grounds might have been old because the coffee didn't lighten up when cream was added.  When we pointed it out to the server and told her we couldn't drink it, she essentially said ""oh, weird"", and left the full cups sitting on the table for our entire visit.  We didn't touch them again, and were disappointed when we were charged for them.

I ordered sausage and eggs.  The sausage was good, but wasn't anything I couldn't get somewhere else.  My eggs had no colour to them at all but were oddly shiny.  I can't describe them.  My mom used to make scrambled eggs in the microwave, and this kind of reminded me of them.  And the hashbrowns looked great, but were surprisingly bland.  Even the toast was bland.  I ate the sausages, but not much of anything else.  The server stood at the till during our entire meal.  She didn't check on us.  We even had to call her over to bring some more syrup.  We weren't given a check, so we just went up to the counter to pay.  We still weren't given checks, just told what our totals were.

Prices were good... but not when you consider how little of it I actually ate.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"My husband and I come here for lunch on a regular basis. The server is always very sweet and friendly, the portions are tremendous, and I really like the food. Their homemade ketchup is delish. Small and quiet, simple menu of breakfast, burgers, and sandwiches mostly. 

I can't recommend any particular thing, but their fries are really crispy (which I love!!). I haven't had anything I disliked though. 

I hear they have a patio in the back? I have yet to see it though.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Schnitzel Egg's Benedict and Bacon Egg's Benedict

I love breakfast food but I usually skip this meal. That's why weekends are best for stuff your face full of bacon and some sort of yolky egg. Tasty Tom's has your bfast fix if you want french toast, pancakes. omelettes or even steak and eggs. The day we went it was Benedict central. The schnitzel egg's benedict was huge. Portions were large, the egg was soft and the hollandaise was citrus flavored. Schnitzel was cooked traditionally, quite thin and well fried. Bacon and egg's was pretty much the same but with juicy bacon. Forgot to mention that it was also served with hash as well. Not overly crispy either, had a good texture yknow? 

Located on Whyte ave near 100 st, this place is an ok spot for bfast. The interior is old school and service was great. Would go back to try everything else here for breakfast.

Sal says: Just Try It (3.5/5)
Chloe says: Pretty decent. Well made egg. I prefer a richer hollandaise. The bacon was nicely cooked",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I used to live near by and always wondered what smelled so good but never bothered to check it out.... turns out I was missing out! The prices are very reasonable. The boyfriend and I came for breakfast and though it is cozy inside we were waiting less than 2 minutes before they had us seated! I got the daily special omelet (sp?) with Montreal smoked meat, Swiss cheese, spinach and mushrooms... it was incredible! Their housemade ketchup is divine on the potatoes! We will be coming back!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"It's really 3.75 but Yelp does not let me be as nasty as I wanna be which is why I prefer Janet but this is not a review of her or Yelp, so back on track. Toms has good but not great food in large portions for very fair prices. The staff are pleasant and the decor is Marge as in nothing changed since 1958 and it's gone past gross to that rare air of authenticity funky. There is a lot to like about this little place the ""ketchup"" on the table
Is laced with curry and cumin and really not great so it's perfect for this place. You should go!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
Amazing food and wonderful service! Tried the hash special and the two egg breakfast (subbed the pan fried potatoes with home fries). I always forget how delicious the food is here! It looks/sounds very simple but tastes very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The bacon was fried crispy but not oily. Home fries were perfectly crispy and fluffy on the inside. Hash had generous amount of cheese and meat. Server was really nice and friendly.,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Great service but super over-priced mediocre food. Potatoes were not properly done -- still quite raw. Quality of bacon is questionable -- it's almost the same kind of jelly-like bacon you find at fast food restaurants. I remember this place used to be a whole lot better, especially their home-made ketchup. Coffee was also awful as it tasted burnt. We ate four hours ago and still feel pretty sick. Sorry, it's gone from Tasty Tom's to Tasty Bomb. We're never coming back.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Yum yum yum! My friend and I went here for breakfast last weekend and were thoroughly impressed. 
I am a breakfast fanatic and although I am easily pleased with anything concerning eggs and hollandaise, the eggs Benedict here was fantastic. The food was also out very quickly.
My only complaints were the somewhat slow service and the weird, homemade ketchup that I'm sure many people actually love!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Extremely limited menu (breakfast eggs pancakes etc, and burgers and a few sandwiches). I had a burger which was ok a little bland but not bad. Prices are low which is nice. The atmosphere is pretty drab very boring music playing softly in the back and a few painting which seem to be from local artists for sale. Absolutely nothing about this place stands out. They need to expand their menu. A few specialty items could make this place worth coming back to.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I had been to Tasty Toms many years ago, and thought it was decent - nothing to write home about, but OK.

Today we decided to visit for brunch. I asked for a half order of the 4 egg omelette, my fiance got the pancakes, my MIL got the 2 egg breakfast. The server was very busy, and we waited a long time for coffee to be refilled, but we brushed it off. 

The 2 egg breakfast was quite large, My omelette was just the right size, and tasted fine, except the cheese was the american sliced cheese kind, which is always disappointing.

Halfway through my fiance's pancakes, he looked down to find an adult sized (dead) mealworm cooked into the cake. He promptly brought the dish to the counter, & the 3 off us promptly lost our appetites. The server apologized and asked if he wanted another dish, but he declined.

When we received the bill,  the pancakes had been removed, however, my 2 egg (half size omelette) has charged full price, even though half size was noted on the bill. The total for 2 mediocre ( & half eaten, due to worm incident) breakfasts and 3 coffees came to $39.00. 

The 3 of us will not be returning to this establishment.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Tried Tasty Tom's this weekend for the first time and it was amazing! I ordered the Breakfast Schnitzel and the pork cutlet that came with it was absolutely delicious. Everything on my plate was so tasty! This is a cute little restaurant on whyte with amazing food. I highly recommend coming here. Our waitress was very personable, friendly and attentitive to us. I very much enjoyed my breakfast. The fresh fruit that came on the side with my breakfast was also very good. It added a good balance to the meal. It was quite a big serving for the amount that we paid and the meal was totally worth it. I love that they have their own in house ketchup! The ketchup itself had a nice sweet tangy taste to it and added a nice flavour to the yummy potatoes that came with the Breakfast. I am definitely coming back here!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ

"I love coming to Tasty Tom's for breakfast as it never disappoints. The breakfast montecristo is my favourite. It's sweet from the addition of pear, but still crunchy and savoury and buttery. It's definitely the ultimate breakfast sandwich for me. I've also had the bruschetta omelet, and it is delicious. It's super light, and I like the processed cheese in. 

My friends and I come here a lot, but it's not just the food, it's the fast, attentive service, and the homey feel.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"They must have done something at Tasty Tom's in 2013; turning over a new leaf? A guy friend and I went here for burgers and fries after watching a play at the Fringe. I had the fish burger while my friend had their schnitzel burger. It was delicious and the portions are generous. However, when it was time to pack up our leftovers, the server unceremoniously threw out my friend's leftovers while she packed mine. She felt pretty bad and gave us a plate of dessert to share -- on the house.

Just a few weekends ago, my fiance and I came here for breakfast. Their spinach omelette, with brie and crabcakes, was on special -- it was so good. I've always liked the option of having rye toast with breakfast. The quality of food has really improved consistently since my last review. Tasty Tom's is Tasty again!!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Tasty Tom√¢s is not the place you√¢d go if you√¢re trying to eat lean or low-calorie. Everything on the menu is rich. They like to use lots of butter and cream in their cooking, and that√¢s probably why it tastes so good. Tasty Tom√¢s is the kind of place you get irrepressible cravings for, and must satiate or be tortured by dreams of decadent Rubens until you do. Their sandwiches are rich but delicious, almost too heavy if you√¢re not in the mood to feel stuffed. I√¢ve also had one of the best burgers here ever. Service is fast; the food comes in five to 10 minutes. The space is small and cozy, but not a place you√¢d come to for privacy because the tables are really close together. You come here to eat! The fries, I recall, are a bit greasy for my liking, but some people would love that. I wouldn√¢t classify this as fast food, √¢because they also serve pastas, sandwiches, etc. It√¢s just the service that√¢s swift.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I've been walking by this restaurant for 4 years. I honestly think the outside signage makes it look run down and not very inviting. Decided to give the place a shot today. Glad I did. 

Its a small diner. I think 8 tables. It wasn't super busy. I walked in and the waitress said to pick a seat. Got our drinks ordered and our food shortly thereafter. 

I honestly thought the portion sizes were good! I guess your meal comes with fruit as well. The fries were diced potatos deep fried I think. Still delicious. Their ketchup was interesting, a nice twist. 

I definitely recommend the place!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ

"Hard review.  Sorely tempted to leave 3 stars because they use processed cheese leaving your omelette tasting of cheese whiz BUT the specialty homemade curried ketchup, funky interior with small cafe appeal, large portions and great potatoes are still a win for me.  I did have a rather impassioned discussion with the staff about how real cheese should at least be added to the menu as an extra because the cheese they are using tastes like drekk and avoiding that gastronomic disaster would be worth an extra dollar or two.  I miss the crooked floors but there is still plenty of unique appeal.  The sandwiches are above average too.  So bring the real cheese and I'll bring my happy business!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ

"Yuck! Don't waste your time or money here. I ordered their Eggs Benedict which was just awful. I have never seen such bizarre Hollandaise sauce and they topped it off with a slice of American Cheese. Gross. 

I did send it back and received eggs and sausage which was no better. The sausage oozed some bizarre grease and had chunks of fat in it. The eggs were weird too! 

The service was very good but sadly that isn't the reason most of us choose our restaurants.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"This was our first time going to this restaurant. We've been meaning to go here for awhile. We were the very first customers today, got there right when they opened at 11am. 

The interior was quite homey and rustic, but inviting. Looks like a great place to go to grab a bite or to meet a friend. 

The food was excellent! They have a very unique way of preparing their fries. They cut them in a way that makes them seem both like potato chips and french fries at the same time. They were very good, and quite unique, and I will definitely come back to try them again. 

Their Rueben sandwich was also very good. Good flavour, meat was tasty, and it had a nice toast on the outside. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a nice little diner on Whyte Ave.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I always walked past this place without going in because it looks like a dive from the outside, but one fine summer morning my boyfriend finally convinced me we should give it a try. It was a Saturday morning and the place was about 3/4 full, which surprised me... and then it didn't.  Half the crowd was of the mature variety and the other half was of the probably-hungover variety. The decor inside invoked fond memories of an old local family restaurant in my hometown and I appreciated the touch of nostalgia it added.  The food is certainly not for the calorie conscious, as it is your good-old-fashioned home-style cookin' with plenty of carbs and a decent dollop of grease.  The breakfast portions are huge, so show up hungry and ready to hit the gym afterwards! This is a great place to go when you're craving a classic farmer breakfast, and for me it's a super convenient walk from where I live, so that's a huge bonus. I appreciate the uniqueness of the ketchup, but I do find it a bit odd.  A bit too spicy - I like my traditional Heinz ketchup when I'm eating a massive plate of hash browns, eggs and bacon - but that's just me.  I also found the hash browns a bit too spicy as well, which was odd but not off-putting.  The seasoning certainly puts a unique twist on a classic breakfast. Anyone who is curious about Tasty Tom's should definitely try it at least once!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Walked and greeted right away. The food cake fast and there was way too much to eat. The quality of the food is fine and just average breakfast food.

Very good deal.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Tasty Tom's
9965 - 82 Ave
Edmonton, Alberta.

What do you know, it's GROUPON time again!

My thrifty ass had a Groupon for $20.00 towards a meal at Tasty Tom's on Whyte Avenue in Edmonton.

Now let me tell you what I know about Tasty Tom's. Back in the day (the day being like, late '90‚Ä≤s), I lived just a few blocks from this joint and they had a menu that had a lot of German cuisine on it. Schnitzel, sauerkraut, European wieners, and great beer. When they opened, they gave me my first experience of a Cuban Sandwich. (Yes. Cuban. Who am I to question it?) Anyway, if you don't know what a Cuban sandwich is, it's pretty much a menage a trois of sliced pork, sliced ham and awesome swiss cheese on a ciabatta bed with mustard, pickles and other condiments in the mix. Then the whole sandwich was toasted panini style - waaaay before paninis were the shit.

I LOVED this sandwich. They at one point took it off the menu, which made me cry, but they said would still make it on MY request. (well, and probably others' requests as well, but I like to think I'm special.) That made me happy again.

Anyway, I moved away from the area and stopped going to Tasty Tom's but always had fond memories of the great times I had there with friends, and the fantastic food. So when the deal showed up in my Groupon email, I took it, anticipating another great meal... and at the back of my mind, the most faintest little itty bitty hope that I might again have my beloved Cuban sandwich. HEY! A girl can dream, right?

Even being under new management since the middle of 2013, (so no Cuban sandwich for me), the decor was about the same that I'd remembered. I wasn't really sure if that was good or bad, actually. Simple and unassuming, a mishmash of different tables and chairs, but clean. My friend and I were told we could pick our table, so we did, made ourselves comfortable, and service began.

After checking out both menus (breakfast that goes till 3, and lunch that goes til 5.......... odd, but ok), I decided upon the Schnitzel Burger (Breaded pork cutlet, Swiss, mustard, mayonnaise). My friend chose The Weiner Schnitzel (Breaded pork cutlet with lemon and potato salad). Those descriptions were taken verbatim, so I had to wonder, did they pay the printer by the word or something? Wouldn't one want to snazz up those descriptions just a tad??

Anyway.. here's my Schnitzel Burger:
(sorry for the crappy phone pic!!)

(www.forkinfoodie.com)

Sooooo yeah. What can I say about this thing? I had asked her how thick the schnitzel was before ordering and she said it was a thick piece. Well, if by thick she meant really thin, then I believe she was correct. The burger came to the table looking ridiculous. Thin and long, the schnitzel overhung the bun by a few inches on either side - I mean, why not slice that beast (skinny beast) in half, bread both pieces and double-decker it?? Then, just to make it that extra bit worse, they used one slice of barely melted, cheap processed ""swiss"" cheese on top.

Culinary mastery right there, folks.

Taste? Sigh. It was booking first class on the bland wagon even with all its accompaniments in tow. I actually had to ask for extra mustard because the slight little swipe that was put on the bun was simply a tease. The cutlet was dry as a popcorn fart and simply flavorless,.... oh, unless you wanted to call a bit of old oil taste from the deep-fried breading, flavor.

The home fries on the plate were plentiful and super yummy, but the house brand ""ketchup"" was like watered down Heinz 57 mixed with weirdness. I didn't like it.

My friend's plate:

My friends meal was basically the exact same schnitzel that was on my burger, but on a plate.  And sadly, tasted the same way as well. Dry, dry, dry. So terribly overcooked. Even the slice of lemon couldn't save that poor pork cutlet. Now, I understand that schnitzel is not a dish that wins first place at the spice fair, but I've had really good schnitzel in the past. The flavor comes from the combination of a fresh-cut piece of meat, nice breading, and clean oil. Oh, and not frying the living crap out of it helps. This little cutlet was tired. VERY tired. The potato salad on the plate was pretty decent though, but not good enough.

Gone are the days of my beloved Cuban sandwich and excellent German food. The whole meal was a huge disappointment and not even close to being the tasty part of Tasty Tom's.  It seems as though management has given up and don't care about the quality of food they present. Here's a great tip: Just down the road a few blocks is K&K Foodliner. A German owned food import store and deli. They have everything you could want to make wicked schnitzel......

the REAL schmackhaft, or, tasty way.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ

"I like a good hamburger and the local barber recommended Tasty Tom's. It is a small quaint burger shop that also offers schnitzels and other menu items. With each meal you receive a small bowl of fruit. As for the food, the burgers are great. Nice and hearty with some good flavours. I haven't had anything else from the menu but I would imagine that it should be good. Fries are great and they offer either a regular ketchup or a homemade version. The homemade version reminds me of a sauce that would go with a samosa. Some eastern influences which is quite nice.

The only thing of concern is their hours of operation. Often I would like to go in but find them closed. I hope that they will be able to have regular hour that will attract the evening crowd.

Great place and great service for this quaint restaurant!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Came here for brunch with a gift certificate.  Impressed with the speed and serving size, and left rather satisfied! Service was a little hard to understand (ESL), but not an issue. The restaurant interior is a little cheap/dated.

"Kelly T said lunch was a horror show, but ""maybe this is a good breakfast place.""  Nope, it's an actual dump for breakfast as well I am sorry to say. I am truly amazed by the positive, and recent, reviews. We did eat at the same place?? My friend ordered eggs Benedict and I ordered a Monte Cristo (ham and cheese and, here, sliced pear sandwich on French Toast).  

The Hollandaise is certainly not legit made-in-house sauce, and it's not even foodservice product - a 3-lb frozen bag of premade Hollandaise looks creamier and richer than the wan yellow puddles they ladle over the breakfasts here - except my friend didn't get to finish hers because when she cut into her second egg the uncooked white slid off the muffin right along with the yolk... she pointed it out to the waitress who asked if she wanted a replacement; my friend said even the first egg Benedict hadn't been that good, so could she just have an order of toast?  Certainly! Certainly she could! And they wouldn't comp that for her, either, as it turned out when the bill arrived!  

Meanwhile, I was puzzling over why they would put a canned pear on a mandoline to make paper-thin slices for a Monte Cristo, and why did the ""home fries""/hash browns taste so STRANGE?  I finally figured it out -- TURMERIC.  Lots and lots of turmeric.  To make them golden yellow. Instead of cooking them properly. I was able to see this with my own eyes when my friend finally went up to the till to pay when we were unable to catch the waitress' eye after extended efforts, and I saw the tired-looking man behind the grill take a generous serving-spoonful of yellow powder from above the grill and dump it on to the new portion he was starting on the griddle.  Ugh.  

Honestly, it could hardly have been worse; I'd take a chain restaurant 100 times before I'd come back here.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ

"My friend suggested we eat that this place for lunch because he said they made the best f-ing Reuben sammich in YEG. But he hadn't been there in like 10 years. So we decided to give it a go one wonderful afternoon. 

Upon entering the place it was a good sign that there were other people also eating there. There is nothing worse than going into an establishment being the only people there. Very awkward. 

The decor is quite dated in this place. From the outside this diner looks like nothing special. In fact you may think this place is a dive and the food will be gross. Don't let the look fool you. 

I ordered the schnitzel rueben sammich with home cut fries. I've had other Reuben's before but this one was fantastic.  The schnitzel was cooked well, the sauerkraut was juicy and well balanced with the sauce and mustard. Plus the toasted bread was crunchy and epic soft with each bite. The home cut fries were interesting. I've never had fries that were cut in this fashion before. They were crispy like potato chips. My friend said to try their homemade ketchup. Yup! Worth it!!!!  It's got a great flavouring that is a bit spicy with a hint of bbq. I really enjoyed it. 

If you are looking for a lunch meal for under 14 bucks that will fill you up. Go here for a Rueben. It's worth every penny.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I hate it when I am initially thrilled with a restaurant, only to have subsequent visits disappoint me. Such is the case with Tasty Tom's. I have had the steak and eggs again recently, and found the steak to be a poor cut of meat, full of fat and gristle. On the most recent visit, I ordered a vegetarian omelette without cheese - it arrived full of cheese. Fortunately, it was quickly replaced, but if I did like cheese I would have been disappointed, as it appeared to be processed cheese-like substance. And on the other side of the table was steak and eggs yet again - except the steak was over-sooked. It was replaced, and the same problem was repeated - too brown, through and through. And those potatoes I first raved about? Under-seasoned and under-cooked. We won't be back.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
This is an awesome little restaurant.   We just had a delightful breakfast of French toast for me and two eggs scrambled for her.  She raved about the pan fries.....I raved about the toast.  We are clearly raving lunatics.....but this place has just become a favorite.,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"One of my favourite breakfast places in Edmonton! Huge portions, delicious homemade ketchup and the hashbrowns are SO good. Legit I crave Tasty Tom's hashbrowns when I have hashbrowns other places. Definitely check out what their specials are when you're there too because they're always goooooooood!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Many years ago, a friend of mine owned a fish and chip joint in this location, and I had many fond memories. I had been meaning over the years to try the Tasty Tom's incarnation, but had never quite got around to it.
My loss...
This last Sunday, I was on the prowl for brunch, and was looking for something new. Driving down Whyte, I saw the sign, and decided to roll in.
There were a couple of tables lingering over their breakfast as I entered, but the place was not full.
I selected a table, and the friendly server was right there with a menu and coffee.
I perused the menu, and at first glance, I thought the prices a tad high, but then I saw the portions, and adjusted my opinion.

I ordered a pretty standard 2 egg breakfast (scrambled, sausages, rye toast, hashbrowns.)
My food came quickly, as I was enjoying the delicious fresh coffee, and I was set back by the size of the plate. There were enough hashbrowns to feed a family of 4, and an added fruit bowl that was a pleasant and delicious addition.

The food was superb. Easily one of the best breakfasts I have had in a while.
The eggs were creamy and perfectly cooked, the sausage was amazing, and the hashbrowns were fresh cut chunks of potato, perfectly seasoned and cooked. Even the toast seemed better than usual...

Tasty Toms have their own ketchup recipe and there is a bottle on every table. It is rich and delicious, and I highly recommend it. Go light... it is flavourful.

I will definitely be a return customer.
The building is old and the decor is ""low budget rustic"" but there are homey touches throughout, and I found the space very relaxing and comfortable. It had changed little from when my friend owned his chippie, so my sense of nostalgia remained fully intact.

I recommend Tasty Toms very highly. I very much look forward to trying other menu items.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
Breakfast was delicious. Kid friendly with a good kids menu. The schnitzel breakfast was big and tasted just like a home cooked meal.  The restaurant was very clean with attentive staff.,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"A decent breakfast for a fair price and free parking on Whyte Ave, and it's not Humpty's! Get outta town! (and into Tasty Tom's)

We were pleasantly surprised by our first visit. The food, although not great, is good and the portions are very generous. I quite liked the spiced ketchup. My companion loved the pan-fried potatoes. I'd recommend sharing a breakfast like the pizza pita. It wasn't really a pita, more like a thin crust pizza that wasn't cooked much before it had toppings added to it. It was ok. You can tell the ingredients are inexpensive, which one should expect for the price and size.

The space is small but homey with lots of natural lighting. The fresh carnations on each table was a nice touch, as is the different and local artwork decorating the walls. The server was quietly friendly, polite and prompt, and kept our glasses filled. 

Way better than Humpty's, but not worth a 4 star rating, it's A-Ok, solid 3 stars. If I lived closer by, I'd be more likely to come back for a beer. Alley Kat on tap, $4/10 oz, $7/20 oz. Why isn't there a cozy little local place like this in every neighbourhood?",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
Fantastic breakfast!  Schnitzel and eggs was the perfect choice. Very friendly service. Hidden gem on east White Ave.,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
Great place for breakfast or brunch.  Cosy inside and kind of retro.  Even has a bar counter. Large portions.  Good prices. Friendly staff.  Bottomless coffee. Good for people watching by the window. My omelette was huge.  Variety of breads. They have their own proprietary ketchup which takes getting used to.   It loses a star because they use processed cheese the omelette. I would gladly pay an extra 25c for real cheddar.  Real cheddar is also healthier.  Note to staff.,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"So, I have had a dream for a while now of a pizza made with breakfast stuff you can eat in the morning.  Today that dream was made manifest.  Tasty Tom's makes a breakfast pita pizza.  It was not all I had envisioned, and to make it to my tastes, I see several improvements I would make,but it was still great.  And Tony said his omelette was good too.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Went for a late breakfast and was not disappointed! My boyfriend and I eat had omelettes, and the plates were huge! With toast, potatoes, and fruit, it was definitely a brunch. I will be coming back!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Tasty Tom's makes you feel like you are in a diner from the eighties. 

I have had the big breakfast here which includes two eggs, two Texas toast, two bacon, two sausage, a piece of ham and home fries. It came to around $11. The food is prepared with care and they don't make anything overly greasy. They made the eggs EXACTLY how I wanted and the home fries were delicious.

For a small diner they go above and beyond expectations. They have such generous portions and the best food. I was very impressed. It was probably the best breakfast and best bang for my buck that I have had in a long time. I would love to go back in the evening to see if it's just as good.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I visited Tasty Tom's today and have to say I was a bit surprised. The outside doesn't look like much, but the interior was nice with a not so subtle hipster vibe. It's a small place and barely accommodated the five of us so probably not the best venue for larger groups.

Now to the important stuff. Servers were nice and attentive. They have interesting menu options -they offer a brie, walnut and maple syrup omelette which someone at our table ordered. They said it was a bit odd having the egg and maple syrup together, but not bad. 

I found the portions to be a good size and I particularly liked the hashbrowns. They had onions in them and were delicious pared with Tom's house ketchup. I always find homemade ketchup a treat. Also, these guys do not skimp on the bacon!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Tasty Tom's is right near my office, which is one of the reasons I go there often.  Unlike many others that are near my office, I go back because it is so good.

I'll admit, Tasty Toms is not for the calorie counter.  It is not good for my waistline or my breath, but man is the food good, and I'm pretty sure I've had everything on the menu at this point.

It's definitely my favourite spot in Old Strathcona and it's a bit of a throwback in the sense that the owner is in the kitchen sharing his craft with the customers.  

If you really want a treat get the Chicken Rueben, the Fish and Chips, or one of their delicious burgers.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"A really homey diner with brunch, sandwiches, German-inspired entrees, and burgers. I had the steak and eggs and everything was cooked exactly to order. I especially liked the home fries which are some of the best I have had in ages - the potato was freshly cut, seasoned, and the fried onions just took it up to another level. The steak was broiled, soft, and marinated, but had a lot of gristle on it - tasted good though. I definitely plan to come here again - I have got to have those potatoes!",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"No. Just... no.

Look, I know Edmonton has a serious problem distinguishing a charming dive with an actual dump, but this place falls squarely into the latter. Horrible food for a inflated price in a charmless brown grease trap. Oh, no. NO.

I brought my kid here for lunch a few weeks ago. Maybe that was my mistake. Maybe this is a good breakfast place. But around noon it's a flipping horror show. A grilled cheese sandwich thrown artlessly on a plate is fine for a toddler, but the sopping wet chicken cordon blue was a hate crime against my taste buds. Greasy bread falling to pieces as it arrived at my table coupled with salad the flavor of dryer lint. Oh, no.

And to top off the entire experience, I'll tip my hat at what appeared to be a prostitute working the corner across the street, who then came into the restaurant for lunch. If I were still in college, I'd probably think that was funny. But I really can't see myself coming here ever again, no matter how funny I might have once found it.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I love the atmosphere here, it's such an authentic small business and an icon for the Whyte ave area. 

They do a mean schnitzel and definitely make sure you head here for their breakfast when you have had a big night, it's the best hangover cure! 

I'm only giving them 4 stars because they got rid of their crab ceaser salad, and that was pretty much the most amazing thing you could eat on the ave.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"You can't get much better bang for your buck than at Tasty Tom's!

We went for breakfast on the new year's holiday. It wasn't too busy, which was nice. I ordered the Canadian omelette and my girlfriend had the two eggs breakfast. 

You really can't get a better deal than what we got. The food was delicious! Everything was cooked fresh to order and the helpings were perfect (which says a lot for me). This will definitely be a place to consider when we're needing a good breakfast or lunch - it should be for you too. :)",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
Above average breakfast.  Omelet was huge and tasty.  Had the chilli omelette. My cousin had the special ad we we were both pleased.,7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"Greasy spoon comfort food done really really well. 'Nuff said? No? Hands down the best Weiner Schnitzel in town: big, crispy, tender served with creamy potato salad. You can only responsibly eat here once every couple of months, even with an active gym membership.",7kko-9WTh53VZ_PmrffrSQ
"I don't think I know anybody who wouldn't like this place. We live in a world that is gogogo all the time so eating healthy is sometime more of an utopia.

Olly Fresco's is da bomb. I only had the chicken and mushroom sandwich but boy, if they can make me such a great grilled panini I can't even imagine how good the rest of the food is. 

I read another post how they remove some options but man, it was my first time in there and they are not lacking options. Same goes for coffee. All sorts of regions and blends.  

If you're sick of the same old teen burger or even any other ""healthy"" fast food, this food fare will make you want to believe again in good food that is fast. 

Next time I'm trying their vegetarian Chili, yes they have the option!",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"A cafeteria of my dreams - so many choices of coffee, cold drinks, sandwiches, prepared salads, treats, and even small portion of nuts and candy - it makes my head spin! There is a buffet of hot foods sold by weight, a sandwich bar for custom cold and pressed sandwiches, daily soups, pasta, and more. I had an egg salad wrap that was absolutely packed and so fresh. I even liked the lettuce, which I normally don't, but it was crisp and doesn't have that weird taste I sometimes notice at other sandwich places. And the prices can't be beat - if you can avoid the lunch rush, the service is reasonably fast.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
This decent sized eatery is located at the bottom of the Alberta health services building and offers both a buffet style service and also other prepared foods made for you at their counter. The prices are my favourite part about Ollys as you can get a decent meal for under 10$ for both breakfast and lunch. While the food is not amazing it is not bad either. Ollys does not pretend to be an upscale eatery and thus relative to expectations it does really well!! Very friendly service and lots of room to sit,7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"Been to Olly's a number of times, they have a nice selection at the buffet which rotates each day. A choice of meats which may be ribs, chicken, beef, or pork and fish. There is a selection of rice, potatoes, and veg. Again they aren't all available each day they change it up, one day may be ribs, the other chicken etc.. They do also have a sandwich and pasta bar that you can order from so you have alot of options. Their is a nice salad bar as well. Hard to walk through and not find anything to eat. You do have a number of healthier options which beats the fast food options of the city center food court. They also have a location on 108st just south of Jasper Ave. I like the place for a work week lunch and the prices are fair.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"As a hospital minion, I can't hide my jealousy that the AHS head office comes with a place like Olly's attached, although I can't say I'm surprised. Compared to the horrid rethermalized slop or fast food served in hospital cafeterias, Olly's offers some fresh, healthy, reasonably priced and made to order foods. Why isn't this offered in the hospital?!? Surely the client base is just as large, if not larger, at UAH or RAH!

Anyhow, although Olly's has recently cut back on some of their selection, they still serve up some tasty and affordable food. If you work in the area and need breakfast or lunch, skip the fast food or the $15+ sandwich and head to Olly's! They have a great selection from a salad bar and hot self-serve (cost based on weight) to made-to-order sammies and ready to go full meals. There's even little containers of snacks and treats, like hummus, chocolates, veggies & dip, chips, jujubes - it's like a combo cafeteria and convenience store. Very helpful for the busy downtown worker, whether it's a meal or just snacks for an informal meeting.

The $2.19 made-to-order breakfast sandwich is an absolute steal given almost all the toppings (except for bacon & cheese) are free, up to 4 selections. Try to get that at Timmy's or Subway! I also love that the food is discounted on Friday afternoon after about 1p.m. My spouse always picks up 2-for-1 soup or entrees for me to take for my weekend night shifts, and my friend who lives on a fixed income finds this is a great way to get some healthy meals that are within his budget. The entrees themselves are easily big enough for two meals - at $8 each and 2 for 1, that's $2 a meal. Wow.

Heck of a deal for homemade food. Plus the head chef is a great guy, so if you like a particular dish, he might just tip you off as to when they will next make it, or make it part of their regular offerings.

We really need this kind of food service in the front lines of healthcare! If the quality of the food that is served to patients was even close to the food they serve at Olly's, patient outcomes would undoubtedly be better. That's some real food for thought.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"Nice little shop in the building. They have fresh veggies, fruit, sandwiches, etc. And lots of coffee on. They also sell kombucha tea.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"Olly's is super close to my office so naturally, I swing by to pick up my coffee at least once week on those days I'm running late and didn't have time to make my own at home! While Olly's is definitely not fine dining by any stretch, but it is a nice option to more on the outskirts of downtown, especially in the winter when you may or may not want to make the trek too far from the office. I like that they have quite the selection of buffet style food as well as some made to order options. If you eat like a bird, the buffet isn't too horribly expensive. If you're looking to beat the lunch rush, try to show up before 11:20, as the line can sometimes get to be a little long! I do find the buffet food can be hit or miss depending on the time of day you are there. Sometimes the food has been sitting out for a while and is dried out. But when it's just been brought out, it's decent. I find the same with the coffee. In the morning, coffee turnover is pretty quick, but if you happen to go in the afternoon, order yourself a latte or one of the made to order drinks as opposed to getting a drip coffee as sometimes the coffee may have neen sitting out for a while and cold or lukewarm.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"The food was so yummy!!! The line up was huge because it was during lunch hour but they had lots of cashier working the till so the line went fast. It was set up like a buffet style. Lots of dishers to choose from. I had rice and some type of curry, potatoes and veggies. My bf had the same. We both got coconut water with our meals. It came up to $22.75 for both meals, which is not too bad. I thought they had really healthy choices which is nice. There is a lot of tables to sit at, and although it was busy, we found a table. It's right down townish so don't expect free parking. 
I will totally be back for sure. It was fast, yummy and good price.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"Some of the food is edible and the prices are fairly reasonable, but the customer service is severely lacking. The cashiers are rude, and some of them struggle with giving you the correct change if you pay in cash. And often they don't even say Hello to you. Instead the first (and sometimes only) words out of their mouth are 'How will you be paying'. 
You also have to watch to make sure they don't turn your styrofoam container with food from the hot buffet upside down when they put the container in a bag.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"Tried Olly Fresco's for the first time today. It's located on 107 Street, in the Alberta Health Services Seventh Street Plaza, ground floor of the South Tower. It's kind of like Sunterra in that it's mostly self serve, though there is a soup (4 different kinds) and sandwich/panini/breakfast counter at the back. Lots of choices for drinks (water, soda, kombucha, etc), snacks (like individually wrapped cheese, $0.85 a piece) and desserts (cookies, candies). A decent-sized salad bar with a variety of leafy greens (all looking fresh) and lots of toppings (chicken breast, deli meat, other vegetables). The hot food self-serve area also has about 10 choices ($1.89/100g) - several meats (today was roast beef au jus, roast chicken legs with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side, butter chicken, and another Indian dish), a fish (I think it was breaded), perogies (with self serve bacon and sour cream... dangerous), and some veggies (steamed broccoli and cauliflower, roasted potato wedges), and I assume there is always a vegetarian dish - today's was lasagna. I may have forgotten about a few other dishes. Everything is labelled and relatively fresh - I saw them replenishing lots of dishes even before it got down to the very end undesirable bits. 

I enjoyed the mishmash I picked up. You use take out styrofoam containers so you can always bring home leftovers. The lasagna was cheesy and flavourful, despite not having any meat in it. The noodles were not as al dente as I would have liked and it was a touch salty, but overall I liked it. The broccoli was perfectly steamed to retain nutrients - still bright green and just a touch of crunch. The roast chicken was really popular - I don't know if it was legs only but I snagged the last piece of thigh in a sea of drumsticks - skin was still kind of crispy and seasoned with some herbs (indistinguishable though). A touch dry but totally edible still. I loved the perogies - they were very generic potato ones, nothing special but not bad (e.g., the right amount of dough and filling, not mushy). I loved being able to choose as much sour cream and bacon bits (real ones!) as I wanted. 

There's quite a bit of seating and a lot of people seem to get the food to go, so I didn't have any trouble finding a spot for two around 12:15pm (it was busy though!). After grabbing a bottle of premium water, my total came to about $13, and I was certainly quite full. You can spend as much or as little as you want to. I thought the food was decent despite it being made for the masses, and I love the variety of choices - I understand that they change offerings daily so I'd be interested to try other options. I think it's a really great option for the people who work on this west end of downtown (note it's closed on weekends). I will be back!",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"This review is solely for the Edmonton City Centre location and based on attitude of both the front line staff and those that sit behind a computer. I took the time to add the business as this particular location was not listed on yelp, I did not want to lump it with another location and it's something I am passionate that I wanted to share my awful experience.

I travel and eat out a lot and tend to bring my own container and utensils and coffee mug to help the environment and reduce wastage something I try to spread along with friends and colleagues. I was drawn to their make your own pasta station, which i had actually gone back to retrieve my own container so I could order one of their pasta when I found out the guy behind the pasta counter, Richard is his name according to the cashier refused to put the pasta in my container stating ""health regulations""
I had no idea it was a thing. I had written to Food inspections Canada and awaiting their response.

I dedicate my lifestyle to reducing waste and try my very best to honour 0 plastic usage.  I appreciate the containers their store offers with biodegradable paper options in their hot and cold stations.

The store also have a special pricing for bring your own cup at the coffee and tea station.

Furthermore, upon taking my bowl of pasta which he insisted slapping on a clear pasta lid I told him no he persisted as he says that's how I have to use to pay? Can't he just hand me a price sticker or just apply it to the side of the bowl?

The attitude and rudeness will ensure I will not visit again.

I also took the time to comment on their website and I got this response (see photo attached)

I get it's in the discretion of business's own rights to do whatever they want, but don't use some sort of health regulation dismiss someone who is trying to save the planet by taking the time to bring in their own containers.

There are so many food & beverage options, with this kind of attitude, this will ensure I nor my colleagues won't be visiting it ever again.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"Finally a food court fresh food experience.  I work at Canada Place and always head to the City Centre Mall for breaks.  To my surprize this little gem was open at 7am..any size tea is only $1.25 !
Olly Fresco's have been providing affordable healthy food for the busy professional.  If your schedule is too hectic to make a quality home-made lunch and you're tired of that same old fast food place, make Olly Fresco's a part of your daily routine.

"Good selection, good prices, but they don't bother to list allergens on their labels (beware coconut in the granola). When I politely called and asked them to label it (as they are required by law, coconut is a tree nut and as such is a priority allergen according to our government) I was met with confrontation and was told ""it behooves you to beware of you own allergens""... a little tough to do when there is no indication on the label... I get that they just opened and I am sympathetic to that but the appropriate response by management is ""sorry, we will make that change right away"" not that its my own fault. *update* went again today and salads with walnuts labelled cashews, management clearly doesnt take your life threatening food allergies seriously. If you have them, just stay away",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"I came here for lunch with my friend and it was well organized, clean and lots of variety to choose from. The front staff were not as organized as I would have liked as there was a line up and some of them were cleaning and putting stuff away.

Other than that it is a great place to grab a quick bite during your work lunch.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"This is my go to food for breakfast and lunch. They have quite a bit of variety in their buffet and is all fresh. They can also cook for you particularly the pasta.

Their price is very reasonable even though they weigh it when you pay. Comparable to Sunterra which is way too expensive and food is horrible, I would recommend to try Olly Fresco. 

The cashier is fast and staff are friendly. I did this review I think Olly deserves 5 stars for me.

Hope Olly Fresco will keep the same quality and new fresh food.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"This restaurant is located in the South Tower of the 7th Street Plaza building. This makes it very accessible from other buildings in the area and accessible via pedway from Centre West. This deli has cafeteria style offering which are sold by weight, as well as cooked to order sandwiches. I rather like getting my container filled with a wide variety of foods for a reasonable price. 

The seating area gets rather busy for lunch but if you arrive earlier or later than noon then it is not quite so busy. Staff are pretty good at bringing out refills of the hot meal items as they are depleted. Pricing is by weight for the salad bar and the hot food bar which is nice. I like the fact that I can always find some items I am in the mood to try! Definitely a quality lunch option. My friends tell me that it is also good for breakfast so perhaps one of these days I shall try it for breakfast as well.",7sak6hzo7YKcgDsngUov1A
"My girlfriend and I ate there last night, the food was cold and the staff was even colder.
Each time our beer was empty we had to call the waitress over for a refill.  The staff didn't seem at all concerned with the patrons, they were more concerned with having fun with each other.  Our waitress made it seem like an inconvenience to check with us on food or drink.
I usually enjoy going to Boston pizza, this is the second time we have been to this location and it will be the last time.
We will still go to bp's but not to the century park lication",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Rating this on my order experience for take out. I have sat in and had food or drinks in the part thus deciding to go with the takeout strategy as my head was hurting already and didn't want to bring on a migraine from a loud environment. However it's been so long since I've been to this location, I didn't realize one needed to walk through the whole restaurant to the back to make your order. Of course you need to be taken back by staff (as you're half in the kitchen if you go that way). I wasn't the only one looking confused as there was another person there to order being led back while I was leaving the space. 

When placing my order with the gift certificate I got checking in at the most previous yelp elite event (thanks BP!), the waitress was polite, knowledgeable about what I could order with the coupon and very honest about how busy it was (as I walked in on Valentine's night). I did find it a bit odd that I wasn't given a number or order receipt but told I'd be given that when I return and to come back in 20 or more minutes. She also didn't take my phone number. Again a bit odd as I know that's pretty standard for takeouts anywhere else. 

I did look out the walk-up door that is specific for takeout orders. I determined with my mobility issues, having to be guided through the restaurant & to the back was better than struggling to get up to the door (and when driving to the gas station, I couldn't tell if that door access would allow parking nearby).

Before I went & burnt time doing random errands close by (bank & gas station are both super close), I stopped at the washroom. It was in need of some maintenance. Not the worst situation I've seen but I would have brought it someone's attention if anyone would have been at the front when I was walking out the main doors. 

Pick up went as smoothly as it could. I came back before the 20 minutes were up and I'm glad I did as it looked like orders were piling up with the amount of receipts on the counter. Before going to the back, I of course needed to wait to get someone to walk me back there (as that's what they instructed me to do when I returned) and then watched them search for my name as there was no receipt number to give them. Lucky for me my cane is memorable? and she knew which pizza was mine when she found it. With them handling a ton of takeout orders and the coziness of the small pick up standing area, I'm a bit puzzled this isn't better organized. I managed to get around the person for skip the dish & through the passageway without my pizza box needing to be tipped vertically or tripping him with my cane (hurray for both of us!). I definitely don't recommend standing in there for an order when there's more than two as that is a small space to try and maneuver past others leaving with orders. 

Pizza was the same tasty great white north I remembered and I really do enjoy the heart pizza being that it's valentine's this week. That really does make a person feel special. I had lots of left overs which was great as this week was a busy one.

In summary, I'll probably continue my once in a blue moon BP locations in/out of the city because of older family member requests. If I'm being honest the restaurant (doesn't matter location) isn't really something I'd enjoy sitting there by myself for a meal. It does the trick when you're travelling and need a quick bite. I'm not a big sports fan nor can I enjoy an alcoholic drink, so I wouldn't enjoy sitting in the lounge in the evenings (which is about the same noise level as a full restaurant) waiting for my order either. As there's other pizza spots for take out without having to walk that far (twice) or worry if I'll actually get what I ordered, I'll probably go else where or just get the pizza delivered to me directly if I really had a craving for a great white north pizza.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"First and foremost, i am a new baby vegan and have not consumed egg or dairy or meat for almost 4 months now. I know, I know, tell me about it. 

I dined here on 07/29/17 and asked my server about vegan options. She went over the menu with me and I decided on a bowl of the Mediterranean Vegetable Bow tie pasta, sans pesto and cheese. It arrived, it was hot and delicious and filling, I paid and left. 

A couple hours later, I ended up feeling quite sick, and I wondered if it could have been something to do with my food, so I googled the nutritional information and found out that my pasta had egg in the pasta noodles, and dairy in the sauce. My waitress lied to me. 

I know it's not that big of a deal, I'm not allergic or anything, but come on. If you're not sure about the menu, ask. 

If I could give 0 stars I would. Never again BPS.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Have been here many times as I have been living in this area for several years. I have always ordered the same food, their pasta jambalaya and was satisfied. Their staff have always been nice, never had any issues with their service, their place is not the most clean, but it's not disgusting either. I am leaving this review based on my recent experience with trying their MVP(?) hamburger. I have to say that was the most disgusting hamburger I have ever had in my life. I would pay that price for McDonald's hamburger anytime, but would not even pay a dollar for that hamburger. It wasn't just tasteless, it had a taste that left me and my friend feeling sick all night. We had the cactus fries on the side and half of those fries were soggy. Based on this experience, I will be staying away from this place for a long while just to get the disgusting taste of that food out of my mouth.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"The waitstaff is friendly enough, but they took my boyfriends drink before he finished, we saw our waitress twice. Someone else had to bring is our food, it was fairly cold, and the second time we saw our waitress it was because she was ushered over by the girl who brought us our food. 

We also had to get another waitress to grab us our bill. Really slow service, go to the Canadian brew house right next door. Way way better service and better food.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Horrible customer service !!! Always wait  15 minutes to receive a hello and/or a menu. Wait another 10 for a drink, and an even longer wait time for the food. Nobody ever checks in to see how were doing, or how the food is. ( and at this point everything is almost finished or cold. ) When we tried to speak to the manager, she ignored us.  Been in the service industry for 6 years. This is not  how you treat customers !!

( Ps- I'm saying this about the pub, the dining room is a whole other story )",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Where to start... $78 for a plate of nachos and a large cheese pizza and a round of drinks, root beer a tea and a couple of chocolate milks for the kids. 
Took about 30-45 minutes to get the pizza, which I could see if the place was busy, but there was only 6 tables seated. Yes I said pizza 1st because that's what came 1st, blazing hot too I may add, 3 out of 4 of us were burnt by the sauce.
 The nachos came about 10 minutes later. Served 3-5 people but comes with a 1/4 cup of salsa and sour cream. When asked for more salsa and sour cream for the table it was added to the bill of course. The nachos were stone cold, drowning in cilantro. I've had better nachos from 7/11 at 3 in the morning. I'm not shocked by this, I never had liked BP's. I have never had good food there, and never will as this last experience was the straw...",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"I have never had any of the problems that the other reviews have talked about. We go to this location all the time, have pretty great service and great food (only one mess up, my pasta was once baked with cheese. No big deal), it's reasonably fast and affordable.  
When we order delivery, yes it does take the full 60 min they say it will but our food is always hot and delicious and the man who delivers knows us pretty well now and is really nice.  
It's a great place to go when I don't want to cook or when it's late post homework and we've got the munchies or just want to play cards.  
Reliable, comforting and predictable.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
Should have read the reviews before I went into here . Went in during supper around 7 pm . Was seated . Watched all the waitresses / waiters serve . We sat there for 20 min not one person came to our table even to give water . We were shocked other staff saw us sitting waitresses walked by our table and nobody came . I wasn't about to chase down staff .. so 20 min sitting at a booth in the restaurant (half full ) nobody acknowledged us . I would have to say that's a first in any restaurant for me . We just got up and left . The guy at the front door cleaning that sat us looked puzzled and I told him we been sitting all this time nobody knows we are in the restaurant not even a hi we will be with you . Never setting foot in this Boston pizza was a joke . Don't go here what a waste of time go to Windermere Boston pizza they actually have style there !,8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"My girlfriend and I ate there last night, the food was cold and the staff was even colder.
Each time our beer was empty we had to call the waitress over for a refill.  The staff didn't seem at all concerned with the patrons, they were more concerned with having fun with each other.  Our waitress made it seem like an inconvenience to check with us on food or drink.
I usually enjoy going to Boston pizza, this is the second time we have been to this location and it will be the last time.
We will still go to bp's but not to the century park lica",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"I feel bad not doing a 5 star review for Boston cause for years and years it was my favorite place to get pizza.  I have never tried this particular location but i found Boston Pizza is usually consistient from restraunt to restraunt.

The pizza I got the other night was very good... but it cost me 32 dollars and imo I got enough pizza for about 3 meals tops.  For 10 dollars per meal it ought to be very good.  

My big beef and the reason I am not doing 5 or 4 stars is the horrible service I got.  I called ahead to have a pizza ready for pickup.  When i got there, they had no order for me.  It wasnt just slow... they had no order at all.

It was supper hour.. they were busy... but i didnt get any sense that they cared about me.  she seemed embarrassed she couldnt find the ticket... but more for herself.  I dont think i heard that they were sorry.  I sure as hell didnt hear any offer of compensation for my time.

I called ahead so i wouldnt have to wait.  then i had to wait.  there was no offer of a drink while i waited.  no offer of a discount.

the pizza was good... the pizza is always good.  It wasnt 32 dollars worth of good though.  I wont be going back for awhile... maybe not at all if royal or fameso do a good job when i try them out sometime later this month.

sorry Boston... good pizza but it will take more then that to keep my business if you insist on charging 32 dollars for a large great white north with italian sausage",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"I pulled over here in winter time, ordered a salad and a pizza and it was freaking delicious!. The service was OK unfortunately there's a lot of screaming families and rowdiness. But the food at this location is really good",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"You can drink here and have appetizers or pizza but i suggest you order entrees elsewhere.  Steak sandwich was overcooked with way too much bread and way too much dressing on Caesar salad. No garnish.   Broccoli soup too creamy.  Washrooms felt dirty.  But staff were pleasant.  We sat in the pub side.  Has a nice sports pub.  I would only return for drinks, maybe salads.  It has tv screens and good street view in pub.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Oh Boston Pizza, how you have been there for me in the past when I have needed a late night snack or am too lazy to make dinner for myself and a pizza saves the day. I do not expect a lot from you really. You are not high end, you cater to a family atmosphere and you are as casual as casual can get. However, when I order a delivery and they say it is going to be 90 minutes I expect that there will no shenanigans with my order.
Maybe it was because my order was small that they did not take it seriously. Only a full order of wings and cheese bread did I want. And after waiting the full 90 minutes for my order the store finally called to let us know that the driver was downstairs. I went down right away to find no one there. Maybe they had gotten the building wrong? We called back to the store and they said that the driver was there, but no one came down so he left on another delivery. Apparently he had also called us several times to let us know he was there. Hmmm I think not. We were so close to cancelling our order, but was assured he would be back in 15 minutes. He was back in 30, just as we were about to call again and cancel our order. The food was surprisingly still warm hence saving this restaurant from a 1 star rating. On my next Boston Pizza craving I will have to find another store. So sad.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Incredibly long wait times for delivery, overpriced, and terrible customer service - I will be crossing this particular Boston Pizza location (Heritage) off my list of regular go-tos for ordering in. 

The last straw was last week when I placed an order, waited over an hour and a half for it to arrive, and then noticed my order was incomplete - I was charged for some items I did not receive. The bill clearly states I was charged for the items. So, I immediately called the location and spoke with a ""manager"" who seemed as if she could care less. Perhaps because my order was small? It doesn't matter, I am a regular customer and at times in the past I have visited the location and the bill was large. Not any more! 

Anyway, she asked me, ""What do you want me to do about it?"". What do I want her to do about it? How should I know what my options are? Why didn't she tell me what she could do about it? I asked for the items to be delivered, but was told it would be ANOTHER hour and a half for it to arrive! No acknowledgement of the mistake being on their end. No apology. And rather rude! As if it was me causing the inconvenience. Disappointed, I told them to forget it. 

The next day I wrote the head offices of Boston Pizza, and was directed back to the restaurant for follow-up within two business days - and, surprise surprise, they never followed up! I have since written the main office back two times telling them this was not followed up and now they don't seem to be responding either. Very disappointing. 

For shame, Boston Pizza, I thought you valued your customers more than that. This location should look at new management, or closing their doors. I certainly will not be visiting them - in person or through delivery - again.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Probably the worst BPs, low quality food and service. They definitely use hot dog water ice cubes.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"This is the worst Boston Pizza in the City.  Everyone knows you go to BP's because you know the menu (no surprises!) the food is pretty consistent and you're usually going to get served fairly quickly and efficiently.  

Walking into this location I noticed immediately that the place was a mess.  There was food all over the floor, tables were not cleared and it just looked *gross*. The waitress sat us down and there was pop on the table and pizza crust on the seat!! What?? So we requested a new table.  The waitress seemed miffed about this but moved us.  We waited forever to be asked if we wanted drinks and that was it, I'd had enough... I rarely, if ever, have walked out of a restaurant... but this was it... we walked out and wrote to BPs about the service never to hear back.  I really don't think this location gives a F888 ?Never going back.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Boyfriend and I went to this location the other day, and I have to say, it wasn't my favourite experience. The waitress was alright - not amazing, but not horrible - she had a bad habit of just leaving us for 20 minutes at a time randomly. 
The food is why I'm giving this place two stars. My boyfriend ordered pasta, and I ordered a chicken sandwich. They give massive portions, which I like, however it seems like they're dead set on drowning every dish they serve. Because my side (Caesar salad) had just /too much/ dressing. My boyfriend's ""pasta"" was more like a stew or a thick soup, there was so much sauce. He was really upset about it, and he's not even the type of person to be picky about food. I offered to bring it up for him to our waitress but he insisted that I just leave it alone. We paid our bill and tipped, then left a little disappointed. Don't think we will be returning to this BPs location again. The quality of food is not as good as some of them I've been to (the Whyte ave location was much better.)",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"I usually come here on late nights with my boyfriend. The pizza is pretty good, but appetizers are average. At night the restaurant is quiet, and service is quick so we'll usually go at like midnight after hanging out with people, and just relax and read the paper together.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Horrible experience with their take out / delivery service. Ordered more than 8 times and not once was the order 100%. 
Similar experience when dining in. Not to mention we got to experience the oh so chipper and happy staff, eager to fix their mistakes and happy to do so! Not. I'm done with Boston pizza I know that they don't need my business but there are so many other better options out there. Haven't been in months and have never looked back :)",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Solid BP location.  

Usually BP is a 3 Star for me but the bar service here made all three of my non-alcoholic quenchers beautifully with fresh fruit just like advertised.  Many BP's I go to do not put in the mango slice or blackberries as pictured. 

Our service was a bit slow but to be fair it was a slammed Friday night. 

The kids love the new stackable crayons and kids' book/menu has a board game fun for the whole family.

My son was disappointed that burgers are no longer on the kids menu.  

The Spicy Memphis Kickin' Chicken was SPICY and so good!

See you soon BP, see you soon!",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"Go back do the dragons den!! This boston pizza should be revamped. Overcooked food, dirty and discussing.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"I have to say that I think this Boston Pizza needs to close down.  There are 2 much nicer and busier locations (South Common and Calgary Trail) pretty close to this one and the 23Ave location is clearly suffering.

I haven't had a very good experience here in years,  It used to be one of my favorite places to go for dinner with my best friend but not any more. 

The food is pretty much the same at all locations but the service varies.  I find that the morale of this store is contagious and it just brings me down because everyone there is so down.  

Instead of checking to see if my food tastes OK, the servers sit and talk to the bartender as if they didn't have any responsibility at all.   

I just get a bad vibe from this place now.  And I have to say - they do not know how to make a decent caesar here.  I always order one hoping someone has finally showed them to do it properly but I'm always disappointed (serves me right for continuing to order them).

I would recommend the Calgary Trail Boston Pizza if you're looking for a good BPs.",8p9TNDj2r-rf1pPmBSc5wQ
"This place offers a very simple yet diverse menu. For example, they offer poutine three different ways including Butter Chicken. They offer three burgers, each one with its own cultural style. I went for the Ethiopian style Lemlem Burger which includes a hot sauce and peppers. It tasted fantastic and the prices are fantastic to match. If you are looking soup, sandwiches, fries, breakfast or burgers, they are worth a visit.",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
Super friendly and attentive duo run this adorable and funky throwback to old Beverly history. Well made basics done from scratch. Several vegetarian and vegan options but small menu done right. Can't wait for the expanded restaurant and their homemade ice cream treats.,9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"Went here this morning for breakfast.  My husband had $14 french toast with fruit on top and coffee, I had $14 coffee, some how when we were the only two people there the cook or the waiter, more like both, FORGOT about me after they told me what I originally ordered wasnt available.  So a $14 cup of shitty coffee, that was my breakfast.  We eat out 10 times a week, we will NEVER return here.    Sadly there is no negative rating available.",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"We came by for a breakfast and coffee, it was pleasant inside and we were so surprised!  This gem is located in a not-so-rich area of town so we weren't sure what to expect, but the ratings were so good, but now I know why! The lady who runs it is very friendly and the food is delicious, but what really got us was the attention to detail of the d√©cor. She didn't miss a thing, there were even cushions in the bench nook! It was super clean and relaxing and quite a REFRESHING change from the normal trendy type of caf√©, much quieter and the music was excellent. 

RECOMMENDED!",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"Such a cute, cozy space. We really love the way it's been decorated. The couple that own and run it are very nice people and the service was really good. The menu has a nice variety and very reasonable prices. I had the Lemlem burger which is covered in a spice that comes only from Ethiopia. Nice and spicy! The only suggestion we would have is the way the food was presented. Maybe a piece of fruit or raw vegetables on the plate. Other than that, we liked it.",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"I am pleased that I am the first Yelper to review this little gem. This tiny little caf√© is a great place to have a cup of tea and grab some fresh lunch at a reasonable price. It is very quaint inside full of antiques that are reminiscent to past days in old Beverly. Lots of sweet antiques and warm wood furniture grace the restaurant. They also have a small area dedicated to selling local business products which I appreciated. A small but diverse lunch menu - burgers, sandwiches, and a variety of poutines. My husband ordered the Flying Dutch Burger with fresh fries while I ordered the Black Bean Burger with fries and started out with a bowl of home made soup. The soup of the day was ham cheese chowder and it was delicious. I could have easily had another bowl. Thick and flavourful swimming with chunks of ham and potato, I would love to come in daily to see what the daily soup offering is. And both burgers were delicious. Homemade patties, lovely spices, and a soft homemade toasted bun. My Black bean patty was spicy and my husbands were more mild, but both were equally delicious. And the French fries  are freshly cut and crisp and hot out of the fryer.  The server was extremely friendly and helpful and the cook came out to see if we enjoyed everything. While we were there, we struck up a conversation with the table next us and had an enjoyable time. I think this is exactly what Beverly needs. Please go and enjoy! The cook talked about expanding the restaurant and serving ice cream and funnel cakes which I really hope they do. The best of luck for them. I definitely will be back!",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
Went here again with  a friend I had the veggie burger. It was good but I found the patty to be a little mushy. Soup was amazing,9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"Popped in for lunch & what a little gem on 118! This cozy spot feels rustic & comfortable (a Little House on the Prairie meets coffee shop/book nook vibe. A small menu with a few surprising choices (daily breakfast until noon, burgers, sandwiches, hotdogs, bowls, etc) Prices are reasonable for the size of the portions - *funny how something could look small but really, it's the same portion size of the item if I'd make it at home, so I don't know why I think it's small??

The burger menu sounded interesting so we had a bacon cheeseburger and a lettuce wrapped lemlem burger (spicy Ethiopian patty) Both were $8 + $6 to add a side and pop. The lemlem was delicious!! Soooo flavourful, very spicy, definitely something new-to-me and I loved it. The rest of the food was good, the soup a homemade tomato bacon with dollops of creamy cheese? Sour cream? 

A very cute spot and I'm curious to try their German-style burger and a poutine next time. Also vegan/vegetarian options on menu.  I also saw on they completed renos on their expansion and will double in space.",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"So awesome.  What a wonderful little cafe in Beverly, everything about this place is fantastic.  The decor is done up in an old western pioneer style and feels very rustic.  The owner is so friendly and often times is running the place solo taking orders, cooking, serving, etc and we never have to wait very long. 

I usually get the Lemlem burger made with Ethiopian spices and it is truly fantastic.  

This place is such a hidden gem.",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"This is a great spot, delicious food, great atmosphere, friendly service, and good prices. A very welcome addition to the Beverly area!",9Udgv_7h8oj6NXq5hQeJow
"First time to order from here and we were not disappointed. We ordered Sam's House Special pizza, zucchini sticks and chocolate pie. Ordered in the early evening and had our food delivered in less than an hour. Small portion with the zucchini sticks but they were hot and delicious. The chocolate pie was delivered half frozen and wasn't that great but everything else was really good. Pizza had lots of meat/toppings on it. Nice and thick with the toppings, just the right amount of tangy sauce and a good crispy crust. Order came with four cans of pop since it was over $30. Will definitely be ordering from here again!",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"We had never heard of this place and found them listed on the Skip the Dishes site.  Also, our first visit there.  We were actually looking for a free delivery place but the prices at Sam's seemed so reasonable that we didn't mind paying for the delivery.  The food came quick.  We ordered the super donairs with cheese and they were massive.  And very tasty.  My son had the cheeseburger and fries and it was also a generous size and he gave it the two thumbs up.  Will definitely order there again.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"My #1 place to order out when I get the munchies. The placed is under different management and its run Much better. Free delivery,  order just needs to be over 15$. Tons of choices with their menu. Free pop if your order is over 28, if I recall correctly. No complaints.  Top notch service.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"We have been ordering food from this location for a few years since moving into a nearby neighbourhood. They became our go-to place for pizza orders. Top quality, fresh and more than reasonable prices. Donair is also great, just a touch too spicy for us though. Highly recommended.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
A local gem. Sams has really great food for a really great price . a place that we've gone too at times when we eat out Or get delivered through skip the dishes That we enjoy and really get a Bang for our buck. Highly recommended.,ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"I ordered from here because they're on a number of the online ordering websites (Just Eat and Skip the Dishes) and I'd been thinking of ordering from them for a while. The free delivery was a perk since it seems many places don't offer free delivery anymore.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings. The pizza was not greasy and the crust wasn't doughy, and there was a good amount of toppings on it. It wasn't a huge pizza, but it seemed like a good enough value for the price. Perhaps the only thing I would have changed is that I think I'd have liked it with a bit more sauce on it. I also got a Caesar salad. For the two items it came out to about $20, which was enough to feed two people. 

I can honestly say that I would order from Sam's again. I like that the pizza wasn't too heavy or greasy like some pizzas can be. And it arrived at my home relatively fast (I think it was only about 30 minutes).",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"Choices was limited since it was late - so we got a Beef Donair with Cheese and some fries from Sam's just before midnight. I wasn't impressed as the Donair failed to have that pleasant flavour in a beef donair. Not sure what but something about the donair seemed off or maybe it's just different. Let's just say - I had better from a different takeaway with the same beef donair with cheese but better. Definitely better. 

Though, I must say free delivery for an order worth $15 or over is a bonus nonetheless but food wise - unfortunately I won't be back for more. It seemed like it's either a hit or miss with Donairs.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
So we've lived in the neighbourhood & it has never had a good pizza and donair shop. Well ordered a pizza and wow. Looks like a father and son run it. They pushed the kitchen to the back and have lots of seats but all of them were full. That's a great sign. Well some of the best pizza I have ever had. Be ordering again. Please give them your support next time you are hungry.,ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"I've seen this business pop up on various food ordering apps and thought we'd give it a try. It's not far, so to save the delivery fee and driver tip, we ordered for pick up. The man answering the phone was a bit difficult to understand both because of a thick accent and a loud fan on his end, but I asked if there was a special with pizza and wings. We ordered the ""pick 3"" that includes a medium 2 topping pizza, 10 wings and a poutine. We also added a 3 piece of fried chicken (comes with fries) and were given 4 free cans of pop. Total came to just under $34. 

Pizza was simple but had a good crust and decent sauce. Wings were not breaded but fried crispy. Poutine was ok, and could have used more cheese. Fried chicken was a pleasant surprise - seasoned well and crispy without being oily. Didn't love that it came in a greasy paper bag though.

The place itself is small and in an older plaza. I'm not sure I'd get anything ""fancy"" here, but the basics were ok. Didn't blow me away, but I didn't hate it either.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"Wowwww!!!!! Amazing!!!! 
We ordered the lasagna, spaghetti and meat balls and French fries. All of that with deliver was under $20!!!! 
The delivery was fast, customer service was friendly, the amount of food you get is massive. My husband and I are so impressed with our meals. Highly highly recommend this restaurant",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
Had them twice now. Really enjoyed the pizza. Definitely found our new pizza joint!!! I would for sure 100% recommend them!!!,ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
Great prices best pizza I have ever had delivery was fast food hot I highly recommend Sams,ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"Excellent food, they are always fresh and really know how to put cheese on a pizza. I've been eating here for years. Great people too. One time my debit wasn't working and they gave me the food on spot. Real good people here.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"So i felt like loading up my system with fast food the other day so i went into Sam's for the first time to try his $32  4 item special.
It's a homey little place with a few tables and a giant menu above the order desk.
I order the double cheeseburger with free fries,10 hot chicken wings ,a 10 inch pepperoni/salami pizza and a large onion rings.
It comes with a 2 l bottle of pop or some canned pop.
Good fast service from the 2 staff that were working.
As for the food itself the pizza was very good ,the kind i like with good quality greasy melted cheese over the 2 meats which were also quality.
Pizza was very good especially for the price.
The double cheeseburger was thick with good, filling patties and a nice bun.
The fries were plentiful with a nice deep fried look and taste.Not pale and under cooked like so many other places. 
The chicken wings were a bit underwhelming as they were quite small but they were cooked well and had some nice heat.
The onion rings were good as well as indeed being a large amount.
All around good deal.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"The missus and I are avid fans of Sam's. The prices are very reasonable and we have not been disappointed yet.  The donairs are decent for late-night eats (however, more veggies on them would be a good thing), and the onion rings are always a classic.  When you order a pizza from these folks, I hope you don't mind cheese... Because you get an absolute pile of it!  I remember getting a flyer in the mail a couple of years ago from them and it said ""we guarantee extra cheese!""  

They weren't lying.

Free delivery over 18 bucks is also a bonus and gives them a 1-up against other late night options like Domino's or Pizza 73.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"We've ordered a few times from Sam's.  The last time was directly calling them rather than using a third party food delivery as they offer free delivery over $18.  I called at 6PM and it took an hour for the food to arrive but it was hot when arrived.  You can't pay credit card over the phone but the driver had his machine ready to go for tapping.

They have specials listed on their website and we ordered #4, 2 super cheese donairs, large fries and 2 cans of pop for $21.95.  I also had an order of zucchini sticks with ranch sauce for $5.50.  It was a lot of food.  The zucchini sticks were hot and crispy.  The donair were loaded with lots of meat but not so much lettuce or tomato and I had enough for 3 meals!  They also gave lots of fries that we couldn't finish them in one sitting.

Food is priced well and if we don't want to wait an hour, would call earlier or pick up.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"Visiting here from Vancouver BC, Sam's pizza and Donair,has some amazing reviews. The pizza and wings I ordered were absolutely delicious. Great customer service, and fast delivery. I'am very impressed, definitely will be ordering from here again.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"I called in and ordered for delivery. Pizza came faster than expected and was so delicious!! My kids said it was the best they'd had.

The Sam's favorite was so good!",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"We must all have different dining experiences and expectations. I guess I didn't know what to expect until I walked in. Sam's Pizza is in a small strip mall and the place itself is a bit tiny. There were plenty of little tables and the place was empty. The decor could use a bit of a makeover and can be cleaner. The table we sat at had residue from a previous diner with crumbs on the seat.

OK, now on with the food. 

Ordered a medium Sam's House Special pizza since I guessed it may be one of their signature pizzas. The intent here was to take the extras back for an on the road lunch tomorrow. The crust couldn't have been from fresh dough and it seemed like it came out of a package. It was thin and not crispy. The toppings were ok but a bit sparse. Sauce? It definitely needed more sauce with some taste. The overall taste experience? Well with the thin crust and the sparse tasteless sauce it was a bit of a disappointment.

Also ordered a caesar salad comprised of chopped romaine tossed with a ceasar dressing from Costco topped with croutons and dry parmesan cheese out of one of those green containers. One can't mess up a salad but dry parmesan rather than grated fresh parmesan is a bit of a stretch.

They also served two thick slices of buttered (possibly with garlic salt) along with the meal. That part didn't make sense since we were having pizza and a salad but graciously accepted.  

Although this is an independent business, the place and the food could use a good makeover.  Rather unimpressed but hope things will get better.",ASJH8IDBdX_f5yOX0XEfYA
"Best place for a steak sandwich, hands down! This place can get pretty busy, but if you come on a non-oilers night or early, you should be fine.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"We went here yesterday before the last Oilers home game of the 2009/2010 season. The place was packed, as we expected, but there was only one couple in front of us, so we were hopeful.

The hostess told us that we could be sat right away, but we would have to sit with another couple that would be coming later. I asked how long we would have to wait if we didn't want to share  table and she bluntly said ""7"" (the game started at 7:30).

I was hesitant but agreed, and was not happy about it. We got  to our table and sat down. I really couldn't believe that they would cram people in to the point of sharing tables with other strangers just for an extra couple of bucks. I was really peeved by this. No one was at the table, but every time a hostess walked by with 2 people, I thought - oh crap. No one ever came to join our table, but the fact that we were even asked ""just in case"" showed me how money hungry this business was.

We ordered and our food took forever! I guess that is to be expected because the place was packed, but it was over 20 minutes for a medium steak sandwich and a half vegetarian loaf. Our food finally arrived, and Ryan's pathetic little steak, potato and garlic bread was sure a rip off for $18.00. He was so disappointed when he cut into his steak and it was well done. I enjoyed my food, but it was nothing special really.

We left feeling neglected as customers and disappointed as food lovers. We will go back, hoping that it was maybe an off night, but the nostalgia of this place has truly changed for me.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"This is a really busy place on game nights so don't be surprised when you have to wait in a long line up. That being said it is worth the wait.

The only thing I tried here was the pizza and it was delicious. It was crispy but not crunchy and the toppings were fresh. I can't really say anything bad about this place other than the long wait but that's just a testament to how good it is.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I've been here twice . first time was for my birthday. i had a steak and lobster . I wanted my steak cooked med- rare. it came medium-well . they cooked me another it came out the same .. I didn't eat it . my lobster was so rubbery and tasted like leather. I could not chew it. they reinburst my meal.. I left unhappy and hungry. Second time a friend was taking me out to try their pizza . We ordered the house special pizza. Restaurant wasn't busy.... 
The pizza took 40 minutes to arrive. Service was terrible. Server was rude.We had no preset for our pizza.We had to beg for a napkins. Did not have pizza tongs . pizza came out on a hot plate and we are suppose to use our hands .. and have to beg for napkins?!! Crust and ingredients were very good. except it was sitting too long and became wet. did not take home left overs. server never asked if we liked the pizza. my friends and I left unwanted . upset. hungry . ruined our day. felt very unwelcomed.hostess asked us if we enjoyed our meal. I said No . she asked if I informed the server. I said I did and she ignored me. Waitress was extremely snobby. Very dirty floors in restaurant.I will never go back. should have learned the first time. good luck",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"This is our favourite steak house in town.  A very casual place with fabulous steaks, always perfectly cooked, and all the sides are great.  Their mushrooms are fab (only time hubs eats mushrooms).   I've heard the pizzas are great, but we come for the beef.  Another great dish is the beef ribs (I call them Brontosaurus bones).   They are amazing and when you get the platter you'll wonder how you'll ever eat it all.  They serve the best lobster tail I've ever had.  It's a casual, very busy place, and the wait staff just flies. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Coliseum Steak & Pizza is my favourite steak house in Edmonton. They also make a mean pizza, but its the steaks that make it worthwhile.

While the location and the exterior of the building might make you weary -- as many of my friends were when they saw that I had made a reservation for my fiancees birthday party -- don't let that fool you. This place has some of the best food in the city and they've got decades of experience in the business. Apparently, one of their cooks has been grilling steaks in their kitchen for 40 years! He definitely knows how to cook a perfect steak.

The prices are good, the food is outstanding (though, I'm pretty sure the soup comes from a can), and the staff are friendly. The old school charm of Coliseum makes it so that you feel like family, even if it is your first time in the restaurant.

Despite my glowing review, I'd probably give only 4.5 stars if we could give half-ratings on Yelp. While most of the food is great, I'm pretty sure that the soup is canned and the pizza, while good, is certainly not the best in town. But, these are minor issues and so I'm rounding up and giving Coliseum Steak & Pizza a full 5 stars.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"My steak was properly prepared, my soup was only acceptable, and my spaghetti with meat sauce was pretty bad.  My server was pleasant, but the dining space was a bit dingy.  I'm happy to have tried this place out, but I don't think that I'll return any time soon.

Four stars?  Five stars?!?  I don't understand the bases upon which some users of this site base their reviews.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"A few co-workers have raved about this restaurant and there were a lot of strongly positive reviews for it online, so I was excited to try it. After experiencing it for myself, the only reason I can guess why certain people like it so much, is because none of them ever cook for themselves. If that's the case, then this restaurant makes sense. But if you're the kind of person who likes to eat out so they can try foods they normally wouldn't or couldn't make at home (like me), then I'd say it's best to skip this place. 

I had a steak, which came with fries or baked potato, salad or soup and garlic bread. I went with the fries and salad options. The reviews that declare that this place makes the 'best fries ever' baffles me, since they're the kind of fries you can find anywhere. Pretty standard, nothing special. The salad was a tiny plate of mostly iceberg lettuce, that could've come from a ready-mix bag. The steak was ok, but quite small. I asked for it medium-rare and it was cooked that way, but the meat was a bit tough. I've definitely made better steaks myself at home. My friend ordered the Chicken Greek Salad which was a giant plate of iceberg lettuce (again, very similar to the ready-mix kind you buy in large bags at the grocery store) with a couple of olives thrown in and some diced chicken fingers on top. 

As for the ""great service"", again, I'll have to agree to disagree. The waitress repeatedly reached across me without apologizing or saying 'excuse me'. We were never once offered refills or our drinks and only managed to finagle a pitcher of water when she came back to give us our bills. She came across as very impatient and seemed annoyed when I asked what the soup options were.

All in all, I felt like the food was the equivalent of what any amateur could accomplish with a quick run to the grocery store - for twice the price, plus tip. If your fridge has only ever contained beer and hot sauce, this is a good place to go for a quick and simple, if over-priced meal. If you're looking for something a little more exciting that's worth dishing out your hard earned money for, I'd recommend exploring other options.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Old school dining at its finest - from decor to menu offerings, this is a throwback to the 70's/80's. That said, I quite enjoyed myself here. The food isn't fancy - which is a funny thing to say about a steakhouse - but it's hearty and wholesome. The menu is a nostalgic reminder of the ridiculousness of the past (ex. The appetizer combo for 2 had a million things on it...including a RACK OF RIBS! Whaaa? Who starts with that?? Not going to lie. We were so very tempted.) 

Tried a steak and it was heavily seasoned with a good amount of fat on it. Yum!! Came with a starter salad (we went with clam chowder for an extra charge), a heavily buttered piece of garlic bread (tasted like it was buttered, toasted, and then drenched in margarine. Basically, amazing.) and a baked potato. A server comes to the table with all the condiments (butter, sour cream, bacon, chives) and loads you up. Fun!

Also tried their signature pizza and it was also pretty good. Crispy bottom but a bit soggy towards the middle, and loaded with toppings. Not the best pizza in town, but it was decent.

Definitely a place with an older clientele or larger families. Also, lots of EPS officers the night we were there. Quick service, hearty portions and reasonable prices. I dig it!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I've been here three times in the last four months, after having heard rave reviews about their pizza.

The first time we had a pepperoni and ham pizza, which is decent, but not great. The cheese is plentiful but the pepperoni reminds me of the cheap Superstore variety. Also, the crust is a bit too wholesome-tasting, almost like whole wheat bread.

The second time we had the ribs and a steak sandwich. The steak sandwich was delicious but the ribs were horrible.

The third time we had a 12 oz New York strip, a medium pizza, and battered cod with fries. The strip was very good, the pizza OK, and the cod pretty good. On the downside, the french fries are thick steak fries that don't have the same crispness and flavor as do the thinly cut fries that you see served more often these days.

Bottom line: If you're in the area for an Oilers game, come here for the steak, maybe a pizza if you're craving for it, but don't make a special trip to this restaurant.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I've been eyeing this place up for quite awhile now, every time I drive past I wondered about it. 
We had a lovely server and we were a bit pinched for time but at 8pm on a a Thursday there was plenty of open seating and the service was incredibly fast! 
We ordered the ribs and shrimp as well as the calamari salad. The salad was super neat with a Greek salad and calamari with tasty taziki! And the portion was great! 
The ribs came out way faster than we anticipated but they were very good and interestingly it came with some cut up bread instead of fries. Prices were about average for what I would expect and the menu would be a good fit for a family dinner out kind of place.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Awesome combo of food and value for dollar! Two of us had the 7 oz new york steak special for $23.95 includes soup or salad, baked potato or fries, pan fried mushrooms, and garlic toast. Steaks were perfectly done, these people are steak professionals old school style. The steaks sliced like melted butter...our other companion had the ribs. He raved as they fell apart dripping with flavor. The garnishes for the baked potatoes are 70s style served as you like it from the silver serving dish; as much butter, sour cream, bacon bits and fresh crispy green onion as you like. The service is warm, attentive, and as if you are a regular even if you're not. We've been here before, we don't go often and now we wonder why... an added tidbit of info. Edmonton was recently listed as #8 for best pizza in THE WORLD. This place was listed as one of the pizza places worthy of special mention for Edmonton making the list.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Well we walked in at 9:10 and they close at 9:30. We were told we had to order ASAP because the kitchen will close right away. At first the staff seems annoyed but we hurried and order within 10 seconds. They became very accommodating. 

We had the coliseum pizza special and a top sirloin medium rare with fries. The food came out fast but looked and tasted good. The pizza was stacked high with toppings and lots of cheese. The steak was huge and cooked to perfection. The only fault was the steak needed to rest but obviously the chef was in a rush so he didn't do that. So when we cut into the steak it bled out. Not a biggie. For the size of the portions the price was great. You couldn't get a steak that size at the Keg for that price. 


Biggest downfall was, there was only two tables left and we were still eating, the waitress decided to turn off all the lights, music and televisions. Only lights were left on were the dining room which made it dark and awkward with no background music. Yes we get ...you are closing. Sorry but the restaurant is open till 10pm. The kitchen closes at 9:30. I think you should still leave the ""ambience"" on. 

I gave 4 stars due to the fact the food was good and the price was great. I will return but probably at 7pm!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Well,  I come in with my family on St.Pattys and ask for a Irish Car Bomb and the waitress just said no? 
I'm sorry. What do you mean no?
No you don't know what the most popular drink on St.Pattys day is? 
Or no you don't want to make it? 

I won't be back here.  The bartender/waitress is just miserable!    Just quit!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Easy atmosphere. Dinner before a concert or even a hockey game and this is your place to be.

Convenient location. Solid food with decent portions. I liked what I ordered and there were no complaints from around the table. They take reservations which is good if you know you have limited time and can't wait. The server was attentive. 

I will definitely be back again.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"We were excited to try this resteraunt because of some good reviews, so we ordered a starter which was delicious but the main course was brought to us half way through the appetizer so we couldn't enjoy the full starter. The main course was put in the table and the server shoved out starter out of the way. I then told the server we weren't ready for the starter yet to which we received the statement ""what do you want me to do about it"" by the waiter. The waiter had not checked to see how the food was but occasionally looked over to see if we were done yet and it felt like we were rushed to get out. When the bill came the waiter dropped it off and told us to pay at the front then walked away.  There were three staff / personnel on shift at the register who asked us how the meal was and we told them the food was good but the service was lacking. Their reply was have a nice night. I would not recommend you go to this place for the service alone. It is unfortunate because it had high potential of being a good resteraunt but it is all lost in the poor service and the menu which was lacking.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I used to come here all the time as a kid and teenager before concerts and oilers games. It was always packed, but I imagine it has died down a lot since the arena moved. We decided to come here for dinner while I was visiting home, and I'm so glad we did. The decor is extremely dated and it was pretty empty when we went, but the steak was so good. We all got t-bones with fries and garlic toast. The steak was surprisingly extremely good. The fries could use some more seasoning, but overall I was so pleased. I definitely want to go back next time we're in Edmonton!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
Went for lunch with a friend. Seated promptly then ignored. When the server finally came over we asked if we could order and she said no I have people ahead of you to order.  Who does that ? Its lunchtime and people are on a schedule. Food was mediocre at best. Don't really see the appeal.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
I love the ceaser salad and the garlic ribs. They are always perfect.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
Best pizza in Edmonton by far. Their lobster is fresh and delicious. Their pasta could be a little thinner but still good.. Their fish and chips are about $4 a fillet pretty decent margins it's almost cheaper to buy from them and and have them cook them than to cook at home,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Their pizzas are amazing.
Perfectly tangy pizza sauce, crispy in just the right way... about 15-18 dollars a pizza but you do not leave feeling unsatisfied.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Finally tried the legendary Coliseum Steak & Pizza.   Word is, the Great One drops by if he's in Edmonton.   It was a hangout for the 80s Oilers - before hockey players went into tax brackets the rest of us can only dream of.  Lots of pictures on the wall.

Went for the special:  NY Steak with mushrooms, garlic bread, choice of potato and choice of soup or salad.   Salad was bog standard, basically lettuce but the blue cheese dressing helped a great deal.   Steak?   Outstanding!   As good as it gets IMO.   Garlic bread was tasty too.   Mushrooms were tasty with just the right amount of seasoning.   It was steak fries, which aren't my favourite.  Prefer French fries but they were done the way they should be.   Highly recommend this place!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Not bad for a dive bar, but I don't think I'll be back. The food we had was good, but the menu is limited if you want to consume anything healthy. This is all carbs and fat in monster portions -- good luck even getting a salad that isn't the maximum number of calories possible to dump on lettuce. If you're gluten-free or vegetarian, you can't eat here. All that said, my souvlaki was delicious and everyone at my table enjoyed their plates as well. Service was kind of short and curt with us, even though we had made a reservation and warned them we'd be a big group. The restaurant wasn't busy when we were there, so there was no reason to rush us through our orders. Regardless, decent food. If you want a steak sandwich & fries, definitely come here, but if you want anything else, stay away.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"We decided to try this place out on a Friday night on a whim. I had been here a few years ago and had a nice lunch with a friend. Fast forward  2 years..it was time to bring ""E"" here to show her what an old fashioned steak house is like!

We went at about 6:30pm and the parking lot was full. We were worried it would be too busy to get a table, but upon entering we were cheerily greeted and seated immediately. The place was packed but there were a few empty tables.

Busy restaurants are good, and bad. Busy is good because the food gets turned over quickly, thus it is more fresh. Busy is bad because service usually suffers as a result. But not here!

The waitress came immediately to take our drink orders. Very impressed. She was friendly, and ""on"". No waiting, no delays, no looking around wondering if anyone noticed we had been seated. 

We started with the calamari, which was actually very good. It was buttery tender, had a nice dipping sauce and was topped with peppers and green onion. It was actually one of the better versions we have had. The batter was light and crispy. Staying with the ""fast service"" theme, the appetizer came within minutes. But quality was not sacrificed due to speed. It was perfectly cooked.

""E"" ordered a shrimp entree that came with an average salad (seemed bagged, tsk tsk) a good ole' fashioned baked potato, and of course the battered shrimp and dip which she claimed to be excellent.

""D"" ordered that t-bone steak, salad (bagged!), baked potato (perfect!) and a fairly good t-bone. It was perfectly cooked and from past experience these folks know how to cook a steak properly. My only complaint is that it was a tad tough in spots but it was not a deal breaker as in general, it was very tasty, and cooked by someone who knows what they are doing. (Chop, maybe hire some of the cooks from this place?). The steak was seasoned perfectly, not over-seasoned as to mask the taste of the meat. Well done, chef(s)!

Our mains came lightning fast, and the guy who garnishes the potatoes came shortly after to top them off. Nice touch...I like the old school way of doing potatoes, not having to ordered ""loaded"" ones as the newer places seem to do.

Both entrees came with garlic toast, too.

The bill came as fast as everything else, which was great. I really have a problem with the ""good service, wait 15  minutes for the bill"" epidemic when it comes to most places.  Our waitress was suitably rewarded for her excellent and professional service.

Our meal came to about $65 including two soda's and it was money well spent. The steak could have been a bit less grissly (sp) but when you get service this good, one tends to overlook things like that. 

Service was extremely fast, but you never felt rushed. These people have this gig down-pat, and could school a lot of the more expensive steak houses on service and quality. 

We look forward to going back and trying some of the other types of steaks they offer, and even the delicious lobster that a lot of people were ordering. Thanks for an AWESOME experience!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"If you want to go old school throw back to 1984 steak and pizza...this is your place. 

The decor of this joint hasn't changed one bit, old wood trim, those kinda beige leather chairs, and even a few team pics of the Oilers from the glory days of the 80's. 

The food is actually really good, and reasonably priced compared to most other ""steakhouses"" in the city. I ordered the beef ribs while the gf had to try a shrimp and mushroom pizza. The ribs show up and I knew it was going to be a sight...basically a Flintstone sized plate of cow and bone with fries and garlic bread. My lady looked frightened...the ribs were very flavourful and by the time I was done, I swore off food for 24 hours. Her pizza was delish as well, pretty typical pie for a place such as this, definitely homemade sauce and lots of toppings.

Sometimes on a cold night you just want the comfort of a rustic place that will feed you right. This is the best spot in town for that kinda dinner. Fine dining it isn't, but sometimes you just need a steak and a beer... 

Oh did I mention it was packed...usually a good sign, especially with no arena next door to bolster sales on a game night. This did create some pretty suspect service though, tough to get a second drink etc. I felt like our server was a bit burnt out just going through the motions.

Hope this place never changes, despite what people say about the dated decor and menu, sometimes a travel back in time ain't so bad.

3 1/2 stars

Cheers 

Andy",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Honestly... I was very surprised. I had no idea what I was in for because of the area in town. But it was pretty great! It had a nice family ambiance and was surprisingly busy! I tried the ""vegetarian loaf"" which is actually a sandwich... That was a bit strange. Otherwise though it was good.

Our server was awesome. I has a long Island iced tea which was pretty darn good. I would actually come back here! My partner had steak and he loved it. :) definitely was pleasantly surprised.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I have been enjoying my favorite steak sandwich for many years at Coliseum Pizza & Steak.  The staff are very loyal and have been in the business for over 30 some years.  My steak is always cooked to perfection.  Large portion of fries and fresh fried mushrooms to compliment the steak are amazing. The d√©cor is really really outdated as well as the serving dishes are right out of the 70's, wooden salad bowl, oil & vinegar condiments and salt & pepper shakers are filthy. They have not changed the menu in 40 years but that's the reason the food remains constant.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I have eaten here a few times and had a number of different menu items. Regardless of the food ordered, the service is always good, and the staff pleasant.

The food, however seems to just miss the mark every time.
The dry ribs appetizer is good. The rib special is abgood deal, but the ribs are low quality meat and the sauce little more than ketchup. (Being fan of ribs, I have had them twice and both times they were disappointing.)

Tonight I had a T-bone steak. The steak was well cooked to the medium side of what I asked (med rare). The first bite was ok but after that it went down hill, as all I could taste was salt. Not steak spice or even seasoning salt, but the steak was salted heavily.

The sole redeeming grace in my visits here so far is the pizza. Its a deep dish with a thick crust and not a bad amount of toppings and cheese.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"We were visiting from out of town when a friend drove us to CPS for lunch. We all had steak sandwiches which we understand is their ""known for"".  Food was great and was only surpassed by the friendly service.
Will go again when next in Edmonton.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww

"This place is a pre-game tradition for many hockey fans.  The steaks are charred on a grill, the baked  potatoes come wrapped in foil and the fixins come in that trio of stainless steel dishes.  So order up a big slab of beef, get the side order of mushrooms, a beer at a third of the price of the rink and pretend the Oilers are still a championship team.
 
Pizza is OK too.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww

"Haven't been here for awhile.  Every time I go I am reminded how much I love it. Consistent menu, good service, lots of parking, old school decor and most importantly great steaks cooked to perfection. I enjoy the simple
Baked potato and how the garnishes come in a little tray doled out by the server.  The garlic toast is fresh and buttery, served hot and crunchy.  For me, Coliseum holds its own against any steakhouse in YEG.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
A great place to go for a decent steak or a hearty pizza. Very down to earth and friendly.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww

"Came here when I was a kid a few times.  Haven't been here since.  I'm now 50+ Had a New York steak and it was cooked perfectly. 

Best steak I've not had a steak this good in quite a while. Service was excellent.  If I HAD to pick on something, it would be the baked potato. It wasn't hot enough to melt the butter.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Great steaks! The flavour of their beef is wonderful and not duplicated anywhere else. Always popular, efficient service and the Caesar salad sure isn't lacking of dressing!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
Ordered the steak with baked potato with mushrooms on the steak. Was fantastic. The only complaint I have is the salad was wet. Fix this and I will give full stars. Waitress was attentive and friendly. Went away full.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"This pizza and steak joint has been around since the early 80's.. the decor hasnt changed much, so it's like stepping back in time. Service is super friendly and place has an ambiance that's warm and inviting. They had a New York steak special tonight with buttered mushrooms which came out nicely seasoned and comparable in execution to high end steakhouses. I swapped out the side of fries/baked potato with spaghetti and homemade meat sauce for my toddler who made quick of messy work of it lol! Thr side of clam chowder was tasty and had a good handful of clams in it. We also went with the Coliseum special pizza (added pineapple for the toddler) which was a nice thick crust pizza  loaded with toppings. Its solid tasty fare and combined with the friendly staff, it's easy to see why this place has been around for 40years.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I'm surprised I've never heard of this place until recently. However location is not ideal for me since I live on the other side of the city. This place offers cozy comfort food for a reasonable price. The portions are big and food was delicious. I ordered the house special steak with mushrooms on top. For around $26, it came with steak grilled to your liking, pasta, salad and garlic toast. I was so full afterwards and it was a very satisfying meal. This is a great place to go if you're hungry and want a good old fashioned hearty meal.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
Our favorite restaurant--service is fantastic. Very friendly and deal with any concerns right away. Quality of food is 5-Star. BEST STEAK in Edmonton!,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"The food is always good here.  Have yet to be disappointed with the food.  Steaks are always done just right, pizza is great,  soups are tasty however I wish they had bigger bowls, they are only about 1/2 a cup or seem like it anyway.  Beef ribs are ginormous! And so good.  So many good menu items, my default is the steak sandwich with baked potatoes.  Steak, rare.  The place is extremely busy on game nights before the game.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Tried this place for its rave reviews, but sadly on this day very disappointed with the Baked Lasagna and meatballs. The portion size was pretty small for the price IMO and meatballs dried right out.  Maybe it was pizza they were referring to.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
We have gone to this resturant for many years.  Its great comfort food and good service.  Some of the staff have been there for years. Pastas are very good and the old school pizzas are fantastic.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"This needs a Connor Mcdavid super star cook,super star staff and make over at this place!

I have been here before for work lunches many times, and recently set a meeting over the lunch hour. We made reservations and arrived on time, the parking lot which is usually full with dining patrons was empty-literally. I looked through the windows and seen their lights were still on, so we went in.

There were only about 4 tables being used among a sea of brown empty chairs and tables all vacant-just like the parking lot. I began to wonder why on a Friday afternoon at 1 pm  no one else wanted to eat here?

There were two lunch specials each for 16.00, their prices had gone up, we ordered the fish special but it only came with soup and salad so payed extra for thick cut fries and gravy, other guests ordered the chicken salad and chicken strips with fries, total bill over 60.00 with non alcohol drinks and lunch/for 3 people-way over priced, No one wanted to finish their food.

Hanging in the front entrance there were some old framed pictures from their past glory days, which reminded me of past visits with better food, lower prices and a busy thriving lunch hour.

 I can only guess that the closing of the rexall place has caused a once beloved restaurant to strive to just stay open, and sometimes the difficulty with trying to live in the past glory days is you only end up living in a shadow of your former self. 

Note to cook, when you cook chicken strips in the same oil fryer as fish sticks-they taste like fish.The other 2 orders with chick strips and chicken salad were just disappointing.I am giving two stars mostly out of courtesy for their past history and glory with a personal promise to myself to not live in this past and also to not return.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Peter and his large family run a wonderful Greek Western restaurant. It has been his passion to have the best marinated beef steaks. Has always been a go to on game night and has pictured displayed to prove it. Never leave hungry, a value at any price. His daughters are very prominent in the business now. I recommend this establishment highly and makes a nice date night or family out.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I'm always on the lookout for a good pizza place and since we were headed to the Eskimos/Riders game, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to check this place out! 

When we arrived it was PACKED, but thankfully we didn't have to wait (at all). The restaurant is quite large and there were a lot of Saskatchewan Roughrider fans (myself included) enjoying a meal before the game.

I ordered a coffee and we got a large 3 meat pizza. Unfortunately with it being so busy, my coffee cup sat empty for awhile. The pizza arrive in a reasonable amount of time, fresh from the oven & piping hot. 

The pizza was very good, no complaints! I loved the chewy crust with the crispy/cheese edge. There were a decent amount of toppings, tasty sauce and lots of cheese. Perfect.

Our waitress was extremely busy, but took the time to compliment my Rider jersey and apologized for being so busy. She was very sweet and was clearly busting her ass to trying to do a good job. 

While we were waiting for our food I saw a lot of delicious food coming from the kitchen. The steak & shrimp looked delish! We definitely plan on returning to try a few other items on the menu!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Well I picked up a pizza for take out.  Have heard a ton about this place.  

I decided to go with the coliseum special which is shrimp all of pepperoni green peppers mushrooms etc.  The large-size about 27 bucks and it was awesome. 

Really crispy thick crust pan pizza. A bit pricey, but that's what you get for home made.  Is also very thick way more toppings and your typical delivery pizza place. 

Definitely a great pizza and I will try to get back here before and we were game to check with the atmosphere that I read some of the reviews. I also posted the picture of the menu so you can take a look as there is no website or online menu.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"On March 26, We visited this place as before a game. Ducks in town. Maybe I should have ordered duck, because my prime rib burger tasted more like regular burger. I asked if I could substitute the fries for Caesar salad and she said NOPE. She didnt even say for an extra dollar or two whatever. I HAD to have the fries, no alterations. At least we all thought she was funny, like the soup nazi on Seinfeld.  So my heart had fries and IM still living. And we wonder why our diets suck and are headed for demise! hehe I will come here again before a game, but maybe stick with pizza for what their people know how to make.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I was super impressed with this restaurant.

My boyfriend and I went here before an Oil Kings game... and when I say before, I mean a couple hours. We had to wait in a very long line up and for good reason -- the food here is amazing. My boyfriend and I shared a ceaser salad and I got a sandwich sub. The ceaser salad was amazing and I loved my sandwich.

I hear that the pizza here is amazing as well. This place gets super busy on game nights, whether the Oilers are playing or the Oil Kings. I assume it is busy on nights when there are concerts or other events at rexall as well.

Be prepares to wait --- but please do! It is so worth the time.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Wasn't impressed with the food at all. Ordered the escargot, was burnt. Then got the Coliseum loaf and was disappointed with the quality. Bread tasted dry, like it was left out for a week, there was barely any meat, but loads of cheese. Thrbsause was bland in my opinion.
The service was great, waitress was very understanding with the escargot. She was very disappointed with how the escargot looked and gladly took it off the order.
Not sure I would go there, or recommend this place again.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Best steak house in Edmonton! Great fresh salads, pizza and steak. Service for the most part is good and the steaks are always cooked perfectly!

The Cesar salad is the best I've ever had!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"My husband and I have eaten here many times over  the years. Before Oilers games and concerts only. I feel the service is very rushed. But that is probably why. In general I find the food to be a great value. 
The steaks can be a little inconsistent. I've started ordering the t bone which I think may be one of their best steaks. 
I love that the meals start with a green salad. They are always fresh and the house dressing is delicious. The garlic toast is great too! 
If you are looking for a reasonable steak dinner with all the fixings this is a great choice. Only downside is that it could use an up date.  Very dated and not a lot of ambience.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
We had a great steak dinner. The steak was melt-in-your-mouth. The service was very good. We will def be back again!,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
We love to visit here. At first you would think the price is reasonable. But when you get your food you will think the price is so cheap! Food amount is massive. If you are a big guy with big stomach definitely should come visit. My brother in law said lobster tail here is the best he ever tried.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I came here for a business lunch and it wasn't too busy.  It did fill up with more customers during my visit but it was never packed nor too noisy.  We were seated towards the back where it was slightly raised from the rest of the restaurant.  They pushed 2 tables together to fit us all.

The server was attentive and friendly to bring us our drinks, take our order, and check on our food.  I found the lunch menu a little limiting as I didn't want pizza, salad, or steak but then again, I am at a pizza and steak restaurant!  I decided on the Coliseum loaf but asked for light cheese as I think it stated it came with 2 cheeses.  It was on a toasted sesame bun and cut in 4 pieces.  There was pizza topping meat inside, I can't remember it all, but I should have known it would be a bit too salty for my liking.  I can't even recall if there was any cheese in it. The sandwich was ok and I think next time, I would stick with ordering pizza as I'm not a big steak eater. 

If we had another meeting here, I wouldn't mind but wouldn't make a special trip for a meal here.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"First time visit to this Edmonton staple.  Went pre-Oil Kings game and it was busy but was still able to get a table for 2 without any problem.  Even joined in singing happy birthday to a 70 year old who was there with 3 generations of his family.  I think my singing caught them off guard OR it was off key.

Ordered a super meaty pizza that was pretty well the best meat pizza I've had in a long time. the dough was amazing and was maybe the best part of making this experience worth going back again.   The service was strong even though the server had a large section including that large birthday party.  We were in and out in time for the game which was impressive because of how busy it was.

Decor was over shadowed by the great atmosphere.  This isn't the prettiest restaurant but the busyness and pre-game buzz made it a fun place to be.  I'll be back.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
So the place tells you on the sign that it's 40 years old and all the good parts of that are clear to see. I had the Coliseum Loaf and my wife had the calamari Caesar salad.  Lots of it was good the loaf was solid and substantial like you'd look for in a baked Italian sub with a side of marinara. It wasn't spectacular but it was very good. The calamari was adequate well battered and seasoned if slightly over cooked. The Caesar itself was over dressed and looking a little like it was mixed the day before. The service was quick and courteous. This was on its way to three stars until I went to the washroom and had to share the stall with cockroaches. Yes plural. I guess 40 years was a good run but it's time for this legend to retire.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Amazing Wow and Wow!!!!
Had steak and lobster kicks the Keg in the ASS.......!

Service kind fast on point if you have not been this is a must place to come",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
Lobster is rubbery .. and steaks.. well all depends who is working that day. hit or miss,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
What I liked: steak cooked to perfection. Diner mushrooms.  Baked potato and garlic toast. Hardy eat. Good eat. Excellent value for the dollar. An incredible steak!,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"One of my fav's and go to places. I've been dining here on and off since the 80's. Great consistent service. The place is spotless and the pizza is amazing.  My fave is the escargot and steak, but all entrees are amazing. I've never had a bad meal.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"We have been going here since I was a child. Delicious food, and reasonable prices. This is a diamond in the rough. Will always be a fave.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"We usually go every few weeks and the food and service is excellent. All that changed last night when we were kept waiting over an hour for our food (the server explained they had a order come in for 45 pizza's) and people who had been seated 20 minutes after us were chewing away at their dinner. We also had to flag our waitress (older, petite, blondish hair) down to order more drinks after a 45 minute wait between beverages!!!! It was later on a Friday night, the dinner rush was over, but we still felt completely overlooked.  
The food is excellent, however my husband had the ribs (his usual) last night and he said they tasted phoned in. My lasagna was perfection and I'm glad I ordered it rather then my usual steak and potato. 
The highlight is always the parkinglot. There is a Porsche GT3RS that always makes me smile and when I am able to park next to it in my Cayenne Turbo (yes, I know, I am not your typical woman...I love cars.) I imagine what it would be like to ""accidentally"" swap keys with whomever owns that car. 
We will return, the food and normally, the service, is just too good to stay away. Besides, I might figure out who the owner of the car is....and convince him/her that a Porsche swap is due.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I haven't been here for a few years only because when I visit Edmonton, approximately once a year, there are so many great restaurants to choose from. When we arrived here tonight there was a line up of people inside to get seated though the restaurant was only half full. Then the hostess was busy answering the phones taking pick up orders. After 10 mins we finally got seated and ordered. The waitress was quick to take orders but did not try to upswell or make suggestions. We chose the NY steak & lobster. The house dressing for the starter salad is a must to try as it is delicious. I have to say when the entree arrived, it was amazing - succulent Alberta steak, decent sized lobster tail, steak fries and garlic toast. One thing though I noticed that our orders sat on the pass for around 5 mins before the waitress brought it to us. This is probably why the fries were luke warm and steak was no longer steaming hot. We also witnessed a young waitress that stormed into the restaurant heading into the kitchen complaining about how busy it was. We really don't want to hear staff complaining about their job when we are trying to enjoy our expensive dinner!!!Although the food was great, it lacks an expeditor, proper hostess and a manager overseeing everything. This place has been around for decades and the interior reflects that. When you walk in there is a Christmas tree (SERIOUSLY) with some cheap dining chairs to sit on. In the dining area there are barrels stored above everywhere and the bar had some tacky tiki signs. Great food can't be beat but the service can definitely use improvement and the really bad old tired decor has got to go. This is why only 3 stars.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I tried Coliseum Pizza and Steak house for the first time and I want to say how impressed I was with this restaurant. My bfs mom mentioned to me that she use to come here for food with her sister and it was one of their favourite restaurants in the city. I have driven by this restaurant many times, but this is the first time that I went in for food. What have I been missing?!?! 

I ordered the steak ofcourse and it was DELICIOUS! Service was also fast and waitress was friendly. This place has been own and run by the same owners for a very long time and they take pride in their food and you can definitely feel it. Definitely recommend and definitely coming back to try out more menu items!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Great atmosphere free parking for oilers games and delicious food. 

One guy in our group ordered his steak 'Chicago blue' which requires a really hot grill. All 6 guys in our group ended up with over cooked steaks... Too bad, but it's probably that guys fault for throwing the grill temp off.

They still get 4 stars because we didn't try to send them back and when the waitress asked how the steaks were, the only guy to respond said 'good'. At least they use really good meat, so overdone is still 4 stars.",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
You don't come here for the atmosphere you come here for the steak (and sometimes the pizza!).  Steak is cooked perfectly and the servers are efficient.  It is perfectly situated to attend before events at Rexall Place and even when it's busy you don't have to wait too long for a table.   Don't come here expecting speciality drinks or gourmet food as it's fairly low brow that way but again consistently  straight forward uncomplicated good food served efficiently.,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I am giving this rating only based on customer service from the CHEF not the food.We went last night for supper (4) people .Waitress was attentive and polite . When i place my order for a steak sandwich , which was a AAA new-york strip? I asked the waitress to please have the chef prepare it rare with no seasoning salts or anything salty . I asked if he could grill it with just pepper on it. She came back moments later apologizing and embarrassed to tell me the chef would not put pepper on my steak .WHAT are you kidding me this is the stupidest thing i ever heard
I should of called the manager but i didnt want to make a scene over pepper. We spent $100 that night and i didnt get my steak the way i wanted it. We will not be back. I am sure if an oiler team member asked for this it would have been done. They should be embarrassed at this customer service. The steak was stringy and not very tender for a AAA",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
Good food and good service. Decor isn't fancy but they know how to cook steaks and their steaks are always good. Best steakhouse,Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"I couldn't believe that when I moved back to the neighborhood after two decades away the pizza was every bit as good as I remembered.  I typically order extra cheese, at Coliseum I don't need to.  Incredibly consistent quality, and still a very comfortable place to eat although the decor doesn't appear to have changed a bit either!  I'm definitely a regular again, and a very happy one.  Only shaved a star because I work long hours and tend to be there at the very end of the day, and the wait staff have more than once started rushing us out before it was even closing or we'd finished eating (and we're always very careful not to go to a restaurant unless we're sure we'll be finished before they close - I've worked retail, I understand!). That said they get the orders right and do tend to take good care of you eg coffee refills, checking that everything is alright etc, and are always pleasant and polite, so on the whole the staff are part of why it's such a good place to go. Please just let me finish eating, guys!",Aa0lDzrdkiiYGJfKjJxcww
"Got the jumbo cheese donair from these guys from skip. It tasted amazing, the flavour was perfect however it was the smallest jumbo I have gotten. Taste was amazing portion size was disappointing.  Price point was not there for a jumbo cheese but close.",AgN2wYfkqbHGvWN3CNdydA
Been here a couple times already as it's just around the corner from my house. Great service and great food. I'm a donair poutine addict and this is pretty comparable to my favorite place which happens to be 30 min away.,AgN2wYfkqbHGvWN3CNdydA
"So I won a 10"" Pizza coupon from the fire fighters action pack when I made a donation to their fundraiser. I asked the lady at the counter if I could buy a couple extra toppings to add to my 1 topping pizza and she refused. Said the head office said no. So let me understand this... your going to make the pizza from fresh... but you won't allow me to pay for extra toppings... makes no sense. Anyways glad I did not waste my money on this pizza. It was dry and tasteless. This was your chance to showcase your pizza to a brand new customer who had never tried Busters pizza before. To gain a new customer so to speak and you blew it. I won't be back or recommend Busters to anyone.",AgN2wYfkqbHGvWN3CNdydA
"Well we were living abroad for years and we're trying to find a Donair place on the south side that would be similar to Queen Donair downtown.  Busters did not meet our expectations, they exceeded them. There's a new benchmark for Donair in town and it's busters. The kiddies had the meatsa pizza and declare this the winner over royal pizza meat lovers. What ever your doing.. keep it up. Cheers.",AgN2wYfkqbHGvWN3CNdydA
Been here a couple times already as it's just around the corner from my house. Great service and great food. I'm a donair poutine addict and this is pretty comparable to my favorite place which is like 20 min away.,AgN2wYfkqbHGvWN3CNdydA
"I hope I don't jinx myself - but we have never had a terrible experience here. We have ordered a handful of times, our food is always fresh and hot. We've only ever had pizza and wings, but it has always been delicious. I have done delivery as well as pick up with no major incidents. I read the reviews and would probably be afraid to order from here but you should give it a try! I should note they once delivered completely raw dessert, but a couple minutes in the toaster oven and it was good to go.",AgN2wYfkqbHGvWN3CNdydA
"Well...I had hoped #60 would be something...different.
I found myself in the area and figured I may as well give yet another Busters a go.
Meh.
I should have waited.
Another uninspired chain offering.
One employee pleasant enough.
Kept trying to upsell me.
The other...the chef...a bit confused.
Just over $10 for my regular and bootle of water.
Service was quick.
Alas...once again...my meat was served up from the warmer beside the spigot.
Sure...it touched the grill...but it still doesn't feel right.
Value seemed alright.
Pita...well...the pita lost a big crust piece right out if the wrapper.
Sauce is boring. Not really thick...or sweet.
Veggies were...ok.
Meat...this time...was at least cut ""correctly"". But it was really too salty for me.
For all intents and purposes...I'm over Busters.
This is the third spot I've tried recently.
And they've all left me...wanting.

Next!!",AgN2wYfkqbHGvWN3CNdydA
"I like this location!

It has the same shabby chic interior that all of the others have, but with so many windows it feels light and spacious. It even has some parking to call it's own, so if you get there early on a Sunday morning like I recently did you won't have any trouble finding a spot for your vehicle (should you drive one). 

I ordered a flat white with almond milk and it was one of the best coffees I have had in my life, ever. A touch of sweetness, perfectly balanced, just amazing. This location really isn't super convenient to either my workplace or my home but I will make the drive just to come back for this on a regular basis it was so good.

Service is pleasant, prices are average for what you see around the city, seating is plentiful and all of those windows let in the sunshine. Perfect coffee shop in a perfect location.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"On the advice of a friend, my hubby and I stopped by for a late evening chai - and we were not disappointed. We both ordered their regular chai, preferring to try the basic before beginning an adventure, and were delighted with the creamy, not too sweet spiciness. Admittedly, parking is dreadful and the seating inside is limited, but the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun and funky. 

Next time I plan on arriving hungry as the food they were cooking up smelled amazing...",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I really am in love with this coffee shop. Not only do they make a good cup of coffee but they have excellent tea too. Love my chai and London fog!  If you like good deals, grab a chai tea and 2 samosas for a light snack before going to the movies. Their dessert options are excellent too. In general this is a great place to meet for a quick get together or have a large group at the family tables. 

I have to say an additional awesomeness of this place is their set up for those that are physically limited. There's a ramp and stairs on the side or you can access the cafe directly from 109 st door. Seating is limited but if you're able, go hang out upstairs. Also, good tip to know is that there's free parking if you sign in to the iPad when you walk into the cafe. 

Staff is always friendly here and today I greatly appreciate the extra kindness extended to me. The cashier made sure to bring my tea over as I'm currently on crutches and well, life's a bit difficult when you don't have hands free to hold that precious hot liquid you've been looking forward to all day. Thank you.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy is the best! 
We have seen this location morph and grow through the renovations and it must be the biggest Cafe in Edmonton. With the best chai in town you can't go wrong. If you enjoy pistachios I would highly recommend the Kashmire chai. But each chai is unique and delightful in its own way. Don't forget to grab a stamp card! 
The food- to die for. We haven't had a bad anything ever! Love the Chana masala and naan! 

Being so close to university the 109th location is typically full of students but we always manage to find seats and a spot to sit.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I used to frequent Remedy a few years ago when it was just a small place on 109. They've expanded this location since and is now nice and bright and spacious. The food here is always delicious and fresh. The coffee is hit and miss, but the chai is always a pleasure to drink.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Only great things to say here! The staff are incredibly nice. The food is great... I usually get butter chicken or samosas. The tea selection is perfect for tea lovers and if tea isn't your thing the Kashmir chai or marble latte are also great. This location has free parking which has come in handy during those long, long study days. The location is central which makes it great for grabbing a drink to go and heading for a walk in the rivervalley!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I was really turned off when the staff didn't know what was in any of the cake slices in terms of ingredients or even what they taste like. The cashier suggested, 'why don't you like google red velvet cake if you want to know what's in it'... Hmm, thanks, if this is indeed an Edmonton institution, then take pride and teach your staff what they're serving at your new location at Raymond Block on whyte.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"If you're looking for great vegan or vegetarian options Remedy won't leave you disappointed!The butter chicken is flavourful and the portions are decent size for delivery. Instead of choosing one side, you can get half of two. For example half naan half rice, which is a great option!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I like Remedy.  Haven't tried too much of the food, but have had the wraps and am waiting to still try the dosas.  Given that I my roots are from the south of India, I must say that I tend to have very high expectations for the dosa clan of food items which is quite different from North Indian food (naans etc.)

Now, what I have tried I really ilke.  They make an awesome Himalayan chai which is green in color.  Strongly infused with crushed pistachios, extremely flavorful and filling.  It's caffeine free too.  It's really more like flavored milk.   I also like some of the other things out there.  They have a large variety of tea bags that you can pick up for your hot tea.

Remedy has some seriously filling muffins etc. to go with tea/coffee for those just looking for the cafe experience.  Mostly whole grain muffins with high fiber and filling as hell, it's great for an afternoon break from work kind of thing.  I like 'em.

The food looks very good, to be honest.  I can't wait to try some of the things.  Dosa is one, but even some of the more traditional north indian varieties look pretty good.  Another review will appear, once I've tried the food!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Best chai lattes in the city (but I get them half sweet). This location, especially, is always busy as many university students study there. There is some parking along the side of the building which makes it very convenient in this area. Otherwise, there is some street parking nearby. I am a big fan of their butter chicken wrap and samosas. They have a combo for two samosas and a chai latte!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Decent coffee, drinks, shakes and ethnic food. But in my opinion, over-priced for the portion.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Terrible place to study!!! Trust me do not attempt!
If you're a loud abnoxious 16 year old girl this is deffently the place for you.

Noise levels ; never ending (open-close) any given day!

If you want good, cheap indian food or just chill out with friends  to drinks,  deffently nice joint to check out.

Studying = not possible",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
My Americano misto was Brutal. Great looking Cafe and the food looked really good. I guess I should of had a snack instead.  Take a pass on the coffee,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
Definitely won't be returning to this location. I parked in the lot directly beside Remedy and received a $50 dollar parking ticket... I was literally in the cafe for 5 minutes and my $5 Chai turned into $55. If the service would have been quicker I probably wouldn't have even gotten a ticket. The tea was fine but I could hardly enjoy it after that experience ruining my day. I wish they were more specific on their parking considering I asked an employee if I was allowed to park there.,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This cozy two-story cafe, close to the university, is always buzzing with students and draws a colourful crowd day and night. It has a Bohemia quality to it reminiscent of places I've been to in Toronto and Montreal that survive despite the mad sweep of chain shops like Starbucks. The smells in this place are mouthwatering - homemade Indian fare including samosas with a tangy dipping sauce, just referred to reverentially as ""The Sauce"" by staff and regulars, that's to die for. The Chicken chana masala in a wrap was so good I've dreamt about it that night! The chef and owner Zee Zaidi is super friendly, and the full windowfront exposure and sidewalk patio are great for people watching; or just sit back and enjoying a pistachio chai latte (it has over 30 different spices in it!) and laugh with your friends at the road-ragers racing by. Life seems to slow down here. Grab a table or comfy couch to lounge or linger on. Beer's flowing on tap and a wide selection of bottled imports are available. Don't miss the case of tantalizing desserts with wacky names like ""I Don't  Usually Do This..."" and ""Desserts is Stressed Spelled Backwards."" A remedy for your sweet tooth, hungry belly, beer- and good-times cravings.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Oh hello there, Kashmiri Chai! How are you? Where did that delicious full-bodied flavor come from? And your green coloring? Hmmm,what sort of magical deliciousness is this that I had not previously experienced? Did you just make this up, Remedy, or is there a whole new type of chai I didn't even know existed? I mean, I rarely drink the stuff so it could be, but I've never seen it on a menu in my home town. Maybe that's because our Indian options suck... but I digress. 

I know you can't be healthy, rich green chai, because thick, creamy drinks don't come from low fat sources, regardless if it's made non-dairy with a substitution of almond milk. Oh, and thanks for being available in almond milk format. The cow-stuff just doesn't do it for me. I can only imagine how creamy it would be when made with yak butter. Mmm.... yak. 

I don't really care that the atmosphere is loud and ramshackle, with tables sort of thrown together and all sorts of university folk doing loud things around me. I can slip some ear buds in, leech off of the free wifi and revel in the comfort of your green goodness. 

Mmmmm... this will be a must-stop next time I'm in Edmonton!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I've been a quite a few times, used to be awesome! But now it's always just packed and loud, with slow service and cold food. Usually 1 person per 4 top table with their laptop trying to be hip and study, not sure how they can concentrate with the noise lol. Since the reno this place has gone down hill in my opinion. My last visit I waited about 30min for my drink that was actually not even made till i said something as it was lost in the frey... Little too big for your britches sorry to say! Think I'll try a different location!?",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I tend to be more of a coffee purist and I'm not a chai guy, so I really come here because it's popular with the crowd.  The coffee is good (middle of the pack in this neighbourhood) and the food smells great, but I guess I don't thing of it as a restaurant and generally I'm not there at meal times.

Our typical time at Remedy is spent talking over a coffee, beer or chai.  It's got a more relaxed atmosphere than the nearby Sugar Bowl and I'd say a more Bohemian vibe than the hipster scene across the street.  It's more conducive to visiting and conversation in the evenings.

This end of 109 is getting to be quite the evening spot.  There are a couple of sushi spots, a couple of diners, a couple of espresso cafes, a really decent pho place, and with Sugar Bowl and Remedy you can stretch the evening out with drinks and coffee (along with Indian food) before popping into the Garneau for some Art House.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I've only been here for their drinks until recently. I tried their butter chicken wrap and was pleasantly surprised by the quality - nicely flavoured food with chicken and everything that is consistently ""spread out"" through the entire wrap.. Also, their second floor is quite nice.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"They make a mean espresso.  Coffee here is quite good.  They have the biggest selection of baked goods I've seen compared to most coffee shops in Calgary or Edmonton.

The establishment has freshly squeezed OJ and an assortment of Indian dishes to satisfy those with more empty stomachs.

There is ample room to sit.  It gets crowded but they have two floors and lots of walking space between the tables.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I went to Remedy with some friends a week ago, and was delightfully impressed. I had heard raves about the chai, and it definitely lived up to the hype. With soy milk and almond milk for those of us who are dairy-free, tons of vegan options, and gluten-free as well, I'm recommending it to everyone I know. Yeah, the music's a bit loud, but that didn't stop us from having a great time!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"The first time I had coffee at Remedy in the Garneau district was in May of 2015...it is a very nice looking coffee shop with lots of seating, large windows, and plenty of choices for food & drinks. But the only table I found was dirty, but I didn't have much other choice, so I sat there anyways. 

The second time I went, which was last night will be the last night. I don't really feel comfy in these types of cafes...there's almost this hipster vibe, or something similar to that, where I just never feel 100% comfortable. 

Anyways, I ordered my ""large"" regular coffee, which was okay...but at nearly $4 a cup, it had better be decent! But I waited more than 10 minutes before I got it...it sat for half of that time forgotten under the steeping machine thing-a-ma-bob! It wasn't even hot by the time I had to ask the cashier guy to grab it for me! 

I can see why many people love or like this place, but it's not for me, and I will avoid it from here on in! #yeglove #yegcoffee",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"My first time here last night, came in to have a Chai Tea Latte, It was so good I couldn't believe it.  And WOW the Wraps and Samosas were excellent. I had some kind of samosa, that had curry and potato and the pastry of it was almost like pie crust.  It was really good.  I think my wrap was a butter chicken, it was really good too. I cant really remember the names of everything I tried my brain was infused with alcohol and I cant remember what I ordered exactly just how it tasted... Yummy and I'll be back.     I'll do another review when I go back and this time I'll get the names of what I had..:P""",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy has got easily the best Chai Latte in Edmonton, hands-down. A great atmosphere here with plenty of seating for groups of all sizes, this is a great place to come with a whole pile of friends, or your laptop to get some work done.

They have a terrific selection of indian food. I haven't tried a ton of it, but I remember really enjoying a veggie samosa.

But seriously, if you do nothing else, try the Chai. Authentic and delicious, one of the gems of Edmonton",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I would say they have absolutely the best Chai Latte in the city!  I quite like the atmosphere very trendy and always busy often with university students and also often Remedy has some great art work from local artists on their wall to check out or purchase.  

I have eaten a few times and have yet to have something bad, mind you I haven't been too adventurous.  I did try their Masala Dhosa and it was delicious, I had the veggie one and am glad I opted for it as my friend had the chicken and found it to be too filling with the meat.  But I guess if you have a large appetite that would be perfect.  I have also had their breakfast sandwiches a few times and love them, I don't know what sauce they use but it is very tasty!

I don't think a lot of people think of desert when they go to remedy but I have to say they have some of the best cakes and pies I've had and it is always a plus when you can order by the slice.  A personal favorite is the Kitty Lime Pie, I'm not sure why Kitty is in the name but it's what drew me to it and holy pie batman it was amazing!!!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I'm a big fan of Remedy. I've only ever had the Chai, but I know that is one of their specialties, and it is excellent. I'm sure the coffee is good too, but i always judge a coffee shop more on the overall vibe than the drink. I mean, let's be honest, you go to places like this to meet friends and have conversations, first and foremost. Remedy has a relaxed, cool, accepting feel to it. You'd feel comfortable wearing business casual, or hippie clothes, or workout gear, or just about anything else. 

I've also had some of the food, and it's great too. Try the dal. Also, I really like the recent renovation. Even with 50% more space they still manage to be full every time I stop by.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"yep it's a weird place.  super busy all the time, but man those samosas are good!  Chai is homemade and if you like REAL chai, they sell it here in a jug so  you can make it at home!!! 

University crowd and difficult for parking, but like I say in my other reviews, don't let parking stop you from trying out some awesome small businesses in the city.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy Caf√© can easily position itself as a place for total free spirits. What an interesting place and what a unique crowd! I came in knowing that Remedy caf√© serves best chai in town, and that Indian food here is worth a try. As soon as I stepped in, I made a mental note to myself that this place looks like a garage of a hippie dude in the 60s. The furniture is worn down and the walls are covered with posters and ads. Nearly every sit was occupied by cool looking young people who intently stared at their laptops. The girl at the counter greeted me with the big smile, and as she began preparing my order of tandoori chicken bowl and a cup of chai, I took a sit in the corner at the back of the caf√©. It wasn't long before my food arrived. Tandoori chicken was perfectly marinated and a bit spicy. The hot cup of chai was sweet and comforting, and every bit as good as they promised. As an added bonus to all the great food and fun people watching experience, Remedy caf√© is open till 2am every day (the kitchen closes at 11pm). Arm yourself with a laptop and come here on an empty stomach and with an open mind.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Hipster central.

Honestly, I mostly go here for the people watching. And chai.

They have definitely found a niche market in Edmonton. The Chai teas are their signature drinks. But they also serve alcoholic beverages, kombucha, and other fizzy drinks.

Food wise, their Chana Masala wrap and Samosas are my favourites. Great dishes to share when you want an afternoon snack.

Even with the renovations, the venue fills up fast. I would recommend scoping out a table while you are waiting in line. Bringing a friend and having a strategy is always the best way to go. 

You also may be waiting for your food or drink for awhile, but it is all a part of the experience. Just keep a look out and listen for the orders.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Usually I have no problems at Remedy. However, when I went with a girlfriend last week I was unimpressed. The hummus wasn't the same, the pita was hard, and my chai latte was more foam than chai. There were flys buzzing around while we ate. Seemed inconsistent.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I used to live in Edmonton, and recently I paid Remedy another visit after two years of being a part. We were in Edmonton for a week, I was at Remedy on three occasions, that should be telling. I like the place. Once upon a time it had delicious vegan cheesecake, that time appears to be no more. However they still have lots of other vegan or  gluten free and/or other treats that look delicious but I've never eaten.

They have an amazing selection of teas, I've never counted, but it looks like at least 30? 

Parking is terrible, take the bus, or park on the street. The lot beside Remedy is usually full, and has always been. They are generally catering to the campus/pedestrian crowd, and you can tell with the random music playlist and the general ambiance of the place. You'll notice some exhausted academics plodding along on their laptops because hey - free wifi with power outlets makes for a good nerdy time.

There is also alcohol if that's what you're looking for, and dinner options (for nearly anyone, omnivores and vegans). I wish Remedy was in Toronto, because it would be appreciated, and I'd probably go there at least once a week. I miss you Remedy.

For additional amusement, please note the delightful graffiti in the bathrooms. It's kind of awesome and/or silly.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I can't even justify giving one star because of how blatantly rude their staff are at this location. Not much else to explain. Normally they're fine but now I'm definitely not coming back here. 

Girl makes my drink without all the toppings. No biggie, I always get the vegan hot chocolate and they always make it with nuts and coconut on top. My drink is overflowing on the counter and I can't drink any of it because it's so hot. There is literally milk pouring everywhere. I ask another girl kindly if she can put it in a different mug and she was like ""Oh yeah of course, no problem, sometimes the whip cream just makes it overflow."" I'm studying upstairs and would rather not get everything sticky and covered in chocolate. Then I asked if I could get the toppings, like the nuts and coconut. She says of course, hands it off to the other girl to make (short, blonde hair, glasses) who proceeds to slam the pitchers down on the counter, make a big scene, and angrily top my drink with the wrong toppings, making it overflow, again. Nice. Thanks a lot. 

To top it all off, I get a few eye rolls and snarky comments made about me to her coworker while I'm in clear earshot. Disgusting, catty behavior. I don't even have the energy to talk to some of the people here, because when I politely ask for a modification I get treated like garbage. Next time I'll just go to transcend across the street because I'd rather not be treated like I'm useless, incompetent, and annoying when I'm nothing but nice to people working there. 

In short; Drinks are fine (when they're made right), food is decent, but customer service is lacking and staff are beyond rude. Will definitely be following up with management as it's more than unacceptable.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I have been going to Remedy Cafe for over 15 years - at the various locations. I have been really happy with them until today. I ordered my favourite, palak paneer with rice. Remedy has always done a great job with it but today, it fell short, very short. They used to use flavourful, real spinach, with a great mix of spices. Now it seems like it's bland, canned spinach, and the paneer just disintegrated. I am so disappointed. I won't be ordering that again, and I'm leery now of ordering anything other than their drinks. I do enjoy their great drinks (Kashmiri chai, lattes, etc) so I have given some stars. 

Please go back to your old recipe for palak paneer. Remedy was one of my favourite places to go!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This is a great place to study, read, drink, relax or catch up with a friend. There's plenty of comfortable seating, and it never gets too loud or too quiet here.

While you're here, I would highly recommend the Ginger Chai Latte for a warm, spicy treat. They also have a gorgeous display of decadent cakes, including gluten free options. I had a slice of the Red Velvet Cake, and I felt complete.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Close to the University is this great Chai Tea provider as well as great London Fog options. Any of their hot beverages are best enjoyed during your stay because the paper cups render the beverage a paper taste. The pressed wraps are quite filling, however their chicken dishes are undersized (there isn't enough nann bread or rice for the amount of chicken provided). On my many occasions to this venue, I have seen many first dates here. The music can be rather intrusive, however, the second floor provides a decent sanctuary for studying. 

There isnt much light after the sun sets, and you can ask the cashier behind the counter to turn them higher. The chairs are usually soiled with light crumbs and some of the black seats near the window are kinda broken.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy was one of the first cafe's I found when I first moved to Edmonton, that actually felt like a cafe to me.  It's one of a few cafe's in Edmonton where you can feel a real sense of community inside. I have noticed it's popularity grow within the last few years, which makes it a little harder to find a spot to sit during the evenings, but if anything that's just a testament to how great the place is. The food is great for the price in my opinion, and the chai is something I always look forward to.  They have a variety of coffee drinks (their brewed coffee is quite a good brew imo), iced drinks (and chai milkshakes :D) , and a pretty good selection of beers. The food is mainly a selection of indian food and deserts (cakes and pies) with fun names. Overall it's a great place to go to kill a hour or two, read a book, bring a friend for conversation, and enjoy some good food and drink.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Yes, Remedy is home to my favourite chai, has conveniently late hours, and some mean vegan selections... but that's about it. 

This joint is crowded, too loud to make conversation, always has a dirty bathroom, and there's nothing too particularly endearing and homie about it.

Also a little over-done with people out on first dates, which is indeed hilarious for people-watching.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"One of my favourite places for a butter chicken, nicely seasoned and delicately balance. The matcha latte little bit too sweet. Overall this places are the best for tea lovers.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Amazing food, (best in edmonton) chai, beer, tea, everything! Plus I could not ask for a better experience of yummy indian food that is set at a really affordable price. 
I love how many different people it caters to, vegans, omnivores, vegetarians, and when your crave a beer to go with your indian food at the same time its there and you have so many different choices of them.. even draft!
Plus all the pies and cakes have been named something cute/funny or both.
However, I do wish the staff smiled more, danced more, or talked a bit more! They are nice, but for a cafe with such great food I wish they also were that outstanding.

mmm chai!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"We occasionally like to go here for dinner.  They have really improved their ordering system and having the little space ship buzz when it's time to pick up your food is a big improvement over the old system where you hoped that what you were picking up was what you had actually ordered and paid for. I like the gluten free wraps and my spouse likes the chicken and rice. We each ordered our preferred version of the chicken and had more than enough to eat. They do have some vegetarian options which is nice.  

The food is not exactly child friendly unless they are into chick peas, and  I recommend you take the kids elsewhere to eat but especially for the bathroom which is decorated with pornographic graffiti.

They seem pretty tolerant of table hogs, which I guess is a plus, if you are an entitled 19 year old narcissist who likes to leisurely sip chai lattes while writing your papers in the midst of a busy restaurant, sending actual diners balancing their food as they trudge to the upstairs cafeteria seat",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I love Remedy Cafe! There's no other coffee shop like it in the city. This place is always busy with all types of people--mostly bohemians and University students, but this place is very welcoming to all types of people. 

The tables, chairs, and couches in this place are ecclectic--making each area of this coffee shop interesting and different. Remedy has an inspiring atmosphere, so this is the place to have great conversations or to write (as long as you don't mind noise). The music they play is cool--usually a lot of indie ranging from rock to electro. 

I don't drink caffeine, but there are a lot of other choices like interesting cans or bottles of juices or carbonated beverages, Italian sodas, and alcoholic drinks. They also serve Indian food, delicious cakes, and other baked goodies. 

Remedy is a lively, interesting place--much better than any bar I've been to.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This is one of my favorite places in Edmonton that will leave a lasting impression on me now that I've left the city. I went there probably 3 or 4 times in the last week and really enjoyed it. I had only been there 2-3 times over the course of this last semester, and regret not going more often until my last week in town.

Their coffee drinks are very good, and they have an excellent selection of bottled beers, as well as a few beers on tap. Both upstairs and downstairs, there is a good selection of seating. My favorite is the set of couches upstairs. Kick off your shoes and get cozy with your computer and the couches - either alone or with a group of people. There is free wifi, too.

Their appetizer dishes are all excellent. I had a wrap that included tandoori chicken and something else involving spinach and potatoes, I believe. It was spicy by my taste, but not for Indian food. Good bang for your buck!

The location of Remedy is also prime; you can take any number of buses that go up and down 109 street, and it is a short walk from the UofA campus.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This place needs a missed connection category on the website. The sheer amount of gorgeous individuals checking each other out is ridiculous. You can't stand in line without making eye contact with someone beautiful. It may be the hang out for university hipsters but there are also a lot of rugged, beautiful guys there with or without stylish lady friends...clearly, something for everyone. The cashiers tend to seem a little frazzled, hung over and unbathed but whatever. I like the coffee and the atmosphere on a Sunday is super-delux. If you don't mind the DIY cafe experience where you might have to steal chairs from another table or linger in line a little longer waiting for numb-nuts in front of you to figure out what a CHAI is than this is the place for you and your buds. Five hour movie patience is required. Plus, it's worth using the 'please clean the bathroom more often' washrooms because there are crass novellas written all over the walls. Nice touch.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy is the best! 
We have seen this location morph and grow through the renovations and it must be the biggest Cafe in Edmonton. With the best chai in town you can't go wrong. If you enjoy pistachios I would highly recommend the Kashmire chai. But each chai is unique and delightful in its own way. Don't forget to grab a stamp card! 
The food- to die for. We haven't had a bad anything ever! Love the Chana masala and naan! 

Being so close to university the 109th location is typically full of students but we always manage to find seats and a spot to sit.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Wonderful staff who are friendly to out-of-towners.  I had a wonderful gluten free paneer during my first visit, and quite possibly the best chai I have ever had.  Everything was so lovely that I went out of my way to go back a second time.  I had a slice of cheesecake and a different kind of chai.   The gals behind the counter were extremely welcoming and gave me some wonderful recommendations for things to do on my first visit to Edmonton.  In all, it was a wonderful experience both days.  Also, treat yourself and indulge in one of their many treats.  It is well worth it!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"My gf and I went here after a dance class. We had healthy shots, tea, cookies and food. Everything was really yummy. This location is very big and it was very busy. The energy was great! Lots of adorable nick nacks for sale. I'll definitely be back.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"The butter chicken with rice and naan is worth it, but has become recently more pricey than comparable butter chicken dishes nearby! In addition, all of the chais in the menu are great and their cake is one of my go to places when you're just craving a slice of cheescake or other cake.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I stopped by Remedy Cafe for a late-night snack and coffee with a friend. The crowd is hip and young - a lot of university students finishing papers (free wi-fi!) and chatting philosophy. It's a great place to do some people watching.

I tried a vegan coconut chicken dish, which I wouldn't order again (points lost for its weird veggie texture), but the desserts here are to-die-for. Each cake and pie gets its own clever name, such as ""Fudge Judy.""

I would recommend Remedy for its lattes and atmosphere, but I would stick to desserts only next time.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I am a regular customer at remedy however this location is horrible. They don't have enough staff in the back to get people's order out. I ordered and waited 30 minutes just for a take out. The worst part is, three people behind me had their ordered filled and mine was probably sitting in the back. The lady didn't even apologize, she just said.. We are busy but there was no line up. Frustrated.. Going to a better remedy location.  Avoid the attitude.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I can't believe I haven't made a point to review Remedy yet! I come here on a fairly regular basis and don't see that changing any time soon.

When I first moved to Edmonton a year and a half ago, I was told by countless people that I ""needed"" to try the chai at Remedy. Once I finally made a point to check it out, I completely understood the enthusiasm. It's absolutely fantastic. I especially enjoy the Kashmiri chai which is flavoured with pistachios and rose petals. Divine! Plus it's decaf so you don't need to worry about grabbing one before bed.

As for the food, I find Remedy to be hit or miss. You can order the same dish two days in a row and end up eating something that tastes completely different. Sometimes it's fantastic and sometimes it's nothing particularly special. It's never been very bad though. I do love how vegan/vegetarian friendly the menu is. I tend to order the vegan butter chicken whenever I go here for food. Yummy!

My biggest issue is how slow the service can be. I honestly don't really blame the staff for this one. I don't know how the managers can justify having one person on the counter on a Friday night. It's ALWAYS busy at Remedy so this shouldn't be a surprise. Don't go here if you're in a hurry at all.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
Always like the chai tea!  Home made and one of the best in the city. You can also get take out indian food to go as well :),B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Vegetarian/vegan/meat friendly tasty food, but I always feel mildly sick afterwards. Service is friendly. Very average espresso. This place gets very busy. The chai tea is famous, but too sweet for me. Actually, all non-meal food I've had from here has been too sweet, but that's my own fault--I don't like sweet food.

This place is popular for a reason, you can't go wrong with Remedy--although you wont see me there.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA

First the wrap was quite good. It was the service and the attitude I did not like.  It is total self serve.  They yell out when your drink is done so you have to listen until it is ready the come get it.  Then you have to come get your wrap when it is ready.  But when you pay with a credit card it prompts you for a tip.  A tip for what.  I had to find my own table.  I had to go to the counter to order.  I have to go back to the counter twice to get my order.  They couldn't even combine my chai and my wrap into one trip.  Arrogant and greedy asking for a tip.  Won't be back,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I really enjoyed the Butter Chicken Wrap ($12) , the quick service, and friendly staff! Was able to dine in for about 1.5 hours without any rush to leave since you can order at the counter and wait for your food to be called out. There were tall boundaries between each table which was a nice touch. The wrap came with a sauce, but it was equally good on its own. It had rice, chicken, turmeric, cumin, and peas.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I went into Remedy last night to grab a tea to go. A friend of a friend had recommended the green dragon oolong (I think that's what it was called). I went with it and really enjoyed it. It was light but smooth. They had a huge tea selection as well as other drinks, plus food. For being a Sunday night at 10:30 there were quite a few people there. I really like the atmosphere, felt very laid back and a great spot to grab a bite to eat and a coffee. I've also heard the chai here is really good, so I think next time I'll order a chai and stay for a bit.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"We ordered the butter chicken and were blown away by the flavour. The price was great for a generous serving and some delicious warm naan. The chai latte I had was also above average. The atmosphere was casual, open, and friendly; the workers were kind and helpful about inquiries for allergy info. I'm sad this business is local to Edmonton but I will recommend it to all my friends who travel there.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"A coffee house with an ambience of a hipster, Indian, and casual scene.  No pretentious vibe that you see with mega chains like starbucks, second  cup etc.....The Kashmir Chai was amazing. I am normally dubious about the staff of these hipster coffee houses, but the staff was very friendly and influenced my selection of the variety of beverages.  Although the food may not be fine dining experience, the samosa's provide adequate sustenance to tide one over until dinner.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Overpriced, but the food is not horrible. 

What's horrible is the fact that none of the food is prepared fresh. They often utilize microwaves to heat-up pre-portioned food that may have been cooked many hours, or even days, earlier.

They have a good selection of drinks, but don't expect good food. They're incredibly lazy and uncaring with that part of the business.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
This was my first time trying Remedy Cafe. We ordered take out for my work and a staff member had to pick it up because there was no delivery until 12:45pm which was a little strange to me since lunch time would be one of the busiest times for delivery for them!  This is the only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of 5 star on this review. The food and the portion size was awesome! I had the butter chicken with half rice and half naan bread. The yellow tinted (turmeric?) rice was delicious and well cooked. The butter chicken sauce was not too spicy and the naan had a nice chewy texture. One of my coworkers couldn't stop raving about her Chana chicken dish. So next time I'm going to try that out. We have already planned our next order date from here. Give it a try!!,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I do not recommend this place at all. The drinks are a little rich in a bad way, but there are worse problems than that. What earned this place the two stars is how incredibly terrible the food is. Ever heard of seasoning, people? Add a bit of spice once in a while. The food is inedibly bland.
From what I could tell, they seemed pretty used to people handing back barely-touched plates of food, because the fellow who took it from me didn't even try that ""Is there any way we can make it better or improve your experience?"" damage control that most restaurants and coffee shops practice.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This cafe has recently been renovated, and looks amazing. It's a modern, bright, open space with tons of windows, and also tons of people. Try and avoid getting there right at lunch time when the line can get long. 

This is one of my favorite spots for lunch in the university area. The chana masala and palak paneer wraps are excellent - warm, full of flavor, and wrapped in grilled, soft white pita bread. They are priced around $8 to $8.50, and are very filling (sometimes I take half to go). They are served with a raisin soup/sauce... not exactly sure what it is, but it is so delicious. I have never had it anywhere else. 

People love the chai here, but I find it a bit sweet. Last time that I was in I ordered a regular coffee. I think that they made the coffee to order. I was a bit taken aback at the price ~$3.75, although it was a fairly large cup, freshly made, with excellent flavor. A minor note that they only have cream out to put in your coffee... I prefer milk. I assume they would have given me some had I asked.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"First off I'm not a starving/earthy student so this restaurant isn't geared toward me. I only came in for dessert, but it was really good and I'd still go again. 
The whole vibe though is not somewhere I fit in though. It's young, earthy students working on laptops or hanging out with friends eating vegan natural foods.
The restaurant is shabby chic and somewhat small for how popular it is so sometimes it can be hard to find a place to sit.
It does have free wifi which is great if you're not the Starbucks type.
Only bad thing is the time the cashier takes because he or she also gets your food so it's a long wait. Change that and I'd give it a higher rating.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"WOW, so impressed with the renovations! In my book, this Remedy location, has gone up at least 3 stars since my last visit.

I first stopped into Remedy a few years back and just hated it! It was old, run down and smelt terrible and the customer service was not good. And I know some people liked that ""starving student"" hang-out vibe... I did not. It was gross. I never came back. (I actually thought I had written a 2 star review - guess not). Then I was asked to meet there for a meeting, so begrudgingly I went. To my surprise the place has completely been re-done. 

Remedy is now airy, clean and fresh. The gross moldy-pachouli hybrid smell has been replaced with the heavenly smell of delicious foods. And the customer service - well, lets just say I was quite impresses! The young man working the counter went out of his was to be helpful. Even making taster size versions of a chai for us to try out. Remedy Garneau, I will be back. (But not the downtown location, that one's crap wifi irks me to no end!)",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Places like Remedy are fairly common in bigger cities, but I think this place is fairly unique in Edmonton. (If you know of other similar places, I'd love to hear about them!)

They serve coffees, chai, indian food, desserts and a small selection of alcoholic drinks. Their booze prices are surprisingly good, although if you try it's not that hard to drink them out of something. They have a number of vegetarian-friendly options, and I love the sauce they serve for dipping with wraps and samosas.

Remedy is good for studying or drinks or coffee with friends. Their wifi works (most of the time). The only issue is that sometimes it can be hard to get a seat in the evening.

One more tip: don't ever go here if you're trying to hide the fact that you've been. You'll smell deliciously like the food, and anyone with a half-decent sense of smell will bust you.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy Cafe has a really chilled out atmosphere. It brings in a very artsy crowd and many students. The place gets surprisingly busy and you may find yourself having troubles finding seating in the evenings. 

Many people here are just doing their own thing on their laptops or chatting it up with friends. The serve more than just coffee. You can find desserts, beer and other food here. I love their breakfast food personally. 

I would definitely recommend Remedy.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I used to come here almost everyday until I moved, but I still make the journey from time to time. My favourite: chai latte with hummus and pita.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Mediocre at best. Extremely over priced. Staff are pretentious.

Be warned: If you're not a granola-eating, body-odour-omitting, satchel-wearing hipster, expect to get treated like a complete weirdo. The reusable spoons are usually dirty when ""clean"" (even bright and early in the morning.) The bathroom has the worst graffiti I've ever seen (I get it; ""let the customers express themselves"".... But at what cost?)

Although you may try to be polite and make a point to engage with the staff, they are extremely off-putting, to put it diplomatically.

Let me get this straight: I'm expected to tip, AND put my own dishes away in the designated area? Lol... I dunno. This place & the premise behind it repulse me.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I decided to have a delightful brunch on Saturday morning and accidentally ran into this unique corner cafe in Edmonton.  The atmosphere is a grand blend of  uptown business class and hometown offerings of couch seating.  It was suggested to me to have the Masala Dhosa with spicy vegetables smothered with a light curry, this lentil bread had an 'old world' flavour that was a unique surprise.  I loved the presentation as it came along with the tangy mint/cilantro, curried yellow lentils with chilies, and the sweet coconut and sweet tangy sauce.  These dipping elements added a refreshing opposition to the spicy hotness of the curried Masala Dhosa.  In my opinion I think that this offers nutritive choices from the old world that makes this cafe special.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I absolutely love their chais, I recommend the Ginger or Kashmiri especially. I would drink three a day if I were able. The menu overall is quite large and features many Indian-based dishes that are well prepared and tasty (try the samosas and their butter chicken). The staff have always been polite and friendly to me even when they're super busy. I typically wont stay and eat/drink if it's busy but that's ok cause I'm close enough to throw rocks at their building from mine lolol.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I don't get the ravings. I'm not a tea drinker, so I can't comment on the chai. My ex seemed to like it. The service I had was always friendly enough, if slow, but but the samosas and masala are terrible. This is not Indian food. I have had Indian food (the home cooked kind), and this is not it. It wasn't even good by regular standards. The desserts were meh. Then again, I'm used to having home made desserts by a very talented French man. Am I spoiled? Maybe. But this place is nothing to rave about in my books. I ordered a chocolate milk from them once, and I asked if it was going to be just plain and simple. The girl at the counter said yes. It came out all spiced with cinnamon and god knows what else. I left with a massive headache. If this is your thing, and you like fake ethnic food, be my guest. Remedy is not my *ahem* cup of tea.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Dear Remedy, 

I have been a big fan of yours ever since you had the first one near the university on 109 st many many years ago. 

You have amazing chai and the atmosphere is good.  If I was rating you on  those alone you would get 5 stars. 

Unfortunately I am rating you on something else, your lame pricing. 

I got a remedy bottled water today.  It tasted, looked and felt like regular water.  It was great.  What is not so great?  Your insufficient posting of prices, Remedy.

When I arrived at the single til after the long lineup  realized why it you do not price your bottled drinks. 

Your water costs $4 Remedy!

Damn!  That is most be at least a 1000% margin.  I do not how you sell this but I want to invest, asap! 

Its true, you made it on the bottom of my list of places to visit Remedy but I am 100% in with you guys when we decide to take this water worldwide.  Water for $1, what a joke! Pffff...$4 is the new $1 water. 

Starbucks $2 water tastes like crap after drinking this $4 bottle.  You can quote me on that Remedy.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I have a strange love-hate relationship with the Remedy Caf√©.

I love the location, the energy and intention of the staff, the promise of the menu, and the design and d√©cor: the big, bright windows and comfortable chairs perfect for lounging are a great counterpoint to the cold and chill out-of-doors.

I hate that the menu doesn't deliver the excellence it promises, the food is just 'good', the flavors are very westernized without the subtle touches I've found in Indian / Pakistani restaurants. (Remedy is still better than many other lunch offerings, but not as good as it could be.)

I hate that the chai varieties are good, but not great, with a pre-made flat flavor that completely lacks the subtlety that a really good chai delivers. On the rare occasions that I make a simple chai at home, I can get a better flavor with only a handful of spices, toasted before make the brew. I know Remedy can do better.

Still four stars: Remedy is a comfortable and pleasant place to spend time, with a good selection of coffee, chai, and juices. All it would take is one inspired manager to make Remedy a five-star happening.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Well seriously, who doesn't love Remedy. It's the perfect place to go on a date or meet up with your girl friends for coffee chats that last hours. I've had some great drinks and food at this location and some even better heart to hearts with great friends. The staff are wonderful people, it's close to campus making it an ideal off campus, but still kinda close venue to get away and study. 

I find this location is quite busy so you may have to wait a little while to find a table. Over all though I would never pass on an opportunity to hit up remedy, it's pretty rad!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"While I love their chai, the place needs a good cleaning. It just gets worse and worse as time goes on. 

I'm not sure if it just laziness or too many hipsters.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"My extra hot half sweet Chai Tea latte is soooooo good!! Delish samosas, especially the sauce..yummy! I also love the palak paneer wrap and their desserts....oh G-d!  People at the counter.. just pay and go, don't expect a ""How's is your day going?"" at all..",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"The whyte avenue remedy is my favourite location to swing by for a chai - it is definitely the smallest location that I have been to - but it has never had a long line up and is the easiest location  to get to for me, the chai has got me hooked. I don't know if I would sit and study or hang out there for longer than the time it takes them to fix my drink - but I'm a ""to go"" kind of girl and that's why this location suits me just fine.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"The curries went up $5 from 10 to 15 and mine literally had 4 pieces of vegan chicken in it :'( I even asked for more but they said there was nothing they could do. 

Great staff, but if you're going to jack up the food prices, don't skimp.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
So great to have a cool local cafe.  Great for  dinner in a pinch to feed kids and wife with dietary issues.  The wraps are great meal anytime.  Coffee done in all forms in spades!,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I haven't been to this location in a long time. I was pleased to see that they recently renovated and expanded the space. It very open with lots of seating on the main floor with the upstairs seating remaining the same. The atmosphere was abuzz with lots of students studying or taking study breaks.  Even thought it was busy, there was still a chill vibe and my friend and I really liked that. I would say that all of the cafes now have a congruent look to them. I am a fan.  We ordered or small chai lates to stay. They were delicious but sometimes can be uber sweet. I have learned to order them half sweet so that they only give half the serving of chai syrup in the late. My one complaint about this chain is that the drinks can be overpriced, however, the food is fairly inexpensive and is delicious whenever I have eaten here. It's always a good place to go chill or catch up with friends.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I've been to Remedy once every few months over the last four or five years. 
It's a nice place, I enjoy the vibe and they have great food, the chai lattes are amazing and the staff is friendly. 
It's usually a little too crowded for my taste so I avoid it if I'm not meeting up with a large group, but it's great for a larger group (if you can find room). I do sometimes find that there's a high frequency of people sitting by themselves on laptops trying to take up a large booth for themselves though.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This cafe is ""line up and order"" style. I met 3 people there after an afternoon film at the Garneau. They have several types of chai on the menu   but I chose a pomegranate juice. Once you order they give you an electronic buzzer to let you know when your order is ready- I like this and can name a number of restaurants who could benefit from this system.The butter chicken wrap comes with mayo unless you specify- I asked for hummus instead. I ordered mine ""gluten free"" for an extra dollar, and got two small wraps instead of a large one. I found my gluten free wrap to be heavy with yellow coloured rice.- so the proportion of curry to starch was rather thin, given that I paid over $20 for a wrap and a drink.   I traded one of my small wraps for a  palak paneer wrap- cheese and spinach. I found there was too much potato mixed in with the spinach Also, the tamarind dipping sauce that came with 3 out of four wraps was turned into a thin, pancake-syrup-like substance by too much water, sweetening (sugar) and cinnamon-way to ruin tamarind sauce. I much preferred the hot mint sauce that one of my friends got- green and spicy- sorry don't have the name. It was all quite filling, and I still had a stomach ache the next morning so I'm a bit wary of their ""GF"" claim. I had a taste of a friend's tandoori chicken and  I thought it was quite good- I like spicy so I might try that next time-or just stay away from wraps altogether. Sorry left my camera at home so no pictures.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Very Good coffee, easy environment to be in. Good for small personal meetings, studying, just chilling in general.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I love love Remedy! 
I always get a Pomegranate Ginger Ale and a Butterchicken Wrap when I go. 
However I recently have gone and they seem to be changing the Butterchicken wrap. It's significantly inferior than what I have had before. 
Worse, today it was completely different, with a multi grain wrap and not containing all the ingredients. 
Not sure what's up with that but it was underwhelming.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I love the atmosphere of this cafe. Very cozy and welcoming, amazing hummus and naan! The food is on the cheaper side and the portions are larger than average. I love how this cafe accommodates varying food preferences: vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free. Vegan cakes! Mmmm. Well known for their Chai, which you can get with whole, skim, almond, or soy milk. I definitely recommend the Vanilla Roobios Chai. You can't go here without trying it! Only recommendation would be to serve food instead of yelling out the order. It can get crowded at times with everyone ordering and picking up their orders at the till. Other than that, awesome!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I went there one afternoon to meet up with a friend. I have to say the latte I had was great..Soy chi. Really lovely tasting and the atmosphere was good. It was just really really crowded in there. That is my only criticism, we basically had people standing over us, hovering and waiting for our table. I think its the lay out..its not the greatest.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Once upon a time, I had come to this cafe while visiting a friend. However, I forgot where it was and what it was called. This was a couple years ago. I had been woeful ever since, for every cafe I from then on stumbled across in Edmonton was not this one. 
Yesterday, before heading back to Calgary, I asked my friend, ""Where can I get some delicious vegan food before I take off?"" He replied, ""Remedy. You have to."" And so, I set off to Remedy. And upon walking in, I came to a startling realization... THIS WAS THE CAFE. THIS WAS IT!
I was immediately charmed by this shop. It was so beautifully buzzy, and full of people doing their own thing. I had stopped in to grab some food to go, but quickly began to wish I had brought in my laptop to finish from projects for class. I was a little overwhelmed to see a section on the menu board labled VEGAN! I had a hard time deciding, but eventually settled on veggie samosas, one of their notorious chais, and a giantic vegan gluten free gingersnap.
I took off with my delicious things and away I went. My good evolutionary theory, was that the best ""chai"" (the word chai admittedly kind of pisses me off, as it translates directly to tea) I have ever had. 
Next trip to Edmonton, I am eating here only.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"TL:DR A female staff who seems to work there VERY often is ALWAYS extremely RUDE. Either acts like she owns the place or hates being there. Makes you feel uncomfortable to even order. 

I really do love Remedy and most of the people who work there, and the owner, so it's unfortunate that because of a staff, I really don't think I'll be going back to Remedy much again (at least not the one on 109 ST). You'll probably bump into her 8/10 times you visit. She usually makes the drinks but occasionally she does work the till, which is when it becomes an issue. From what I've noticed, she doesn't seem particularly nice to her own colleagues either. She is very rude to customers and acts like she's way better than literally everyone else. One time I'd gone, I'd purchased a mug the night before and hadn't noticed there was a crack starting on one end of the handle so I brought it back the NEXT MORNING. I wasn't asking for a refund. All I wanted was an exchange. Without even really looking at it she told me it wasn't a crack, that they were all made like that (which I know for a fact they're not because I'd seen the other mugs when I was there the night before) and that I was wrong. Everyone understands what cracks are so I'm not sure why she'd bother lying. After a while of trying to reason with her, she finally gives in. She goes to grab me a different one. And oh what a shocker, that one didn't have a crack on its handle even though she said all of them had it. On another occasion, she had taken my order with a stone cold face without even a quick hello... wasn't a huge deal... I then gave $10.25 for a vanilla chai and she she gave me $5 back as change. I blanked out for half a sec and hesitated as I took the $5. But apparently that was enough for her to snap at me and say ""you get $5 change, that's it"" along with glare. She could've just ignored my brief hesitation or asked if something was the matter, but no.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Is there any good way to wait for your food at Remedy? They just shout it out when the order is ready, but you don't know if it's actually your food or someone else's who for the same thing. Plus if you're sitting upstairs it's almost impossible to hear anything that's going on downstairs, so it's difficult to know when your food is ready. But no one wants to stand by the till and wait there 10-15 minutes for their food to come out... I just really do not understand Remedy's service system. 

That being said their food is wonderful. I particularly like the butter chicken and curry chicken. They are to die for and are ridiculously filling. They've got tons of options for all you vegans, vegetarians and celiacs! All you lactose intolerants and but allergists should probably do a quick check with the staff before you order though. 

The store is kind of... Grungy feeling? Not in the cool and hip kind of way, but in the dirty and questionable one. I feel like the way that some of the stuff near the till is arranged in a way that would easily accumulate dust and I have a feeling dusting isn't priority number 1 here. Table tops and whatnot are usually clean but don't look too hard at the floor. 

I'd say just get your food to go. There isn't really any reason to stay in store. The music is loud. It's often super crowded. And you leave smelling like spices and curry if you eat in.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"good food, good chai. Place is dirty, bathroom is disgusting.. try to avoid it if possible. 
prompt service but lady at the till seems to be cranky all the time. No smiles at all. Pretty much ""just pay n get out"" attitude. its not just one particular person, its pretty much whoever is on that till. This seems to be the issue only in this location. I have been to the one downtown and whyte ave n people there are very nice and polite.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"It's not the best place to get food, but it is if you want something quick. 
I still think the food is just microwaved and somewhat fresh. The chai is good though.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I was raised under the Hare Krsna movement. I grew up eating Indian food on a weekly basis. Hell, I cook Indian food at least on a bi-weekly basis.

Remedy Cafe is definitely a funky and hip little cafe/restaurant (of sorts). I wasn't too crazy about the Chana Paneer, but the Chana Masala and the Daal are both fantastic. My only qualm would be that, as someone who knows Indian food well, the pita bread they give in substitute of naan or roti, doesn't quite work. However, the vegetable samosas, though a little on the small side, are delicious.

Definitely not where you want to go for truly authentic Indian food. But great if you want something more modern and funky, with a nice mellow atmosphere and fair prices. Remedy Cafe is certainly a place I will go back to from time to time. When looking for a calm ambiance and food with a twist, this cafe is certainly the remedy.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Really great coffee shop with a huge menu! They have quite a few locations all over Edmonton but this one is probably my favorite. It's spacious, good for studying (although loudness and outlets may be an issue) and for socializing. What I appreciate too is that they have a big food menu as well. I've had everything from their samosas to rice dishes to wraps and they're all very satisfying and filling. My only complaint is that it is a little pricey. Its not the most cash friendly but to be honest it's worth it as a once in a while splurg. Their cheesecake is also quite tasty as well as, of course, their drinks. I'm not the biggest fan of their coffee black but their Chai and other tea drinks are good. They have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options as well - for sweets and eats. There vegan cookies are certainly on the thin and hard kind of side but taste wise they don't fall short! Being in the university area there's quite a few students going there and usually it gets pretty crowded, it's rarely even half empty. 
Fun fact: there's a magician who shows up sometimes as well to entertain people which is pretty darn awesome. 
All in all I think remedy is a safe bet for a coffee shop and if you haven't checked it out yet you absolutely have to!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"The food was okay! It wasn't completely Indian food, I felt as it was a version of Indian food where that everybody can handle.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I like the Remedy Cafe because they can accommodate vegetarians, vegans, gluten free, and meat eaters!  Not many restaurants lay claim to this kind of consideration.  However, I just feel like all their food tastes the same-- maybe I'm just not appreciative enough of East Indian dishes... Their chai tea latte is amazing though!  And I love how they give you the option of soy, almond milk, or dairy milk!  All in all, a nice little place!  The music was a little loud though!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I've only ever wound up in Remedy to check out the folk-musician shows they sometimes host upstairs on weekend nights; it's definitely the sort of place that hippies and students call home, with a wide array of teas, cozy couches and the mouthwatering scent of Indian food wafting about both floors.
Samosas are tasty and affordable, and being licensed, Remedy has a huge selection of beer both on tap and bottled (and carries my absolute favourite treat, Fruli). After reading all the positive reviews though, I'll be back soon to try the infamous chai and have an actual meal.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Oh Remedy, you will always be the home of the university hipsters.

Are you vegan? Gluten free? Dairy free? Soy free? Fun free? Well then they've still got the perfect drink or food for you.

But seriously there is very little to complain about when it comes to Remedy. The only real problem I have with it is that it's always so busy it's quite difficult to get served. If you do have some time to kill then it's probably worth your wait, but definitely do not expect to just grab a quick coffee and head back out.

A lesser known fact about Remedy is that they are also fully licensed. They have a very good selection of beers as well as all of the normal selections of mixed drinks. When it comes to wine, I do not believe there is much of a selection.

If you have any allergies or just appreciate a good espresso drink, there's something for everyone at Remedy.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I've only had the Chai here but it is hands down the best I have ever had. I've only been here a couple times. No reason why. Mostly because I'm generally not in the area. But come to think of it I really should come more!

The Chai is more spicy than you would normally find at Second Cup/Starbucks but it has a pleasant kick to it. Although for those of you who can't handle spicy it may be slightly too strong.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I like Remedy.  I'm always impressed with the tea selection and the vegan chicken curry wrap is mouth watering!  I would really love to know what they put in the sweet dip sauce on the side..  Apple juice, cinnamon, maple and ???  I must know!!

It's always a little loud, and a few of the staff members think they are more important than the rest of us specs of dust, but we won't hold it against them.  The girl with the short hair is always super friendly, and really I'm only there for the food.  Thanks for staying open late Remedy!  PS your ladies washroom mirror could use a cleaning, I think it's growing fur.

Bring on the chai!  Xo",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I love this coffee shop. I have never gone at night though (I am starting to think I should, after reading these reviews!).

I used to go here every morning for a coffee and a bagel. The bagel had egg, cheese and bacon on it and my god was it the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my life.

I would walk in and the man behind the counter (I am pretty sure he is the owner) would call out ""coffee and bagel?"" like it was my first name. 

Keep this in mind though-- it is clear that breakfast is not their strong point because it does take FOREVER for them to whip this marvelous thing up. There was once a time where I told the guy working I had to leave to catch my bus, and he realized he forgot to start my sandwich. He told me to get a free one next time.

The next time I went in, he remembered and gave me a coffee and bagel for free (well, I guess not for free, because I had paid for it the day earlier..)

It really does have great coffee though, and wonderful food. It is an awesome place to go and read or study. BUT bring an ipod. It can get pretty loud in there and if you can't concentrate with background noise, you're screwed.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
First time at this location. Had the chicken Chana for lunch. Excellent. And the chai is the best in Edmonton.  Always a great place to eat!,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy Cafe is nice for a hot meal.  And by hot I mean spicy.  Portions are generous, food is inexpensive, and there are a number of alternatives for people with dietary restrictions.  Customer service has been consistently friendly, and I'd like to stop by more often.

It does have a few downsides - the layout is very crowded, it's not terribly clean, and the music is definitely too loud for conversation or studying.  Anyone allergic to nuts or diary will need to watch out - a number of the curries contain almond milk, which may limit your choices.

All in all, it's a conveniently placed hang-out with good pricing, good food, and a few flaws.  Worth it if you're nearby and want curry!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
I really liked this place the first time but realized that all their chicken tastes the same the second time. Kashmiri Chai will always taste good though. Even with soy. That's what they get four stars for.,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
I love you Remedy Cafe.  I love your Veitnamese Ice Coffee and your Masala and your homemade Chai!  I love your chilled out atmosphere and your late evening hours.  I also love your take home food!  I always feel at home with you and I miss you when we are not together.  I think I'll start spending more time with you.....we both deserve it.,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"The chai was absolute perfection, and this place is great to grab a beverage to go. I do like that there are options for every diet type. 
We ended up waiting literally a full twenty minutes for a bagel with cream cheese. Many people who came after us got their food first. When I approached a staff member, she assured me that the bagels are made authentically (aka, toasted) so they take longer than the regular dishes, which are merely microwaved (gross). I mentioned to her that I understood, but that I thought 15-20 minutes was a little excessive to wait for a bagel. She said it was because there was a rush. I feel like a plain bagel with cream cheese should not take more than 10 minutes (max) so I was disappointed. After asking her to look into it, it still took an additional 10 minutes. I was already finished my chai by the time the bagel came. Not wowed.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy is a really cool place to kick back and relax.
The majority of patrons are students, art folk and bohemian hippie types.  The reason for this is the atmosphere at Remedy - it's very chill and laid back.
My fondest memory of Remedy is their apple pie.  Oh, how I love apple pie!
A lot of people go to Remedy for the chai.  If you are a big chai fan, you need to check out Remedy because it is their claim to fame.  Delicious!
The food at Remedy is, for the most part, Indian food.  It's a great snack and the spices will keep you warm on a cold Edmonton afternoon.
Remedy also serves desserts, beer, coffee, and some other drinks.  It's really just a great place to relax.
If you haven't been to Remedy, I recommend giving it a try.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy's a great place to hang out and enjoy a bite to eat. I love the atmosphere here, very laidback and fun, and the food and drinks are excellent. They just got a very nice new paint job as well :)",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This location has undergone some pretty major expansion and renovation changes in recent times... and this was much needed as it used to be FAR TOO BUSY for my liking on a regular basis. Now, I still think it'll get pretty darn busy on occasion but it's now perhaps Remedy's largest location in town. And the seating is colourful, the walls have fun patron contributed art, and there are numerous seating options both indoors and outdoors. 

My favourite beverage at ANY Remedy location is always the Kashmir chai, but I do love some of the other chai options (and I've yet to try them all at this point to be honest!). I do like the food that they provide: it is ample and there are numerous options. I'm probably most likely to visit here just for a beverage, but I do really love the chana masala wrap for example.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"How have I not reviewed you yet, Remedy Cafe? 
This is the perfect place for those who want Indian food at a great price,dessert or a snack.
They have a deal with samosas ans chai for two for 12$. I go for the Kashmir chai - it different from usual chai (which they also have) because it's caffeine-free and green in color and has pistachios in it. So delicious and I've never seen it anywhere else.
As well, they always have a ton of dessert choices (pies, cakes, etc.) in the cooler and the selection seems to change quite a bit so you can try something new. They seem to have lots of vegan & vegetarian options for food and desserts, so if I was a vegan, I'd go there even more. 
If you're lucky, one of the armchair pairs in the front window will be free. It's pretty uncommon, though - this place seems to be busy every day at any time. And rightly so.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This is a must visit for any Edmontonian. Remedy is synonymous with the best Chai Latt√®s. They have a few to choose from but I suggest sticking to the original:) I have ordered hundreds of these...

They have a LOT to choose from but I frequent the samosas and dahl/curries. I leave with food sweats every time. It is SO GOOD! (As long as I remember to ask for no cilantro! Why does that stuff exist?...)

The atmosphere is also pretty good. A nice spot to sit and read/study or catch up with a friend. 

Free wifi = happiness",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I love Remedy Cafe! They have so much selection of drinks, including americanos, lattes, teas (seems like a hundred to choose from!), and of course their famous Chai!  Different locations offer different variations of the chai, but the 109th street original location has them all.  I've had their regular Chai and their Kashmir Chai, both of which are amazing. 

If you have dairy requirements, are vegetarian or require gluten free, they can cater to your dietary needs.  

109st and 87th ave is open late, so it is perfect for a late night drink.  They also have alcoholic beverages, so if you want a coffee and your friend wants a beer, it's a perfect compromise!

Also, their butter chicken and naan bread are delicious!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"While I enjoy basking in the hippiness of soft music, mismatched furniture, dirty toilets, dreadlocks and yoga mats, I'm definitely underwhelmed by Remedy.  I've not been a very active Remedier - having probably been there about 6 times over the last two years.

The list of chais that they serve here is an impressive one. While I do enjoy the Kashmiri chai and their regular chai, I happened to have the ginger spiced chai today and was quite disappointed.  In general, I'm not very fond of overly sweet chai but that's something that seems to be sell well, so I do consider Remedy to serve great chai.  However, in the ginger chai the ginger wasn't mixed at all and the drink was just a regular chai till I go to the last two sips that were extremely pungent.  It's okay - it's still a solid 3 star chai. 

The masala dosa, on the other hand was at the far end of the rating spectrum.  I've heard so many Edmontonians speak praises of how good the masala dosa at Remedy is, so I figured I should give it a try.  Now, I'm not one of those Indians who generally expects a lot from Indian restaurants.  Having said that, this dosa I had today was probably the worst rendition of any Indian dish I've had in Canada (thus far).  I say rendition because it is certainly Remedy's interpretation of what a masala dosa is. However, it's an awful interpretation.  The batter had a very weird and rubbery texture. The filling (masala) was an unfortunate stir fry of vegetables that had flavors far from those expected in South Indian food. I was extremely disappointed.  I don't want to get into how bad the chutneys and sauces were.  The whole experience was, coming to think of it, a waste of calorie intake.

I have no clue why they make masala dosas if they're going to make it like this.  All in all, I'll come back but stick to chai.  The wraps and other food is a decent 3 star, but nothing evoking a 'Wow!'.  I understand that Remedy is dear to many and I love that they're an Edmontonian food presence.  I much prefer the chai at 'Chai Pani' on Whyte.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Following up my previous review, I've made a point to try Remedy's chai tea and can finally understand what all the fuss is about. Warm and creamy with a thick velvet foam sprinkled with spices, the chai is a world away from the syrup concoction served at Starbucks and its ilk. I've gone back again and again for this tea delight, and Remedy provides the perfect compromise - chai for me, beer for my companion. 

I've also finally tried their samosas, which rate similarly rave reviews - they're spicy, served with a thin, sweet cinnamon-y sauce on the side. 

Remedy's only downside is that it's usually impossible to find a seat.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Mmm mmm good!

I like the consistency between different locations for Remedy Caf√© - especially the drinks!  Huge fan of the hot chai selection tastes fabulous - my favorites being Kashmiri Chai (rose petals & pistachio) or Badamee Chai (almond everything) with variations of milk choices (soy, almond, 1%)!!  Some of the mugs are large with nice logos and positive sayings, which I like :)
The food has always been delicious!  Love how they use the heavy copper-steel plates and handi (I think?) for dipping sauces.  The samosas are nice being just spicy enough for me to be able to munch on, but I love the butter chicken dish and (grilled) butter chicken wrap (spicy just righty)!  Foods are uber flavorful and delightful - probably the closest I've come to Indian/Pakistani fusion :D

The layout of the restaurant is also really nice - your choice of tall tables and bar stools, variety of chairs and sit-down tables, vintage cushy lounge chairs and coffee tables, nice mood lighting (not too bright, dim or high color temperature), lower floor, upper floor, etc XD

Nice central location near the university and Whyte Ave, which is probably it's greatest downfall as well (being flooded by 109 Street traffic and tons of students during exam periods)...

However this caf√© is still one of my top favorite cafes!  ^_^",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I've been to Remedy several times over the last few years, and while this location is certainly a step up from the previous, it also lost its small coffee shop charm. As a coffee drinker the new $3.50 price tag on regular coffee (a large is maybe 12oz) is very steep. The taste and size being comparable to a McDonalds coffee, which rings in at half the cost. 
I won't be back.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
Definitely one of the best places for Kashmiri Chai! The perfect blend of steamed milk with pistachios in perfect harmony makes for a lovely treat!,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy is primarily known as a hangout for students, activists, and artistic types.  The atmosphere is thick with culture and creativity, and the art on the walls rotates on a regular basis.  A lot of people come here for the chai, which is delicious and frothy.  The food, which mostly consists of Indian and Pakistani cuisine, is also abundantly enjoyed.  

My favourite is the palak paneer, a thick blend of spinach, potato, and spices topped with cubes of cheese.  The chai and samosas are a perfect snack, although the dipping sauce is more reminiscent of a syrup than chutney which is traditionally served with this kind of food.

Remedy also serves coffee, beer, and a host of other cold and hot beverages.  There is free WiFi for customers, and lots of comfy chairs and couches upon which to relax.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"We live almost right beside Remedy, so it's a neighbourhood staple. Best to come first thing in the morning, when it's super quiet, or else you might be hard pressed to get a seat. Remedy did some renovations and expanded their space, and it's honestly beautiful. Their gluten free, dairy free, sugar free options for nearly everything makes Remedy super accommodating for nearly everyone to frequents there. The artwork on the walls are from locals which jazzes up the place, and supports local talent. Also, they make amazing naan bread. I definitely want to try more menu items, especially their butter chicken!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Out of my five long years in Edmonton this place is one of the (very) few  things I REALLY miss about the city, other than the wonderful people.  

I sometimes have dreams about the chai lattes, no joke. Oh, the chai, the chai.... how I miss that delicious elixer of chai-y goodness. I have hunted high and low in many other cities across Canada for something that remotely approximates the magic that is Remedy chai. I have not found it. 

So yes, Remedy chai is amazing (both soy and milk versions). And the dahl. And the samosas. And the vibe. Love the crowd here. Sometimes I consider hopping on a plane back to E-town just to get a fix. And that's saying something.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Remedy is an awesome cafe and very popular with Edmontonians. They have lots of comfortable seating and the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming so it's the perfect place to curl up with your laptop if you're needing to get some work done or to meet up with a good friend for a long chat over a delicious beverage. I always get the chai latte when I come and it's one of my favourite chai's ever, it's just as delicious with any of the alternate milks as well. They can also accommodate different dietary needs from vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free etc...",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I'm usually not a fan of cafe's, preferring better tea at home, but remedy has a good selection of chai, so I occasionally drop by for a taste. Today I ordered a plain chai, and what came out was an iced chai. I love my tea hot, but I'm also always up for something different, so I decided to keep my serendipitous gift. It wasn't disappointing, but I probably wouldn't order a cold one again.

I also, on a whim, decided to grab a curry chicken and channa meal to go. I'm not overly fond of Remedy's refrigerated meals, but they do in a pinch and I didn't feel like cooking lunch today.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
By far my favorite place to go for a quick bite. The choclatey turtle cheesecake changed my life. The girl who helped me was very friendly despite the place being packed.,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I love the food here!

Remedy is currently in some kind of transition stage while undergoing renovations. The new atmosphere is nice and bright, a lot more open and clean looking than the last outfit. 

The woman taking orders was super pleasant and friendly which is a very nice surprise. On past visits I've always found the staff to be less than friendly and almost rude in some cases. I've come to expect unfriendly service here so that was a nice surprise.

Food was delicious as always. My friend and I shared the butter chicken wrap, as they are decent sized portions and we can never finish the whole thing to ourselves. Its always so tasty and I especially love that sauce that goes with it. We both ordered the Kashmir Chai and it was good, although I didn't care much for the rose petals they top it with. It was great for presentation but they kind of took over the chai. I'd order it again without the rose. 

I would have given 5 stars but there's one thing I didn't like much about the place, I'm hoping its a temporary thing while reno's are happening. They are quite busy here and with all the new tables, which are totally necessary, there's very little room for customers to line up so people are constantly crowded and in each others way. Also the system of picking up your food isn't working... Instead of 2 chai's they only gave us one, no big deal but then when they went back to make another one there was no pick up system in place and people who had ordered after us kept jumping in to swipe the chai  we were waiting for. A number system like they have is good if they actually reference the number when calling that an order is ready.

All in all, its a good place with great food, even if its full of hipsters.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Their butter chicken is absolutely overrated. I hated it, please don't be fooled by the reviews from people lacking taste buds. Good day.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
Amazing chai and amazing food. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area. There's ample seating for lots of people and I loved their robust tea offering. Food includes meat and vegan options so there's something for everyone!,B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"It's interesting to compare the pre and post renovation reviews. Clearly people like what they've done with the place. I've always liked this REMEDY, even when it was a hole in the wall.

The chai is delicious, the tea options are plentiful and the food is satisfying. The service has always been friendly and quick (especially considering how busy they can be). And now there are lots of great seating options, whether you want counter, table or lounge style. 

As for parking, you can leave your car in the lot just south of REMEDY, just don't forget to check it in on the ipad before ordering.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"The chai lattes are by far the best in the city, perfect every time. Your quintessential hipster hangout, Remedy is definitely geared towards university students and local cool kids.

I took away one star because this location always has their (often terrible) music turned up much too loud for a coffee shop, and the baristas are a bit standoffish. I just bring my noise cancelling earphones and smile as big as I can at the grumpy baristas! Still worth it.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"I came to Remedy on advice from a fellow Yelper whose word I trust. Unfortunately my experience was far from good and bordering on downright horrible. First of all, the parking options are non existent. There is a private lot on either side of the building but both are for other businesses. There is no street parking so you either have to park illegally in one of the private lots or find a spot and walk atleast 2 blocks. I don't know if Remedy had the option to get a few spots in either lot but I would suggest that they try. Even if it cost them revenue to buy some spots this would be returned from the increase in driving clientele (virtually everyone has a car in Edmonton). 

Anyways, I chose the illegal parking option since I was only planning to be there for 20-30 mins. Little did I know that the employees had different plans for my time. Upon arriving I was the only one at the counter. No one in front or behind me. I was unfamiliar with the menu so I asked for advice for a snack and drink. Two employees advised me of the 2 samosa and chai tea combo which sounded good and was reasonably priced at $7+tax. I paid and my iced chai came pretty quickly. While waiting for my food a 5 person lineup appeared. 

I waited inside the restaurant to get my food before moving to the patio and taking advantage of the sun. I proceeded to wait what ended up being 34 minutes (I only know this because I texted a friend right when I sat down). I watched as 4 of the 5 people after me received their food. The 4th person ordered the samosas like me and I walked up to get them but was informed that this wasn't my order. This put me over the edge. I expressed my feelings and how long I've been waiting and the employee didn't even apologize, just said they'd go make it now. I was fuming! I waited another 5 minutes from that point and finally received my reheated, fried samosas that weren't even that good. They were greasy and uninspired. Once again I saw no remorse from anyone working there at my horrible user experience.

My remedy is to never give any money to this business that clearly doesn't care and hires staff that reflects those same poor ideals. Oh and this is my first 1 star review and I'm not happy that I had to give it. I'd much rather enjoy spending my money and getting respect and thanks for my business.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Perfect place to catch up with friends, work or people watch. 
I always seem to loose track of time when I'm here.

Chais are a specialty and the wraps are delicious! 
Parking is hit and miss though, it always seems to be busy.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Loved the atmosphere in the newly renovated extension, very cozy but still very busy.

Ordered samosas and a coconut London fog. The drink was amazing! Loved the sweet hint of coconut.

The samosas were spicier than I'm used to, and I don't think you can ever find two samosas made the same way, but these weren't my favourite. Willing to try other things on the menu though. The sauce on the side helped a bit with the spice but I didn't care for it.

All in all, good experience and will come again. 

Oh! And I think their custom cups are absolutely adorable!",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"Didn't look like much from the outside but an interesting cafe with very good Chai Tea, great deserts and a HUGE tea selection. Many beers and scruffy hipster loco locals abound.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"This'll be short and sweet.

As many others have posted, the chai and some of the desserts are delicious.  However, I find none of the Indian food tastes like Indian food.  I went there shortly after a trip from India, and have been back a time or two with a friend that really loves the place - but it doesn't stack up to other places boasting authentic Indian fare. 

It is full of uni-hipsters, some incredible artwork, and some snazzy tunes, which sets a real cool vibe in the place.  Something I give a big thumbs up for.

Cafe - Yay.  Resto-bar - meh.",B3JF06ctShiYJeg1FyJ5jA
"As a sushi snob from Vancouver, this is actually a great place to eat sushi.  I have only been for lunch but everything was wonderful.

We went around 3pm and surprisingly the place was full!  The hostess seated us and it took a few minutes for the sever to come over, which didn't matter because we were reading the menu anyways.  When she did come over she apologized for the wait as she was the only waitress working.  
I ordered the chicken and tempura bento box and a dynamite roll.  My friend also ordered a bento box and the avocado roll.  The food came quickly and tasted amazing.  The avocado roll was my favourite!!  It was a maki roll with these tempura crumbs inside, this delicious mayo and avocado strips on top.  I could have eaten the entire roll myself!
The decor was that of an average Japanese restaurant- nothing fancy just simple.  You don't go to a restaurant to check out the thousands of dollars they spent on the decor- you go there for good food and Kyoto is one of the best sushi places I have been to.  

I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who lives in the area or is looking for a good sushi place downtown.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"My favorite sushi spot in Edmonton! Their food and their service are both great!
I always get the kyoto roll which is a mix of spicy tuna and shrimp tempura roll - its great! The momiji (smoked salmon) and rainbow roll (assorted sashimi) are good too!",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"This was one of the first places I ever (reluctantly) tried sushi. (I grew up with a brother allergic to seafood, OK?) Even before I ever went down the raw fish route, I still liked Kyoto because of their great bento selections. 'Fraid of the fish? I was, but I was always happy with teriyaki chicken/teriyaki beef/tempura kind of bentos.

When I finally did take my first bite of California roll (after being seduced by the avocado roll), I never looked back. The sushi here is good! The menu has a wide  selection, too, most of which I still have yet to try, but I'm working myself up to.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"First time at Kyoto! We had the pleasure in sitting in one of the rooms where you are able to sit on the floor. But, it is super comfortable as there is room for your legs under the table and we had tons of space. Just watch out when you try to get out. One of my dinner guests might have got stuck...

We had the vegetarian gyozas and tempura to share for appetizers. They are both great dishes to share with a group for appies. Surprisingly, one of the tempura pieces was salmon! I definitely was not expecting that, but it was a nice surprise.

For makis, we tried the Maximite (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado) and the California rolls. The makis were quite large than I am used to, so they were a bit tricky to eat! Definitely had to take several bites and we might have made a bit of a mess. 

My only recommendation is that they update their menu online to be the same as in the restaurant. I checked the menu online first, but then was all confused when I was at the restaurant as it was quite different.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Absolutely garbage service. Had one decent experience here so I decided to bring my family for lunch. Everything arrived except the Salmon bowl, and then arrived once everyone was done eating after asking twice about where it was. Food was fine but service was absolutely horrendous. Decided to try and come back one more time to rectify the bad experience, went with my boyfriend and I ordered a bento box, we ordered a rainbow roll to share and he ordered a salmon don. He didn't want farmed salmon, so he asked for wild salmonand they told usit'd be an extra 5$. It came out with 3 pieces of salmon, and the other half covered in tuna which he specifically asked not to have, and then when we asked for what he ordered they told us it'd be an extra 4$ after already being told the price for what we ordered. Absolutely HORRIBLE service, we spent several hundred dollars here over the last few days and we're treated like garbage. The manager would rather sit there on her phone or gossiping than actually come and speak to us. Despicable service, DO NOT COME HERE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Friendly service and very tasty food.  Ordered the seaweed salad, gyoza, edamame, beef tataki, and jelly fish salad to start and a range of sushi and Sashimi.  Portions and sushi pieces were huge.  Would definitely come back next time I'm in town.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Kyoto is one of my favourite place to go for sushi during the school year because it's so conveniently close to campus. Around lunch time it's always quiet and they've got lunch bento box deals, which are great value! 

Their sushi is always very good and doesn't take too long to reach your table. Sometimes it can be a little on the warm side though, but I've never had any that were super fishy tasting. My favourite rolls are the Maximyte and rainbow rolls. They are wonderful! And also more filling than you would expect since there's all the rice and tempura going on. 

They give you complimentary miso soup and little bean sprouts in sauce that I could eat all day long. Who doesn't love a good complimentary starter? 

Definitely one of the better sushi places in Edmonton.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Every food tasted very blend. 
Sushi rice needs more seasoning, every maki had way too much rice and had no flavour. 
Food served quickly, prices are low.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Very disappointed in our service today. We ordered lunch take out. We ordered two bento boxes as well as an order of rolls. It looked disappointing, tasted disappointing, and my kid's bento had a hair in it. No thanks! It is much cheaper than other places like Mikado and Dorinku but it was a waste of time to drive all the way there to pick them up. My shrimp bento was hidden by a huge glob of mayo dressing, the fish was over cooked and hard to eat. My daughter's chicken too. Salad was limp and flavourless. If you are broke, I suggest you save some money and have some decent Japanese food.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I have been to Kyoto near Argyll but I went to this one on 109 because it's right next to my house. What a great meal! I got the spider maki, and a dynamite roll, along with green tea. I had a dessert there, but can't for the life of me remember what it is. It was so good though! I would definitely have it again. I'd like to come back and try the sashimi as it looks really good. The service was super friendly and quick (I feel bad because my guest and I were just gabbing) but the server was very patient. Will be back again!",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Kyoto never fails to delight. A really great lunch spot. I always start with an agadashi tofu which is really one of my favourite dishes of all time. I always choose a bento box, option D with double chicken. The tempura is so light and not at all greasy, and the teriyaki chicken is nice and crispy. The Miso soup and bean sprout salad which they serve as soon as you sit down is a really nice touch. A good lunch for less than $20.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Kyoto is always a great go-to for sushi. 

I like to go for my birthday dinner and always order the grilled squid with the excellent sesame sauce. mmmmm 

The servers are ALWAYS curteous, smiling, prompt, thorough and great with keeping the tables cleared after a plate is finished. 

Prices are exceptionally reasonable for such fresh food. :)",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"This place is awful. The staff have no idea what they can and cannot do. My friend just wanted a veggie bento with no tofu and it was the most painful process to get that done. They also charged her more for taking something out of the bento. The sushi rolls are dense with lots of rice packed in a thick layer. The rice is cold and stale, the fish looks really dry and old. I won't ever order sashimi here again. I seriously thought I'd get food poisoning (I didn't). I also ordered Uni Nigiri because it was in season.  I don't think the sashimi chef has ever touched Uni before in their life! It was all broken and mushed. The quality of food you get is on par with grocery store sushi from Vancouver with a high price tag.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"So this is the second time I have been seated here and then been left without service for twenty minutes. No water,no drink, nothing. 

 Is it really my job to track down a waiter?  Just got up and left this time.  No one noticed. Big suprise. My recomendation is to just keep walking.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"The worst sushi I have ever had.  The construction is absolutely terrible, the rice falls apart from the everything.  Portions are small.  NEVER AGAIN.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I've been to a lot of sushi places, and this is bar none the best. All ways good and fresh food. Plus they serve streak, for the people who don't like sushi. Its Fantastic, almost like stepping into Japan it self. Great atmosphere.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Food quality is good, portion are generous. 
Waitress always rushing and forgetting part of the order. Food comes out at different times I eat while she needs to wait for her meal 10 minutes later.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Edmonton does have decent sushi after all.  Yay!

Parking is available at the front of the strip mall, though it's a really ghetto lot.

The inside is somewhat classy, though I recognize some of the decor from Ikea.  Nothing wrong with that though.

The service was reasonable, though not all staff wore uniforms.  As a result, there were times when I didn't know who to flag down.

Chirashi don ($14.80) - generous portions and lots of different types of sashimi.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the seafood tasted.  Reasonably priced too.

Isobe Maki - salmon, tuna, and avodado mixed into one roll and lightly battered.  Interestingly, this roll does NOT contain any rice.

One last thing: tea here is NOT free.  It's measured at $1.50 a pot.

Overall, I was actually quite happy with the food quality, and pricing.  Recommended.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"So let me start this review out by saying I've never been to Kyoto Japanese Cuisine before, although I've known about it for far too long. A staple, go to for many Edmontonians and with two locations to boot (their other digs are downtown on Jasper Ave and 109 Street), they're doing quite well. 

I went with a friend on a Sunday for an early dinner (6:00pm) and it was fairly busy. The interior is slick and modern. Didn't realize they would have private tatami rooms (where you sit on the floor) but that's a nice option to have if you have a big group or want some privacy.

Pretty decent hours if you're looking to grab some late night sushi (11:00 am to 11:00 pm Fridays and Saturdays). 

- Squid karaage ($6.50) - no picture but these were quite good. Crunchy, light, and addictive. 
- 2x salmon, tuna, toro and hamachi ($2.30 each) - from top left and going clockwise, we ordered two pieces each of salmon, toro (tuna belly), hamachi (yellowtail) and tuna. The quality is decent but I didn't get that creamy, melt in your mouth, must order more that I normally get with toro and hamachi. Ordering sashimi is definitely not cheap at Kyoto!
- Tsunami ($11.60) and maximite ($10.80) - the tsunami maki (front) had salmon, unagi, tempura shrimp, tobiko, crumbs and mayo while the maximite maki (back) consisted of spicy tuna, green onion, tempura shrimp, avocado, masago and mayo. Both maki rolls were tasty, presented nicely but again, nothing to rave about. They'll fill you up if that's what your going for.

If I come back again, I will have to try out their ramen (I wasn't expecting that on the menu!). Not sure if they have it all the time but it was on their daily special menu. All in all, Kyoto is what I would call a safe, reliable bet to get your sushi fix.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I regularly have sushi here, more so for convenience than anything.  As far sushi goes it is not the best I have had in the city but it is very good and is probably the best bet for sushi in the Garneau area.  The servers are very friendly and price point is good which is never a bad thing!",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"The food is very delicious but when you order ... make sure you have chop sticks, soy sauce, wasabi, ginger, ponzu sauce ... it's my 3rd time when i order to go and the server forgets to provide these things",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"This is one of my favourite restaurants near campus. The atmosphere, decor, and service have always been nice over the past ~5 years. They always brought complimentary tea, beansprouts, and miso soup regardless of what was ordered. In terms of their menu, their items are more affordable than a lot of the other Japanese restaurants (perhaps comparable to some campus food places). Their quality may not be the best in Edmonton but they definitely make it up in the price and quantity. Their ramen, assorted sashimi, chirashi, udon, bento set (lunch and dinner), and grilled salmon/hamachi are all worth a try.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"This is a solid bet for lunchtime sushi or even dinner during the week. (make reservations on date nights as it gets busy)

I personally love the Maximite Roll (Max something ...) - it's spicy and a nice mix of fish. If you order a half roll you don't have the option to go half-rice (which I like to do in order to lessen the guilt of carb-consumption)

Give the Hurricane rolls a try...also another fave.

Lastly, a solid choice is Isobe.  It's sashimi wrapped in seaweed like a roll and I think it's quickly deep fried as it has a tempura-esque finish to the outside. Delicious and always fresh.

The only thing holding back a five star here is they go really heavy on the rice on all rolls. Like, really heavy. 
They do offer a brown rice and quinoa option though, which I have yet to try.

Service is always friendly and prompt.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"A good choice for a quick meal in the University area.

The food here is incredibly consistent - I've been here countless times through the years, both in its current location and the previous spot two doors down. It's not the best sushi in Edmonton but certainly not the worst either.

However, I was not impressed with the service on my most recent visit. I showed up just before 9 p.m. on a Monday night for a late dinner. Everyone seemed to be hurrying up to get out of there (despite being open until 10 p.m.)

Our server couldn't recommend a bottle of sake (except pointing at one and saying, ""it burns"") and later appeared annoyed when I asked to have our plates changed between eating tempura and sushi. (Maybe I'm anal retentive, but I don't like different sauces mixing on my plate.)

The food itself is good. The assorted tempura is crispy, if a little on the dense side, and the fish is of good quality and reasonable portions. They also include complimentary bowls of miso soup.

Bonus points for having aji (Spanish mackerel) on their regular menu - one of my favourites but sometimes hard to find.

The uniform pricing for nigiri sushi also makes it simple to choose - toro over plain tuna is a no-brainer!

Whenever I'm in the area, I seem to keep coming back. However, I really hope this hiccup in service is an anomaly.

$60 for two people including a bottle of sake.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I order take out from here quite often since I live pretty much next door. I am impressed with the quality of their rolls and the fresh taste. I pretty much always get the isobe roll, and the Kyoto special roll is a real treat. I have eaten in the restaurant and though the space is nice and classy, the service is very slow. I will always be a fan of their take out though.  I do wish they would put a menu somewhere online....",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I've been coming here since it occupated the space phobulous has now. They've expanded and haven't looked back. 
The owners wife is always around and works hard, recognizes the regulars.

Lunch bento is all I ever come here for.
I always go for Bento D. (Beef/chicken/tempura) and an order of the Mexican maki.
I usually add a little soy sauce to the tempura dipping sauce. Beef is a flavourful teriyaki, much like a saucy Korean bulgogi. Chicken is a deep fried cutlet with a ribbon of teriyaki reduction. Crispy, very good. 
Best tempura in the city hands down - unlike most places their chef/cook actually ribbons the tempura with batter while it's being fried in order to produce the appropriate results. Meals are usually introduced with a mustard vinaigrette bean sprout salad and miso soup. 

One of the few places in Edmonton that I'll happily give a 5/5 (for the lunch hour, anyway).
Great portions and prices.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"The sublime taste of truly fresh salmon sashimi dipped in soy sauce and wasabi is a great experience that I yearn for on a daily basis.  At kyoto, I can say this once more .. the sashimi is decent.  It's certainly not the best I've had .. but it's so nice! 

Kyoto's on 87th ave and a 109th st is a good, spacious Japanese restaurant.  The menu is large with inviting pictures to make any patron a fan!  I've tried the chicken teriyaki once and found it to be decent.  However, I would say that the sashimi is really what's so great about this place! 

The assorted tempura order is quite big so don't get it is just two people sharing it and if you plan to have a buttload of sushi too (I've made that mistake twice now!).  I'm not discouraging people from the tempura - it's still very yumm!!

In general, the prices are very reasonable (roughly $30 a person) .... of course, beer and sak√© are available.  Expect to have a decent time at this sushi place.  Of course, given its location, it seems like a great dinner getaway after a movie at the Garneau.  I find the location useful, given that I work on the U of A campus.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I am a fan of both Kyoto locations, but despite working nearby come to this one less often and this is mainly because of the parking.

As with the other location, the nigiri and rolls are good, but the stars are the tapa-like starters and side dishes.  The squid care aga (lightly breaded deep fried squid strips) are usually worthwhile, oysters and scallops misonaise also very good.  

The best deal is to get a bento box at lunch for less than $10 and it comes with mi-so soup and a bean sprout salad with great sesame oil dressing.

I like the tetami rooms, but reserve ahead if you want one.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Awesome Rainbow roll, it's my go to. Quick walk from the University. I'd say it's the best Japanese in the campus area. The gyoza and miso is great as well. Always great service and I've never had a problem with parking, even in this busy location. The atmosphere is very authentic and quiet even when busy.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I've never had Japanese food before, well maybe a few pieces of sushi, so going to this restaurant was a real eye opener! I immediately loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, it was very calm and classy and the servers were incredibly responsive and professional. 

Although afterwards it was clear I was not a fan of Japanese food, I still had a wonderful time. It helped that I was with great company but in addition, the atmosphere and impeccable service. 

If you're a fan of Japanese food, or would like to try it out, this is the place to do it. The prices are also quite reasonable and the amount of food provided is impressive.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
Pretty good Izakaya fare. Gomae was great. Tempera yams yummy. Gyoza very good. Udon great,Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Went to the downtown location restaurant. The food was great, affordable and it's close by institutions. My friends and I got to sit on the private rooms because there were 6 of us. The only problem I had with this restaurant is the staff. On one of our visits, the waitress charged me for a sushi roll that I never got. Realizing this, I told the waitress and in the end she blamed us for it. After that visit, I didn't hold much of a grudge but everytime we come back there, the same waitress ignores our table and treats us like we aren't customers. Please review this with staffing",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"When I first went there years ago, it was ""alright"". Kind of pricey, even for sushi. But now, it's an amazing experience. It's almost like an urban sushi place. You go in, slap down $20-$25 for an amazing meal of higher quality Sushi. Definitely recommend it for friends hanging out or that all important first date.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Oops - refiling this under the right Kyoto location :)

I was puzzled why Eric F. had a FTR since I remembered writing on this place in June 2009!

I remember this when it was the smaller, less renovated version a couple of doors down.  This is the first time I've been back since I left Edmonton a couple of years ago... in the reno'ed space, there are much nicer tables and decor with a few tatami rooms.

Service is still consistent and food comes at a good pace.  The menu has gotten a bit larger since I was last here and offers a selection of smaller combos and bento boxes for lunch, and options to order udon, cooked meat dishes, sushi/sashimi boats, rolls and sushi by the pair.  Miso soup is complimentary.  Today I had the negitoro, aji (spanish mackerel) and unagi.

Selection of fish has improved from the last time I was here and quality is okay.  I am a sushi snob and it satisfies a craving - Vancouver is still the go-to place, but Kyoto brings back good memories of my university years and is A-OK.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I like this Kyoto location. It's definitely not the best sushi I've ever had nor the best sushi in the city, but the food is solid. Add in the cheap prices when compared to other sushi places in the city (including being cheaper than the downtown location) as well as the good service, and I find myself returning here often for my sushi fix and usually leaving satisfied. The lunch bento boxes and sushi/maki combos are some of the best value you'll ever see at a sushi restaurant, so check them out. My only complaints are that parking can sometimes be hard to find and that lately tempura crumbs seem to be popping up as an ingredient in more and more rolls, likely as a substitute for more expensive ingredients; I like having that crunch in a roll but when I order three different kinds of rolls and they all crunch, it gets old fast.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"This will be our go to location from now on. Much better than the Argyll location. The service was a bit lacking, but the food was delicious and we don't need much attention. They even made me a yam maki roll (recommended by a friend), even though it's not on the menu. IT WAS YUMMY!! The beef in their Bento box was a little tough, but for the most part we were happy with our meal.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"So far this is the best sushi that I have in Edmonton. The fish was really fresh and well presented. It also was a decent price for what you are getting. The menu is huge with a ton of selection. The decor is even quite cute. They have a traditional table area where you remove your shoes and sit on small pillows with a low table. 

Only bad thing was that our server was quite slow and we had informed her that we were in a rush - but again it was quite busy that night and I don't know how many tables she might have had.

The parking isn't even bad for the location as they do have a small parking lot in the front of the building. It was quite busy when I went here on a Wednesday evening. I would go again!",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"This place is good, clean and delicious in a calm, quite atmosphere. Shared parking to little Cesar's but don't let the outside fool you. This little restaurant is actually worth your time to try. I get ramen each time and have t been disappointed.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Kyoto is my most visited Japanese restaurant. I eat here for lunch and dinner at least a few times a month. It's the place I go when I'm looking for a casual no fuss sushi place. There may be places with better sushi in Edmonton but this will always be the one I visit the most. The food is always satisfying and the price is reasonable enough that you can come here a few times a week. They also have the best valued bento boxes for lunch in the city. 

The owner also holds her service staff to a high standard so you can always expect them to be friendly and efficient. If not, they most likely will get the boot and you probably won't see them on your next visit.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
The quality of the food and speed of service isn't consistent with their downtown location. Sashimi pieces weren't cut all the way or were ripped. Also the bowl of rice was dry.,Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"My favorite Japanese restuarant in town. With a great variety of sushi, sashimi, maki, dons and Japanese grill, it has all sorts of exotic fish and does not disappoint vegetarian people. Salads are amazing too. The sashimi is always fresh. Salmon belly is my favorite. The price is reasonable. If you want to have a Japanese style private room, call them in advance for reservation. The service is OK but could be better.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Went with a colleague over lunch, but I've come for lunch and dinner many, many, times. The quality is great, the fish is fresh and the recipes are authentically Japanese. As someone who lived in Japan a couple of years I can say this takes me back! The agadashi tofu is incredible and the isobe roll melts in your mouth! A lunch bento is good value and so is a shared sushi dinner among friends. The place is child friendly too, and good for groups. Kyoto is a staple of Japanese cuisine in the city and I always enjoy my meal here.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Lunch was pretty sub-standard. 
Ordered a Bento C Sushi and Teriyaki Chicken. Also a Bento D Beef, Chicken and Tempura. The Bentos come with a side salad. Dressing was very salty and just tasted of soy sauce. Tempura was oily and the batter was chewy. Teriyaki chicken looked like it was made ahead of time and just reheated. The batter was dried out so it was very crunch and hard to chew. What little chicken there was inside though was moist. Sushi was just ok. Tuna smelled fishy and was warm. Salmon was fresh.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Nice large restaurant with private rooms and quick service. I've been coming here for years and it's always consistently good.  I've had nearly everything on the menu and I keep heading back for the chirashi bowl (lots of fish and superb value, especially at lunch) and that sesame sauce. If you find yourself with a bowl of steamed rice make sure you order a side of that stuff. You won't be disappointed.  Every once in a while I'll get stuck with a piece of red tuna that has dried out to the texture of sawdust but I'm willing to overlook it so long as they aren't out of sesame sauce.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I was here with a group of colleagues for work & had a (weekday) dinner here. Our group comprised of every possible culture you can think of.

There are plenty of sushi restaurants but this location is nice because it's nice and close to where we need it to be .
The location is right by the University of Alberta campus, right beside the remedy Cafe.closer to Whyte Avenue, although if you just crossed the bridge across the river valley you can reach downtown very quickly.there is plenty of parking in the back, if you happen to not find enough parking in the front right near the door of the restaurant.  we were lucky and found a parking spot right by the door :)

I like the variety and I like the atmosphere.we were sitting in the corner booth with the benches where you could choose to Kneel or just sit normally. I also like the skylight so you can see outdoors.

We ordered quite a bit of food and I especially enjoyed the sushi boat. the soup was pretty good the tea was standard.most importantly, the food was fresh.the fish was excellent.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Kyoto represents that slice of Japanese cuisine which features misoshiru soup, sashimi, sushi & maki rolls, don buri (rice bowls), udon, bento, tonkatsu (a favorite), and a staggering number of appetizers (from gomae (a wilted spinach salad with sesame) to beef tataki to tako yaki (grilled Osaka-style octopus balls festooned with paper-thin bonito flakes).

What it offers it does very well, and the hunnybunny and I have visited numerous times (and done take-away even more) because it's very near to us. Their fare is satisfying and presented straightforwardly. Perhaps a touch pricey, but we don't walk away feeling cheated.

What I really like to do is start here and halfway through head across the street to Kabuki, which offers similar fare with a different take on the presentation. It's the best part of a soy sauce pub crawl :-) and makes for an interesting date night!",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Worst sushi I've ever had. Worse than all you can eat sushi. The fish is gross, the rolls are terrible. They fall apart. It's not good sushi at all.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"It's a little different compare to the other location in downtown Edmonton.
You may not feel consistency about the services and the menus.
The quality of the food is good. The menu is different. I like the staff at downtown location better. Overall it's a good place to go.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"So, I walked into Kyoto and ordered an order of California rolls and a miso soup to go. When the hostess passed on my order to the sushi chef in the back he came out looking annoyed. When I got my rolls, I opened the box and found that they were all deformed. But, the miso soup was nice. I won't return unless i'm invited by a friend.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"This place isn't bad. I went in late one afternoon to get a takeout Mexican and rainbow roll. They got it ready for me in about 20 minutes (longer than the 5 they said it would take...). They were really nice and gave me lots of extra soy sauce, wasabi, and some containers to mix it up in on the go when I asked for it. The fish was fresh and the rolls were tasty but they weren't rolled up very tightly and so they kept falling apart when I tried to dip them in the soy sauce. This was especially a problem with the tempura flakes in the Mexican roll.. 
The price wasn't bad for the quality (compared to other, worse places around town) - I think it was about $8 per roll and they were 8 big pieces each. Kyoto does the job in a pinch.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
Love this place! Best sushi I've had in Edmonton. Great atmosphere and service was really good (especially for Edmonton). Busy on weekend nights though - always had a reservation and sometimes still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.,Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I came here for lunch yesterday and today. This place is one if my favorite restaurants because of its consistency!! I always get a lunch bento (good value for $12) and it always comes out fast and delicious. Yesterday I had sashimi and tempura and today I had sashimi and teriyaki chicken. I could honestly eat here every day. Highly recommended! The parking situation can suck though, especially on Fridays at lunch! Make sure you get here before noon and make a reservation.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"One general rule a friend and I developed after living in Japan is that places named after cities/towns in Japan are usually not very good at providing an authentic Japanese meal or experience...yes, Tokyo Express I'm looking right at you! 

Fortunately, Kyoto breaks that generalization and provides a good meal at an affordable price with nice ambience. 

The bento boxes are fairly priced ($12.50 IIRC) and have decent portions. It's also nice that they give everyone miso soup and bean sprout salad after you sit down. I'm a big fan of their donburi dishes - the oyako-don in particular, which has lots of tender tonkatsu, eggs, mushrooms and rice. 

If I have a complaint about Kyoto it's that the parking lot is small and cramped, but you can't have everything I guess.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Kyoto has a very diverse menu of all sorts of maki, sushi, sashimi, along with other Japanese cuisine. Everything, even the most exotic sashimies are fresh and nicely decorated. When there is chef specials don't hesitate to try them. I got never disappointed trying new stuff. The service and the price are totally acceptable, especially when compared to other sushi places in town.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
I really like the atmosphere of this place. A little more upscale feeling than your typical sushi place. The rolls and sushi tasted fresh but nothing that really excited my palate. My favorite sushi spot in town is I Love Sushi (fitting name..),Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"A fine Japanese cuisine. First time when I went to there is just amazed me, but after about 4 or 5 times, I found the menu is just short of selection. The should give some variation to customs. But anyway, the sashimi is fresh, sushi is tasty.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Typical Sushi Chain, You should not expect anything special. Standard, boring quality.",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"I've consistently liked the food here over the years I've been coming, and certainly no complaints about the service or ambiance. 

My one complaint is that they have two locations on the same street, albeit far apart. 

""Hey come meet me a Kyoto""
""which one""
""The one on 109 Street""
""Oh, I know that one, see you there""

* Waiting at separate restaurants",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"If you need a sushi fix before hitting a movie at the Garneau, Kyoto is waiting for you.  We usually head to his place when in the neighbourhood for a film and the line-up at the Sugar Bowl is too long.  While not my go-to sushi pick, Kyoto does a great job with the whole ""raw fish"" experience.  

Last time there, we went with an assorted plate so that we could have good sample of what they have to offer.  What we got was plentiful (for the price) and a nice mix of the offerings.  The fish/seafood was fresh and tasty (you KNOW when you get a bad piece - amiright or amiright) and and plated nicely with the rice.

We had mentioned that we were catching a movie and the friendly, attentive waitress made sure we were served fast - so kudos to Kyoto for serving up a quick and delicious sushi fix!",Cr-uaPrfvG7tvqzLGAGErA
"Hudsons Pub is a staple I go to with my volleyball team for after game drinks since they are one of the bars that gives specials to all players in the ESSC. The staff have always been friendly and check in on us regularly to make sure we are good to go.The atmosphere can be lively or subdued depending when you go. If there is an Oilers game, it is usually packed since they show the game. They also offer food and drink specials during the game -  local tap beer is $4.75 a pint and there wings are 1/2 off. This was the case last night. 

I came here last night to partake in Paint Nite. It was held in the back of the pub in a closed off section so we were not interrupted by the load cheers and moans. It is a nice cozy space but maybe not the most ideal for the event since it is difficult to see the instructor.  We still had a good time and the staff were great.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"My favs at this place are their peach margaritas and their chocolate peanut butter fried dough dessert. Sooo good.

Its a great happening place to watch a hockey game too. 

Only cons I have experienced is when the staff say the ""blender is broken"" and that you feel like you are sitting in the road with a bunch of fumes when on their patio. lol. I wish they could have a rooftop patio like O2s!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"We went here to watch the grey cup.  As a sports bar, it is very good.   Lots of TV's, so not a bad spot in the place.   The wings, nachos, and beer were all great.  They had some original wing flavours.  We has maple bacon.  Which I found were not as good as they sounded, but my freind liked them.  They could use a bit more variety of beer on tap, but we found an amber ale we liked.  And finally, everything was very speedy eventhough the place was busy.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"This business will continue to do well, simply because of the real estate. It has a great location. But because of this, they serve mediocre food and give horrible service and probably keep getting away with it. The food is standard bar fare, nothing special. My meal was super greasy and salty and I felt very bloated afterwards. Service is very poor. The food took a long time to come out even though the restaurant was practically empty and lots of servers standing around.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"should own stock in the place with how much money I have spent here!!

been here since it was first renovated many years ago-it has since been re-hauled well over a year ago-to much fan fare and improvemnent.-this is the best bar so far on whyte for good food, and bar service is always pretty good. 

I like the salt and pepper wings the best, they have other daily specials which are all good. The patio in the summer is only good late at night-when it is not too busy, and there aren't hundreds of cars pulling up to the light to stare at you. I'm not into gasoline paparazzi.

Once in a while you get a waitress who will ask for your credit card so you can place your food or drink order-hey waitress get a different job-you cant possibly have been a dine and dash victim that many times!!!

I always refuse to give my CC and just (pay up front) and then don't tip out more than 1 dollar-. Like I said they should know me by now-my bill always get paid here with a generous tips.

I really like the nachos, and the steak dinner is a nice cut for what they charge. They have soup specials which are tasty, and I like there salads.

I also like the crowd that comes here, only occasionally do you get a loud screaming group of girl's I guess they cant believe the bar actually let them in :) 

My favourite thing is to watch an old couple who comes out to this place on 'date night' or something and don't realize how loud its gets-and the woman-usually looks annoyed. Fun times is why I always return. Hey bartender I'll have another!!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"It was a Saturday night and after trying 6 other places Hudson's was the only place that could seat us and feed us straight away.. 
we got a booth which if my favourite kind of seating lol.. our waitress was busy but super friendly and attentive throughout our time there. 
It's a simple menu comfort food type I got the Cajun chicken sambo and some sweet potato fries it was tasty and the bread was nice and fresh. My partner got shepards pie and he thought the same tasty. We were not blown away but it was good pub grub which is expected from Hudson's.
Our server suggested we stay or call back for drinks because it was 50% off booze on a Saturday night in Hudson's. That is a pretty cool deal!!!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"There's not a lot to say about Hudson's on Whyte, because it's just Hudson's. It looks the way Hudson's looks and serves the things Hudson's serves and after two beers is indistinguishable from The Pint and On The Rocks and all the other pubs in Edmonton. This is just how Edmonton does pubs. Nevertheless, we go to Hudson's because it IS how Edmonton does pubs and since we are from Edmonton, we like that sort of thing. I have no complaints about this bar, but nothing to rave about it either. Hudson's is homey and tiresome, like your hometown is. You go there and complain that you should be somewhere else, but secretly you love the comfort of familiarity. Both of my younger sisters are servers at another location, and it treats them well, so I appreciate that. Thank you Hudson's, for being you, like a McDonald's for grown-ups.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Just a disclaimer to start this off, as a teetotaler my review has absolutely nothing to do with the alcohol. Also, I was provided vouchers for free food, but I try not to let this affect my review. 

I have come here twice for the food, mainly chicken wings. Their traditional Caesar wings is great, it has excellent flavour even if it is a bit greasy, and the servers are kind enough to provide little wet wipes for that. Their honey garlic wings are quite nice too! And they both come with a nice side of celery and dip, which pairs quite well.
As a teetotaler I've only tried their sodas, but it's quite a nice touch that the sodas are bottomless and very reasonably priced. I expect this is to promote sensible and sober driving. 

My main recommendation is to try to come in when it's less busy - the noise levels can quite easily get out of hand in this place, and the servers are very attentive when the place isn't too packed.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Our bartender Dan was as efficient as he was handsome. Always have a good time here! Good food, good drinks and most importantly awesome staff!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Although this location always draws a large crowd, I fail to see the reason why.

Service is a little iffy, but the staff tend to be fairly friendly and conscientious. The bartenders can be abrupt at times (asking for a soda or water can get you a major stink eye on a busy night).

Food here is bland, overlooked, and boring. Very much what you would expect from a bar. Their salads sound good on the menu but are now where near as nice in reality! Fries are usually on the burnt side... Their only saving grace is their nachos.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Was here a couple years ago and service was terrible.  Came back as it was cold out and needed a place to grab a quick drink.  Service was great, the place seemed clean, refills kept coming and the vibe was perfect.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"This must be the best pub / club in Edmonton. 

Best looking patrons who know how to have a good time. 
Somewhat classier and maybe a LITTLE older crowd than some of the other places.
SUPER delicious food 
Great DJ. After 10:00 (it basically turns from a pub into the best nightclub in Edmonton.)
Dance floor is PACKED with beautiful people after 10:00 PM.
Very cordial staff that keep the customers safe and keep the riff raff out. 
This has to be the best bar in Edmonton. 
Probably the best patio in the city (right on Whyte Ave)

I've been to all the clubs and pubs and this is my favourite by far",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
Nice bar to watch sports at since they have a lot of tvs. I didn't have any food or beer so i'll reserve my final judgement till my next visit. I guess since I will be back here that says enough!,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I like this Hudson's, but it is much more ""clubby"" than the other Hudson's.

It does hold the best Hudson's patio in Edmonton, it is great for people watching, and it is also covered so it can shield you against rain (I for one love to sit on patios in the rain -- as long as I am covered).

Food and drinks here are great, just like other Hudson's, but after 7pm on a Friday, this place turns from a great place to relax, eat and down a beer, to a place to dance and get drunk.

Go for a cold beer here in the afternoon, or for a shot and a dance party at night!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Oh, Hudson's.

I WANT to give you a better review. I WANT to like you as a destination. But there's just so much you do that others do much, much better.

First off, the food is... okay. Acceptable. It hits the spot in a pinch... but I wouldn't exactly call it comfort food. The menu is pretty eclectic too - a strange mix of pub-grub and restaurant fare. It's not often you come across a place that has a chicken-wing special and a steak dinner on the same menu. I'm not sure if that's a point for, or against.

The service is... also acceptable. Every time I've been the waitresses have been friendly and helpful, but also distracted. A little too busy, maybe? Regardless, they weren't around often enough to check on drinks, or to take orders and we're left waiting for some longish periods. Moreover, the food takes quite a while to come out. This is not a place you want to go for a quick meal on a busy night. That said, last time I did lunch at Hudson's, the service and food were snappier - so maybe it's an evening thing.

The worst though - Hudson's doesn't accept debit. That's actually a huge deterrent for me. I don't usually carry cash, and I don't want to use your crappy ATM that costs me an extra $2.50. 

If you don't want to accept my debit card, then you don't want my money or my patronage.

I say good-day Hudson's on Whyte.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Let's celebrate pride weekend with friends and beer, this place is awesome for wings ( Wednesday) food it's  and prices are ok too, music really chill you will have a good time here",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"This was my second time here. The first time was a few years ago while traveling for work in Edmonton. They first time wasn't very memorable I guess but I did remember this place because of the great location and cold beer.

When we first came in there was nobody to seat us or point us in the right direction so after asking the bartender we seated ourselves. After taking a seat at our table of choice we waited about 15 minutes before getting any service. The server finally came after I complained to the bartender. It was easy to forgive our waitress because she was smoking hot. Once we got service it was fine thereafter. Very friendly and attentive.

As for the food, the wings were the special of the day and they had multiple flavoring options. When asked if I get a couple different flavors in one order I was told I could not. I understand it is a pain for them but I still think them not doing it is kind of petty. Anyways, no big deal. As far as the wings go they were pretty dang small but very tasty.

I would come back in the future if I was in the area and didn't know where to eat at. Overall though not the best experience I've ever had at a Pub like eatery.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I ordered something to go. I paid about $20 for the order, get home and open it to be gravely disappointed. Brown wilted lettuce, barely any ingredients and 3 pieces of shrimp. Now I know why they call it angry shrimp salad...",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"They are having a promotion, anytime the temp hits over 23 you get a free order of wings. So it was packed when I met up with my wife and some friends and we had a booth which was rare, but they got there early. 

With it being as busy as it was, I can understand that service is going to be hit, so I can't fault them too much. But my wife had to ask numerous times for her water, not once did it have the lemon that she requested. They didn't have enough napkins at the table and had to wait a while for them as well. 

The wings were good, they've added some new flavours, the maple bacon was amazing!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"My friend recommend we come here after our run for a late lunch.The place was nearly empty, however we went in the middle of the afternoon on a wednesday. The waitress was nice and informative, but the service was slow. I had the perogies & sausage and we also split the bacon donuts. The Perogies & Sausage were delicious but it was so greasy i ended up having stomach problems for the rest of day. The donuts were really tasty but extremely sweet.
 Overall the ambience is there,but the food did not work for me & the service was slow despite only having 3 tables full. I would give it another shot & order something else.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"WING WEDNESDAY...this is the place...fantastic wings the size of your fist. Service is awesome, the wait staff friendly and not too bad on the eyes ;) , I usually head out here on Friday nights too, fun atmosphere and usualyy not to much trouble.

"I could leave my AMAZING review in a 140 character tweet ( see previous HUDSON'S SOUTH COMMON REVIEW FOR THE LAUGH)

So me and Samson C. Came out for the Hudson's 1 cent wing bonanza. We were SORELY disappointed by Hudson's south common but we are INCREDIBLY impressed by Hudson's on Whyte.

We walked in at 9:15pm, place is BUMPIN', there were so personable, so efficient, we were seated right away.

BOOM, order 2 $5 beer and 10 wings a piece.
BOOM, they're here. The beers are cold, the wings are hot, as they should be. 

The staff ARE BUSTING THEY'RE ASS#S.

It's all gravy.  You might wait for a bit but Hudson's on Whyte 1 cent wing is killing it 

They're not packing us in like sardines. The staff is BEYOND competent. A manager even popped by to check on us. 


It's everything you need on a Wednesday 1 CENT WING NIGHT.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Like the other Hudson's just not very good.

Service is OK, food is OK and well the beer is local.

On Whyte there are so many places to try, why settle for something so mediocre.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Great place to watch the game.  Better beers than most sports pubs.  
Better food, for sure.  Bison shepherd's pie.  Delicious.
I was greeted by 3 staff as I walked in.  Given plenty of attention.   When I had an issue with my dish, the server got one of  the managers right away.  He was genuinely concerned and settled the matter immediately.  Very impressive.  Very friendly servers.  
Loads of TV screens everywhere.  Always a good view.
Bathrooms were clean.
I only wish that the smoke from the outdoors would not waft in to asphyxiate me.  
On Friday and Saturday, it turns into a dance club after 9:00 or so.  This is kind of inconvenient when you are with a table full of friends and you are asked to move so they can rearrange the furniture.  Besides, I hate dance music.
Other than that, it's a great place to have in the neighbourhood.
Wednesdays have half price wine until 6:00pm which is sort of dumb, because I don't drink wine before 6:00pm.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"This place is the closest bar to my friends apartments so we end up here often. There is usually a line up to get in on the weekends between 9:00pm and 11:00pm but it's kind of fun to wait and people watch. The bouncers are always quick checking ID's and are super friendly. 
Once you get in the lay out of this place is a little strange, there are 2 rooms upstairs and the bathrooms are in the basement. The large bar in the middle makes it easy to get drinks and there are always a ton of bar tenders so you usually aren't left waiting.
The music here is always only okay, they repeat songs a lot and don't shift between songs well. The dance floor is small and the new set up basically turns three tables into a dance floor hallway area. 
The food here is super hit or miss; I love their wings, burgers, and sweet potato fries but their nacho's are seriously lacking in cheese which is kind of the point of nachos (and they're 18:00$). 
I prefer the other locations (downtown, south common, WEM) over this one.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Always a good time!! Wing Wednesday 39 cent wingz! $5 dollar house beers and wine. My favorite beer is the lumberjack, light and crisp! 
Hudsons is one of my most frequent spots! Located in the heart of whyte ave this location gets crazy on the weekend and game nights!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I love this place. It was recommended by some friends as a great place to watch the game and it certainly is. There are TV's everywhere, they have an excellent choice of beers on tap, and the food is great. The biggest difference was how the staff that took care of us. Special thanks need to go out to Danielle and Kennedy for providing us with exceptional service.Right about the time we needed something they were always there.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I went in the server was really nice think they picked me a winner, the lady was in her mid 40, I think and good with people Megan i think her name was.. Lots of energy i could tell by her just moving around and talking to everyone at tables to see if there doing alright.. She stops by mine and ask what would you like sir or something like that and saying how she got my table as well.. I was happy..  gave me a few options like the Nachos and  Caesar, what was the special of day.. kind of wanted the Caesar but looked at the menu before going and wanted something different.. 

I was really hungry so i wasn't really my self.. She was OK  with my strong attitude toward her felt like i could be confident  but failed at it, ended up ordering a water, she just said alright so you want a water and i said strong something.. she said the what?..  Alright let me look for you and see what we have.. So i was like alright here it is its the Strongbow.. *laughs* thought it would go good with the burger i was about to have.. 

I said alright can you eat at this time of time? She said ""yes you can eat till 12:00 if you like.."" I laughed felt a little embarrassed.. I said i have  card of some sort, she wasnt sure.. she just said want me to give a few to decide i am like alright.. found it just as she left..

She came back, I said alright so what one of these should i choose ""All-Canadian or Double Bacon BBQ Burger"" she said the Double bacon BBQ burger is awesome, I said alright so i will try that and she said do you want the Bison Patty for a dollar extra, i said sure.. picked the Poutine fries as well.. She said do you want me to add your card to your bill i said sure let do that.. 

She left, I wait a bit and looked around found out that the TV was a bit too loud and it prob isnt the best place for a date, you normally take a girl to a quit place were she and you can get to know each other not to a place were your looking at the ball game, she the centre of subject.. Eyeing the couple in-front of me seems like there hitting it off even though the guy is really paying more attation to game then the cute girl who is having a date with.. just felt it was funny.. ether way back to watching the game and waiting for my drink.. 

After a few she came back and put the drink on my table and water.. she said your burger should be out in a few.. i said Sorry if i was rude to you, she said dont worry about it your not rude, you are fine.. i like this waitress already.. smiled and said thank you.. enjoy your drink.. 


I sipped the Strongbow, have to say this is my first time trying one of these felt like it wasnt my cup of tea due to not tasting really like cider more like beer.. should of picked the Caesar i told my self.. Ether way i finished it with my burger by the end and water..

Ended up getting the burger in time, felt the burger was really good the iceburg was prob the worst part they could of went with a Romaine lettuce to make a little less lettuce on the bun.. it was a bit sloppy thankfully there was a few serviettes to clean my self with.. the Poutine was really good had real curds!! 

Ended up eating everything and asking for the bill at the end, cleaning up my stop before i left so the waitress didn't have to pick up very much, she handed me a debt machine thought to my self there prob not paying her minimum wage lets give her about 50% of a tip what is a bit high showing my bill was only like $7.50, I tipped her like $3.50 figured it wasnt a high tip.. She said thank you and have a good day.. 

I left and felt like it was a great night.. 

Pro: Server was good, food was good, drinks were good and good options, and clean place, waitress let me by not just cut in-front of me, good manners and fun to be around. 
  
Con: Loud ball game, Lettuce on burger..",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
Not overly impressed with this place. Ordered the fish and chips. I was served an undercooked soggy battered fish.  Fries were ok. Girlfriend had the chicken sandwich which ended up being overcooked and dry. Horrible service. Waited for almost 20 minutes for the bill after the table was cleared. Total cost with 2 pints around $50. Just a bad customer experience in general. Not sure if I would go back there if they were giving the food away.,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
This is a very busy pub to people watch at.   I came here with my fam to check out Whyte Ave and this is one of the busiest pubs on the strip.   The nachos here are huge!   And the beer selection is ok.   They have a very large patio section which goes around the corner.  I would come back here just for that.,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"By far the worst experience I've had anywhere,     Considering sexual harassment was involved. Not by a guest may I add, by the manager himself and a bouncer. 

  Last Friday my friends and I were excited to go out considering most of them live in BC where the legal age is 19 and they are 18. For their first night out we decided to head to whyte! Somewhere I've always enjoyed. Hudson's used to be my first stop when going out to whyte. We get there and it was decently quiet, not yet to crazy so after a lonnng Uber drive of around 45 minutes, of course all of us girls had to pee considering we had been pre drinking before the Uber. We head to the bathroom , me and 5 of my other girl friends. So 3 of us share a stall and two share another and one other alone. As most girls know this isn't uncommon when going out with friends. Anyways my friend has to take off her body suit so we turn around and she has no bra so is topless at this point and I hear these two men outside our stall. They had followed us into the girls washroom because we looked suspicious going to the bathroom together! SORRY A GIRL HAS TO PEE. Anyways, they yell as I look out the door for us to get out so obviously we get scared and they start to bang on the door reefing it open and seeing my friend topless. A few of us quickly leave confused about what had just happened and go upstairs only to be dragged downstairs for them to check our bags. Which had absolutely NOTHING In them as the manager admitted to my friends father on the phone. He had told him that he has a video of us all going into the bathroom. So? And my friends dad asked him if he had a video of him going in there to, his response was that he will erase it. Disgust. He continued to repeat that he was the manager and can do whatever he wanted. Get off your high horse buddy, you are a manager at Hudson's. nothing more. That gives you NO RIGHT to violate a females privacy. Absolutely disgusted by their actions. Despicable",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
Poor poor service. I'm taking business and do skip the dishes and when other couriers think they deserve a tip and don't accept orders because customers don't tip. I get left over with an order that's 2 hours late. NOT a single person looked at me and they all waited for the manager to come and accuse me of being 2 hours late. Who in their right mind would take that long and waste their own time ? Very poor practice on the night managers part and especially everyone else who pretended I didn't exist.,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I would give negative stars if I could. J visited their pub and got a tab. When I left i paid my tab  and everything was good. I forgot my card i left with them but realized right away. When u went back to check they waved me 9ff saying I was wrong. I add no no way to get home. They did have my card. They found it right away in my 3rd call
My card is still cancelled I'm still fucked.

Hudsons is shit 

I am consulting legal advice",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"We popped in here during the Fringe and the staff was working hard, as the place was slammed. That said, I had to wonder about the management, having only one bartender and one server working late-night during the neighborhood festival that obviously brings decent business to the bar. It took 20-ish minutes to get menus (the server didn't notice us until my friend went to the bar to try to get a menu) and a while longer to get our orders taken, but once that was out of the way, things ran pretty smoothly. We had the nachos (sans tomatoes) and two plates of the pretzel bites and the food all came out well-portioned and hot. As a total nacho snob, I'm always impressed by what you get here (which is great because you're paying about $24).
We might have spent longer here than we were planning, but it was worth the trip and gave us extra time to catch up. We'll be back again, probably next Fringe.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"The best I can do is give this place two stars. The service was fine. The food was the blah, bland pub food you get at many chain restaurants. Started with the pile of onion rings with parmesan beer sauce. These were seved hot and pretty good. Scott had the steak sandwich special.  This is a piece of bread (not a whole roll) and a steak served on a plate. Hmmm, don't know how that constitutes a sandwich? His steak was way over-cooked and the Caesar salad side was over-dressed and soggy. I had the angry shrimp salad. I don't know if the cooks were hung-over and forgot how to make this dish but my plate was missing the black beans, corn, cilantro, green onions and had four stale tortilla chips as a garnish (see photo). Not very good and the server never bothered to ask why I did not eat my meal.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Hudson's is just a staple place to go. Whether it is the South Common, in the West Edmonton mall or the Whyte Ave location, the food is consistently fabulous. I've always had great service and the food is never less than delicious.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I usually try to avoid Hudsons but after a team win in the Edmonton Sports and Social Club, we decided to head here because they were the closest sponsors. Yes, free wings and cheap beverages which includes Molson Canadian and Coors Light. But they were out of Molson... (seriously???). Then they didn't discount the drinks on the bill until we notified the server. Food wise it seems like Hudsons has gotten a bit better but I'll still avoid this place if I can.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"So  there are a lot more interesting restaurants to eat at on Whyte Ave. The reason why we went is that they have a nice patio. And with winter coming along the way I thought we should enjoy some Whyte Ave scene outside. Really the patio is great, I wouldn't say the interior of the restaurant is anything special. Our server was great. She was quick, friendly, and helpful. Our water glasses were always filled and she was quick to check on us. The menu is okay. Generally pub food but there is something for everyone though. I am not a pub person and I went with the angry shrimp salad. My husband went with the From Scratch Burger. Food came out quick. My salad was really tasty but I am not sure if the portion or the amount of shrimp was worth the 20 bucks I paid for it. My husband said his burger was agreeable, but again probably not worth the money that he paid. In general, if you are going for a game or a nice patio sure have a few beers and if you are okay with paying slightly more for slightly less, you should be fine. I don't think I will venture her though again unless I need a nice patio.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
Let's celebrate pride weekend with friends and beer.This place is awesome for wings ( Wednesday special). The food is standard pub fare at reasonable price. music was top forty. had a good time here. The small lot fills quickly but street parking is easy to find.,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Visited this little gem off Whyte and it was a good experience. While perusing around Whyte Ave, this was the only spot that had parking close by so we visited the pub.

Started off with a cider and my friends went with various craft beers.

We got some wings and I got the All Canadian burger w/ an extra patty, egg, and a side caesar salad.

The food was fairly good, my burger was a bit dry but very delicious. And the wings were good.

Our server was very nice and informative; literarily kept the drinks coming in until the minute we left. There were definitely no thirsty folks at my table.

Happy dining, and I hope your experience is as good or better than mine if and when you do visit Hudson on Whyte.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I stopped by for the Holy Puck spiced ale but was disappointed to find out they were sold out for the season till next years winter season. This is one of my favourite places to eat wings so I stayed. Wednesday is their wing night which is 39 cents/wing after 6pm. 
 We started out with happy hour $4.00 off Campfire Poutine (see pic) which is a variation on the Canadian favourite. It has cheese curds, gravy, ground beef, bacon, tomatoes, hot sauce, sour cream and green onions. (Reg 13.25). It is probably the best poutine I've ever had in Alberta. 
At 6pm we founds some new favorite wings like sticky peanut, (subtle peanut flavoured  glaze with chopped cilantro)
regular hot and spicy sesame (mildly sweet with mildly hot). Tonight they were on their game and the wings were cooked to perfection with just the right crispiness. The service was standard. 
Hudsons, please bring back Holy Puck beer for next years Oiler season!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
Best wings and nachos by far. Ask for the salt and pepper rub to go on the chicken for your nachos and you will never go back.  Kimberly was the greatest and kept on top of our food and beverages. Great atmosphere to watch the hockey game - loud and full of Oilers fans.,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"This place gets four stars purely based on their location - Whyte Ave has always been an entertaining place to engage in people watching.

Other than that, it's a bar.  Pretty standard pub fare food, with a decent selection of locally brewed beers.

The parking situation (street only) usually doesn't cause me any grief, since I rarely go to Whyte Ave on weekends.  Seriously, you have a better chance of winning the lottery than finding a parking spot down there.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
Gets packed on the weekend. I haven't tried the food yet but the drinks were alright. Good music and lively crowd but quite too loud we had to yell at each other. Lotsa TVs. Servers are fun! Got free drinks from a server who asked to do line dance with him.,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
I had a bison burger with yam fries. Both which were good. Not exceptional but better than most bar burgers.  The house drafts are also very good and a great price during happy hour.  Service was very good as It was pretty busy.  They had the mlb playoffs on which is also a plus,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I don't like clubs, Hudson's is a good place to stop in for a drink with friends without the divey pub atmosphere or the night club experience. 
Their menu is definitely not just pub fried food, they have a pretty good diverse selection, some healthy choices. 
The Hudson's on whyte Ave is a 20-something club atmosphere on weekend nights but only because it's on whyte Ave so it's part of the bar crawl. 
They have good security, patios in the summer, and the staff is always great, I tip very well here. 
If you see a Hudson's, stop in, you'll like it. 
They have big TV's with the oilers games playing on game nights as well. 
See you there!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
I think this update is good timing considering that Hudson's on Whyte Ave since they are having their grand reopening tonight. I can't wait to see what they have done with the place because I really liked it before they closed for renovations. My second time here was during the first Oilers game of the year. This is certainly the place to feel energy on game night. My friend and I split the nachos which were HUGE. Even though the place was packed we still received really good service. Hudson's is pretty solid so I'm curious to see what they have done to make it even better.,CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"My experience with this Hudsons location comes from two very different places, so I plan to write about my first experience and then update later this weekend about my second and third.

My first experience comes from my first frazzled lunch after a day of trying to figure out my way around the U of A campus for the first time. I have to say that regardless if I am going here for lunch (this time) or drinks (following times) I have always lucked out finding parking. 

During this trip we arrived on a Wednesday around noon. There were a few tables in there, but otherwise it was fairly empty, so we basically had the servers undivided attention. Not to say that she was smothering us, but it was a good flow. 

You have your typical pub type music playing, most tables are the ones with the high back chairs (very few booths) and the decor was laid back. The menu has a good spin on typical pub type food. I ordered a rum and coke (needed a stiff drink after getting lost all morning and hey it was noon!) and decided on the mini chicken burgers. It wasn't the best choice for me per say because I hate tomatoes, so once you take those off you are left with; bun, chicken, wilted lettuce (because it is assembled when the chicken is hot) and mayo. The other mini burgers looked better and I will probably opt for those next time around.

I like Hudsons if you are trying to find some place where you can just hang out, order some good food if you want, and drink in a casual atmosphere. You always know that it will be somewhat popular because of the location and is a great starting off point if you plan to go somewhere else later in the night. More to come in further reviews!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Great friendly pub with wonderful managing staff. I came on Wednessday to catch the NBA finals on their wing night. For 39 cent wings (come in 10 per order) they were decent enough to fill you up. My companion and I ordered their whiskey barbeque, honey garlic, salt and pepper, hot, and honey-sriracha. We enjoyed all of them except honey-sriracha. The honey-sriracha does not taste sweet nor spicy. It tasted like bad cheese... would not recommend. Overall, its a nice pub in the heart of Whyte ave.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"There are not many places I give 5 star reviews to but this is one of them.( Check out my 200 plus reviews. I'll give the best in class places 5 star.  The rest fall where they deserve. Including some serious 1 star stinkers, actually Hudson's South Common is a 1 star stinker!)

Whyte Ave is a home of a million bars, and a billion places to buy booze. Why has this place destroyed the rest?

Here's why I give this name brand pub on Whyte 5 stars.

1. They are not racist or pretentious. The Hudson's in South Common gives peferentional treatment to pretty white girs, while this location does not. If you are a pretty white girl expecting better treatment and no lines this is NOT the location for you. 

2. Great Service. I know you might be expecting me to make some sort of sarcastic comment here. I'm not being sarcastic. They have great service.

3.Best Deals and Good Food. Again. While I'm seriously tempted to make some sarcastic smarty pants comment here, I can't. This location seriously treats everybody the same, AND has some of the BEST deals in the city.

Come here for the deals, stay because they treat everybody the same. The Hudson's Pub brand is different across Edmonton. Fair Warning! The Whyte avenue branch is awesome while not all of them are!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Hudsons Whyte is consistent with the chain's other locations, which is to say that it's generally good food, generally served by pleasant staff. 

The few negative experiences I've had here have been mitigated by understanding management and a desire to make things right, so I really can't complain. 

Hudsons is a great rest stop if you're strolling down Whyte and in the mood for some boneless wings or a pint!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Reasonably nice place. Service was friendly and attentive. It reminded me very much of the Hudson's downtown. The washrooms are down a flight of stairs, so unfortunately the place is not accessible for all. I only stopped in for something quick (and non-alcoholic) to drink, so there is not much more I can really say.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Another chain pub... 
went in with friends at their choosing. Poutine was way too salty, glad i only sampled some from my friends plate. He is a Quebecer and was not impressed. I had a montreal smoked meat sandwich. It was mediocre...marble rye? Was a soft rye bread which is not proper for a real montreal style sandwich. Maybe i am a little critical because my ex used to work at dunns famous deli, and i went in regularly for the real deal. Staff was kind of blahhh... no debit?? Just a cash machine. i guess they prefer to make a profit on this as well, rather than lose .25¬¢ on the interac fee...
Did i give 3 stars??? Make that a 2.5 haha...",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I look at these kind of bar chains the same way I would look at a two hour flight. As long as I arrive at my destination in decent shape I'm good! No luxury required at all, just make sure the washroom works.

One cannot expect rare craft beer or high calibre cocktails. One cannot expect rare characters the should be captured in book form. One cannot expect discussions about world events or the history of the rare scotch you are drinking. I'm in Hudson's I'm going to drink a Corona, probably do a shot of shot of crappy tequila at some point and the deepest thing going on here is likely the ""ski shot.""

Today I just wanted to look at people play pretty, dance to top 40 (new school and old school music) and hang out with friends. That is exactly what I got and Hudson's delivered. Knew what I was getting and got!",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"Great food.  Good beer selection, solid prices. Made Canada day great for my friend and I.  Do yourself a favor and sit at Marta's table you won't regret it.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"I went for lunch with a friend on Friday and decided to have their Steak Sandwich lunch special and a beer.  I sat at the bar and I ordered a rare steak.  When I got my meal it was cooked medium and marked with the plastic medium rare white flag.  I mentioned the error to whom I assume was the head bartender, he simply shrugged and said ""we have new cooks and mistakes often happen"".  No apology, discount etc.  I'm sick of paying full price for substandard service, especially when they hand you your bill and expect a premium tip.  What for?? Cooking my food wrong and being dismissive about it?  Not impressed.",CyGxCUdTRGUPKGOgzC6Zug
"We've just returned from our Valentine's Day dinner out, and this year's pick was Sofra. I couldn't have made a better choice!

I'd noticed it years ago, but when we were out, it always escaped my radar. Never again! 

Allan G and I are huge fans of all types of Greek/Middle Eastern food, so this was a treat. We'd gone to Istanbul a lot in the past, as it's very close to our house, but lately, the quality of their meats had dropped off, so we decided to try Sofra instead. We have a new favorite restaurant! 

Al had the Lamb Casserole, and I had the Pasa Kebab (pronounced Pasha). He said his got better toward the bottom, where all the juicy goodness and chunks of lamb were found (under a coating of what tasted like peppers and mushrooms). He was jealous of mine though, and wants to order it next. We both love our lamb. 

The Pasa Kebab is an amazingly succulent hunk of meat, cooked to utter perfection, with a side of grilled vegetables, bulgur wheat pilaf, and a side salad. I was in heaven. 

We weren't originally going to order dessert (I'm not a huge baklava fan), but thought we'd take a look just in case, and having been watching our intake, we promised to split whatever we picked. He wasn't choosy, just wanted to help me stay healthy. 

The Fig and Date pudding was unusual...deep and fruity, with whipped cream to cut the richness, and a bit of tangy pomegranate sauce. Al isn't a big fan of figs or dates, but exclaimed it a winner. 

Our 2 entrees, dessert, and a half litre of a fantastic Malbec came in at just under $100 before tip. It was worth every penny! 

Al already wants to return for our anniversary in July, so he can order the Pasa.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Don't judge a restaurant from the outside. The outside of Sofra is very bland, and certainly disguises the wonderful interior. I love the little Trojan horse that's just inside the door (it's big, but ""little"" compared to the size of the original).

I've been coming here for years, and the good has always been great. The kabobs are awesome (I usually alternate between the chicken and spicy beef), and come with nice sides of Bulgar and vegetables. The pita bread is absolutely amazing, and is made fresh when you place an order - it's a great appetizer (I recommend the red pepper sauce, or the hummus). There's a meal for two people that's great to get if you haven't been to the restaurant before, as you get to sample a few of the dishes.

Last night we took 6 other couples to Sofra (8 of us total) - we lucked out as a group of 8 had canceled earlier in the day (reservations on the weekend nights should be made 4-7 days in advance). The other couples absolutely loved their meals, and said they'd definitely be back again.

I knocked one star off because I feel the prices of some things are a bit expensive. Their baklava, which is absolutely delicious, sells for $8, and you get 4 small pieces. Yes, I ordered it every time I go, but it's still priced higher than it should be. I'd budget about $35-50 a person depending on whether you get alcohol and dessert.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"We went there tonight.  Not a lot of selections of wine by the glass and a nice limited food menu with some interesting selections which I like as opposed to a large menu of a lot of things that the chef can't accurately cook.  

We had the three dip bread and I really liked the (heavy on the tahini) hummus.  My friends liked the cheese dip and the pepper dip but I thought they were mediocre.  It comes with thin bread as opposed to pita so you don't fill up on bread.  I was confused as to whether the bread was supposed to be soft or crispy because it was a combination of both.

The table really liked their meat dishes (meatballs and chicken).  My tuna dish was pretty good but I thought it was a bit over cooked.  Each plate comes with grilled veggies which were good and some Bulgar which I thought was tasteless and gave to my husband to finish.

The service was friendly but they could have made more money off us by being more attentive.  

Overall, fairly good but I thought it was pricy for what you get.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Best Mediterranean food in town (grouping Greek, Lebanese and Turkish together).  My only complaint is that the baklava isn't very authentic.  It seems like something from a package.  The fig feta dip is unreal.  And they (I think) make their pita bread in house!  A very nice dining experience.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Heard a lot of good things about Sofra and glad I finally decided to try it! It may look pretty simple on the exterior, which makes the interior look quite unexpected. Burnt orange walls and dim lights everywhere, it's rustic and earthy inside. There's a big stone horse sculpture on a ledge in the centre of the restaurant, no doubt the masterpiece of the place, that resembles the legendary Trojan horse.

But enough of ambiance and decor, and onto the food! I had the shrimp casserole which was delicious. Large prawns cooked with all kinds of veggies -- tomatoes, squash, mushroom, peppers -- sitting in a slightly spicy sauce/broth, and all covered with mmm mmm melted cheese on top! Highly recommended. My friend had the chicken skewers which were really moist and tender, grilled to perfection. All entrees come with salad and rice pilaf.

Service was courteous and friendly, our waitress came by to check up on us often. They also didn't kick us out when we decided to linger a little longer to chat. A great dining experience at Sofra and I would definitely go back!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"decor is nice. Took a long time to get our appetizer though.  We ordered pita with feta dip.  The pita was fantastic: thin, with sesame seeds.  The cheese dip was okay but a bit too overpowered by the salt.  The entrees were good and those didn't take too long to come after our appetizer.   Expensive but the meats were flavourful and you get a decent amount of sides to fill you up.  Overall,  great place if you don't mind possibly waiting a while for your appetizer and paying in the $20s and $30s for your entr√©e.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
We went to this place for our anniversary. Excellent food (try the stuffed apricots) in very clean quiet environment.  Definitely be back:),EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Both times that I've enjoyed this restaurant, it's been from the same private room upstairs, perfect for parties of 6.  Dinner started with appetizers of all sorts, including the most delectable pita I have ever tasted (soft, warm and fresh) with delicious red pepper dip, hummus and a third that I don't recall.

We ordered the Sultan's feast or bazaar or something...and there was so much food but my favorite were the prawns...the size of my hand. Dessert was baklava.  All amazing, delicious, just perfect.

The wine selection was impressive for both reds and whites and some of our party went downstairs after dinner to check out a new wine room in the basement that the owner invited us to check out personally.

Service was awesome and our server had a great personality, constantly making us laugh with unexpected quips. 

Sofra is an excellent choice when you don't want to compromise on quality of food, selection, taste or service. It was a packed house when we went on a Friday night and I recommend making reservations in advance if you want to get in.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"The first time we went to Sofra, we were blown away, and our second venture there blew us away even further! One of the best gems in town, it has friendly, knowledgeable and super accommodating staff, a wonderful owner/chef who came and spoke to us both times, a great wine list, and food that we often dream about. The stuffed apricots, fresh-made pita and hummus, gigantic prawns wowed us both times, and the platter of filet mignon, swordfish, chicken, and lamb was even better than we remembered. The bulghar pilaf, grilled  vegetables, and salad added a wonderful balance to the platter of meat, and the baklava was perfection. We can't wait to go back!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"My family had a great experience here. We called only a couple of hours ahead of our arrival to make a reservation.

The staff were kind and we did not see any of the snobbishness other reviews complained about.

We ordered the Sultan's Sofrasi with appetizers and desserts included, as well as a few drinks. The meal meal took a few hours, but they had appetizers right away and we felt the meal arrived in a timely manner for the quality of the food and with lively dinner conversation.

The lamb and swordfish were definitely our favorite items. Everything was moist and flavorful. They give you large portions in the Sultan's plate, you could feed 3 people instead of 2.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Turkish cuisine might not be on the top of your list when it comes to deciding where to eat on a night out. It definitely wasn't on mine but a dinner at The Cellar at Sofra last week quickly changed that. A hidden gem, the three month old extension of Sofra in downtown's core is serving up authentic and traditional mezze (or meze), similar to the Spanish concept of tapas. As a big fan of tasting plates and small bites, this was right up my alley and thanks to my friend Lesley's suggestion, a group of us made a visit.

Sofra isn't new to Edmonton but their separate mezze menu and extensive selection of wines for their underground space is. Two distinct seating areas define The Cellar: tables amongst dimly lit mosaic lamps, creating an intimate and romantic dining experience; and the open, brightly lit area featuring none other than a set of 'sofra', low tables or trays for dining seated on the floor, with colourful seating cushions. Can you guess where we sat?

Crunchy coated peanuts started off the evening, an addictive snack that left all of us mindlessly snacking.

The Meze Tabagi: an assorted mere platter with yaprak karma, stuffed Turkish apricots, fried helm cheese, grilled black tiger prawns, and Bosnian sausage. The stuffed Turkish apricots were a favourite and I loved the smokiness of the prawns. An ideal plate for 2 - 4 diners, our group of 8 were left wanting more bites!

Lesley was our expert and guide for the night on Turkish cuisine seeing that she's been to Istanbul. We were able to order Lahmacun, a dish that wasn't on The Cellar at Sofra's menu but was available upstairs in the regular dining room. Chef and owner Yuksel Gultekin and the kitchen were so accommodating and made the dish for us. Absolutely loved the in-house flatbread and the spiced ground meat was delicious!

The Incik Kuzu, a lamb loin served on a bed of saut√©ed vegetables, in-house tomato basil sauce was cooked medium rare as per requested, and was very nicely done. I was expecting the spices to pack a punch, like a Moroccan lamb roast, and stronger notes of cumin but the dish didn't deliver that. Perhaps it wasn't meant to (I'm new to Turkish cuisine!) but we cleaned it up nevertheless.

My absolute favourite main dish of the night was the grilled beef meatballs served on a dollop of yogurt and topped with saut√©ed tomatoes, the Parmak Kofte. There's something about meatballs that's universal throughout all cuisines, a comforting dish and one that can please any palate. An absolute must order, the kofte were moist and flavourful! Mmm, I want more.

The Fume Ordek Beyti, a smoked duck breast, was cleverly plated to make a none other than, a flying bird. Paired with fresh herbs and rolled in phyllo pastry, the packages were lightly toasted in the pan and brushed with a cayenne butter mixture and cut into pieces to share. The phyllo pastry consistency was a little different from your typical phyllo dough and the bite really brought out textures that reminded me of green onion cakes, not a bad thing.

My least favourite dish was the halibut, wrapped in beef pastrami and baked with an accompanying tomato, pepper, and mushroom sauce. The Tranca Pastirimi fell flat for me compared to all the other dishes although I appreciate that there was a seafood option in the menu.

Desserts rounded out our meal, the baklava, a sweet layered pastry filled with walnuts, pistachios, and honey, were a hit for all and perfect for a sweet tooth. I absolutely loved my parfait of vanilla ice cream and caramelized figs, I could have eaten that all night!

Overall, I'm so happy to have found another small plate dining option in the downtown core! Even better, on Tuesdays any bottle of wine under $60 is half off, making that night's meal even more delightful. Good company, good food, and wine. I don't think I can ask for more. The Cellar at Sofra's strong points are I think what Turkish food would be known for, like the grilled meats, kofte, and pitas. I'm excited to come back to try the Kabak Dolma, zucchini halves filled with your choice of toppings and the Helim Peynir, thinly sliced grilled eggplant wrapped around some of that beautiful helm cheese.

Not only do I have to make another trip to The Cellar but the upstairs has a completely different menu and more catered to individual plates. So excited to have tried Sofra! Service was amazing and accommodating to all our needs. Absolutely loved the experience and can't wait to be back.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I normally hate leaving bad reviews before giving a restaurant a second and third chance but I don't think I'll ever go back here again.  
We had a party of 8 seated downstairs on a Friday night in the cushion room @ 730 pm.   5 of the party showed up early and ordered drinks.  We got them to preorder a dish for us as we were going to be 15 mins late.  Upon arriving the restaurant was mid packed.  We went downstairs and ordered drinks and food after a 30 min wait cause the server was busy.  Well fast forward 2 hours later, not even exaggerating...the time was 9:25 when we got our first dish we pre ordered in the car on the way to the restaurant.  The server was very apologetic.  We were very antsy at this point and upset.  
The platter was scarce but food was good, our prawns were stone cold.  Not worth the extra cost as the portions were tiny.  The server took off an appetizer from the bill and offered free dessert for the wait.  Well we were starving at this point so we walked to Old Spagetti Factory and enjoyed  a quick good meal.

To sum up...2 hrs wait for food, cold prawns, tiny portion size vs cost and starving.  Our meal still cost us $30 per person.

We won't be back and our group was so unimpressed they swore this place off too.  Very disappointed.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"What a meal. I had visited Turkey last year and was looking to find some of those flavours again. Sofra exceeded any expectations I had. From fantastic wine pairings (great service all around) to the best in grilled meats, this restaurant made a good dining experience, great. The chef/owner even came over to hear about my recent travels. Genuine, quality food made from scratch is what you can expect here. Te≈üekk√ºr ederim - thank you!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I love Sofra. It's probably my favourite Mediterranean + Middle Eastern food in Edmonton. The Adana kabab is amazing. The hummus is the greatest I've ever had. Their bread is all freshly made so their appetizers even better. Everything here is amazing from the appetizers to the salads to the kababs to the steak to the bakhlava. I'm not even a big fan of bakhlava but this restaurant has the best I've ever had. The turkish coffee is also to die for, be sure to try it. I just wish Sofra was less expensive and didn't require reservations so I could visit it more often. But the food is definitely worth it.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"This is without question one of the best kept secrets west of Manitoba! The food is consistently great and believe me I have eaten here more times than I can remember! Hand made pita, best lamb sirloin I've ever had and this place knows how to cook a steak! The prawns are to die for and the value for money is outstanding! I eat here at least once every time I come to Edmonton. The rice pudding is delicious and the baclava has the right amount of syrup. Tried the tuna the other night and left me thinking what can't this guy cook!!! The lahmacun is a must try period! Yuksel the owner /head chef puts a great deal of love and passion into his food...I love this place! Lastly, the service is consistently great with the staff ready to help with any questions u have regarding the unique Turkish cuisine.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"From time to time Edmonton manages to surprise me with a hidden gem. For sure Sofra is one of those restaurants. We were a group of 8 and we had our own dining table in a private room which was a fantastic arrangement for a large group. The restaurant has a warm ambiance and it almost feels like dining at home. Everything on the menu from desert to bread is cooked by the chef. 

We started the meal by stuffed apricots and a trio of dips and fresh baked pita bread. All of them were perfect and taste of spicy date dip and stuffed apricot was truly unique. The bread was also excellent. As the main dish my wife and I shared the rack of lamb and lamb loin dishes. Both cooked to perfection. The lamb was excellent and the spices and herbs that was used to cook the lamb made it taste authentic. 

We finished the meal with Turkish coffee and house made Baklava. For sure a grand finale. Do not miss the Baklava. 

The restaurant is on the pricey side but it totally worth it. I will defiantly go back there.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Love love love LOVE this place! From walking into 
The beautiful interior and having the most amazing food in this city.. THe chef is remarkable!!! 
The service could be more friendly/welcoming and more customer service orientated.  It could be that they are super busy. 
I had placed an order for the sun dried pizza, kabab, chicken, and lastly the mouth watering baklava. Everything was perfect and I cannot wait to go back again. Just wish it wasn't as pricey !!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Amazing baklava!!!!! I loved the food it was delicious. They don't allow kids under 11 which makes it hard for me to go there as often, but other then that I loved it",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Somewhere around downtown on the end of 106st, you'll pass the bold black sign with the words ""Sofra Authentic Turkish Cuisine"", which is actually less striking than you'd imagine. 

Lost between beige buildings in between some not so bustling impark parking lots, it's something you can easily miss, but once you're inside, boy are you in for a treat.  

Once you walk in through the entrance the warm orange painted walls wrap you up into the cozy space. Pendant lights from the ceiling unconsciously draws our eyes up as it brings to view the quirky wooden window grills peaking into their 2nd level dining space. The main area, being their main dining spot is tight but strategically spaced out for enough wiggle room for tables and diners to move around freely. Right in the middle is the spiral staircase leading to the basement where you'll find the third dining area! With a more intimate feel, the more prominent detail of this part is the Turkish seating area, which is where we opted to be. 

The biggest difference between Sofra and other Turkish eateries I've been to is probably the price between dishes. This is definitely one of the pricier places i've been to for Turkish food, portion sizes were big, but overall not really anything over the top in my opinion to justify the price. I'm guessing with the layout and atmosphere, they're aiming for more of classy date night spot, which explains the ballooned prices.

Biber Ezme - ($12) - A red pepper yogurt dip that came with fresh pita, the dip was delicious, just well done flavors of tangy creamy yogurt. The pita bread was dressed with some olive oil and sesame seeds. Not a fan of the bread here at all TBH , I think the sesame seeds took away a lot of the flavors from the dip rather than adding to it. Even more ridiculous that you have to pay $5 for extra bread. 

Adana Kebab - ($23) - Their signature spicy ground beef kebab, this was also pretty good, kebab was juicy and pact a lot of flavor, not really spicy though.

Tavuk Sis Kebab - ($28) - Chicken Skewers ""charred to perfection"", charred to perfection, sure, chicken was still moist. Wasn't as flavorful as I'd want it to be though. 

All entrees came with grilled vegetables, a salad with their house dressing, and a portion of bulgur pilaf. The salad dressing was my highlight, would come just to order a salad just because the dressing is THAT good. The bulgur pilaf was tomato based which actually made it super heavy and I wasn't a fan of it. 

Overall, as we sat cross-legged on some comfy cushions and pillows, we enjoyed our dining experience. It was fun and something new, but this wouldn't be my first recommendation for Turkish food. Nor will it be at the top of my list to revisit again.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"The reviews for Sofra don't lie! When you walk in, the decor is welcoming and themed very tastefully, even equipped with a large trojan horse. Perhaps its casual fine dining. Its classy but not stuffy. 

There are two menus - meze/tapas downstairs and fine dining upstairs. The waitress was super friendly and let us review both menus before we decided where to sit. We opted for the dining room although I encourage anyone to try the meze's because their appetizers are amazing!  

The chef prepared, seasoned, and grilled all our food to perfection.  Everything is so fresh. I have never been to Turkey so I can't speak for authenticity, but they chefs here take their food seriously!  It's like, Food Network worthy!

So far, I've been so lucky to have tried the stuffed apricots, stuffed grape leaves, the meat platter, the veggie plate, hummus and baklava.  Everything was shockingly delicious.  The baklava is homemade and fresh.  I don't even like baklava but this baklava is amazing!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Do try the swordfish and the grape leaf rolls. The cute little 'evil eye' carved into the middle of the table adds an interesting touch to the experience.,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Excellent food, attentive service, big portions.  A MUST TRY RESTAURANT IN EDMONTON!!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Reviewed this place 3-5 years ago and the quality is exactly the same as it was then. Loved it then, love it now! Can't recommend the hummus and pita chips as well as the Bonfile enough!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
Friendly cozy atmosphere. Loved watching the chef/owner doing his craft from the glass panel to the kitchen. We tried a bit of everything and were not disappointed. A must!,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"The down stairs was intimate and clean and friendly. The lamb was exquisite  salad was awesome and the cheese platter was amazing these folks deserve to be busy. 

Get there as soon as possible you will love it!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I was over at Grant Mac doing some work at the library when suppertime was approaching and I started to get hungry. I love Turkish food, well what I've had of Turkish food, so I though Sofra would be a good choice. The restaurant was quite busy when I got there, and it probably would have been best to call ahead for a reservation, but I was able to get a seat at the bar. It was pretty cold outside when I went so I got the lamb casserole, which was sort of like a shepherd's pie with lamb and topped with cheese. It doesn't look like much, at first, but the dish has lot's of vegetables and lamb and was very filling. So much so that I didn't have any room for baklava (which I love). The only thing I didn't like was that there were bones in with the lamb - the pieces were pretty small and so I wasn't really expecting bone. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it would have been nice to be warned. Aside from that the waitress was nice, and the food was really good. It's a little pricey, but not unreasonably so, and considering how delicious the food was I'd say it was worth it. I do wish that Sofra was open during lunch - it would be nice to go there during lunch breaks at school, but coming here for dinner was a nice treat.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I didn't think Sofra would have nice decor but it surprised me.

The food was tasty and enjoyable, not much more you can ask for I guess. The service was good but the the food took a little bit longer than it should have I thought. Their kabobs are very good!

It's a great place to check out when you are looking for something new.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"If you're craving Turkish cuisine which includes delicious grilled meats/ veggies/seafood and pita with various dips, then look no further. Sofra is probably the best choice in the city for well-prepared food. I highly recommend the pita with hummus, the grape-leave appetizers and the garlic shrimp as appetizers. You can't go wrong with any of the entree selections - there's something for everyone. I've also tried one of their Turkish pizzas, although prepared well - I found a hair in it so needless to say returned the dish but they made me a new one and by that point I was a bit turned off by eating it so it was just okay to me. The interior decor is kitschy but cozy. They are usually quite busy so be prepared to make reso's or try arriving early or later in the evening.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
I'm sitting here now in the wine cellar portion. It's beautiful. My server is lovely. I've been here for almost 2 hours with a group of 5. I am so hungry. We've had mezze coming out slowly. It's delicious but all I can think of - when can I leave so I can order food somewhere that will come out in real time?,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Ah sofra...I never knew you were there...I cannot believe sofra has been in its location for 11 years and I go to the hairdresser up the street. Apparently I live under a rock. 
Anyway, finally tried it.  Mmm mm, delightful. Right up my taste alley. I love the whole chick pea, lamb, beef, bread, Mediterranean, wine experience. Also the desert colours on the walls, the anti evil eye symbol right in the table, and Comfortable chairs, all so relaxing. My fussy friend had the salmon, loved it. My lamb aficionado friend had the rack of lamb, loved it. I had the koftes which I am sometimes reluctant to order because I don't like any pink, they were perfect.  
We are going back soon to try other things....",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Found this place through Yelp. 
Absolutely fantastic choice! So glad I decided to try it based on the reviews.  

The place is definitely busy so if you're with a group be sure to call ahead and reserve a spot. I was travelling solo for business and was lucky to get the last seat at the bar. The service here is fantastic! Everyone was very friendly and helpful for choosing something off the menu - I always like to ask the servers what their favorite dishes are when I go somewhere new. Even the other patrons of the restaurant are really friendly.

I ended up going with the spicy beef kabob - I believe it was called 'Adana Kabob' but I could be wrong. It was a signature dish. Anyway, it was amazing. So delicious. Yes, spicy but not too bad. It came with grilled veggies and salad - I opted out of the bulgar wheat. You can tell everything on the plate was made fresh and in-house. Seriously fantastic. I also tried Turkish coffee for the first time - I don't know where this has been all my life!!! 

I will definitely be going back any time I'm in Edmonton. Don't miss out! Check this place out, you won't be disappointed.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Some of the tastiest food you will ever eat. Similar to Greek fare, all dishes are unbelievably flavorful. Go as a group and order a bunch of appetizers to share. Just be sure you make a reservation. There's never an empty table.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I was visiting Edmonton from Miami and a friend suggested we go to Sofra. Best decision ever! Our waiter, Winston was amazing. He went above and beyond for us. The food was amazing. The meat was tender. The baklava was a bit too soggy for my taste but over all great food. He also made great recommendations as to where we should go for dancing.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Top notch hummus, lamb and swordfish. The steaks bomb diggity too",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"October 2018 - Sad experience, I guess they've decided to mail it in.

I remembered going to Sofra years ago and was very happy with the meal...my how things have changed!

Ordered 2 appetizers (to start) which were served over 30 min apart. We decided to not go for any mains due to the sad quality and no heads up on the delay with the first two dishes:

Our first dish was 8-10 reconstituted dried apricots that were stuffed with something resembling Philadelphia cream cheese served over top of what appeared to be oily garlicly frozen spinach.

After over a half hour wait, out came the Turkish appetizer platter which included (separately) mushrooms, pastrami, and some grape leaves rolled and stuffed with same sad cheese...come on you guys! The doozie included a personal size pizza flatbread sliced in 4 pieces and cost us $27 - which I would say was rather offensive overall for such a small, salty, oily, dish.

Anyways, I wish I could say the crew of at least 4 kitchen staff were ""overwhelmed"" but the friday dinner rush had long passed (later in the evening) and the restaurant had a number of empty tables. Pathetic.

I hope Sofra really steps things up because after my last experience I'd rather get my Mediterranean fix from the ready-to-eat counter at Save on Foods.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Never eat at Sofra on Friday the 13th! (and certainly don't send anything back to the chef!)

Normally a devout and 3-4X a year Sofra fan, I've always ordered the Sultan's Sofrasi, as mentioned in other reviews: a 4 course platter of appetizers, main course of meats and the almighty baklava finish. When eating the lamb portion of our dinner, the lamb was raw of both pieces of meat. Normally, I enjoy a medium or well done cutlet (and the chef/owner ALWAYS cooks it in this fashion without special request to the amazing and professional wait staff). Considering the potential for bacteria and food poison, my bff and I request that the meat be cooked thoroughly. It's returned in only slightly better condition. This game of ping pong is done 3 more times over 2 different selections of lamb (the owner refuses to swap out for other kind of meat such as hamburger patties, chicken or beef that is also served with the dish), before I'm vehemently told that ""this is the way that it is always prepared"" and that ""You're stupid for not telling the wait staff how you want it done"". Upon consultation with our two servers, this is apparently typical behaviour for the owner whenever food is deemed unsafe or undesirable by patrons. The owner smugly repeats his aforementionned comments when I pay for my meal with one of our servers for the evening. After 4 years of dining at Sofra, I think it's time to find a new Turkish place.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I love this place and I used to be a regular except that they do not take children under 12 (tip!). I finally starting coming by again, and I must say it is a great place with amazing meats and the bread is a fresh as it gets. I normally order the Sultan Platter (2 people but you can maybe feed 3). It comes with a variety of meats, salad, humus and bulgur. Baklava is also included. 

I am not gonna lie to you. It is pricy! And their current list of wines is even more so! I also wish they had better dessert selections. But overall this is among the best Turkish restaurants I have visited across Canada.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
Sofra Restaurant is a nice place with great service and food!  The owner told us that he goes grocery shopping every morning to get the fresh ingredients for his dishes!  I have been to this restaurant a few times and the food is always tasty and yummy!,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
The best Turkish restaurant in North America to my opinion! Used to ho to Sofra when I lived in Edmonton long time ago. ChecKed out the place after almost 10 years and the food is still good.,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Delicious food! The hummus with pita is fantastic, we had the rack of lamb and the chicken skewers and both were cooked fantastically. If anything would like for the restaurant to have an online reservation system but would 100% recommend you check it out.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Went here for the first time this weekend and the food downstairs was delicious. They serve only appetizers style dishes downstairs in the cellar, and I think there is more of a dinner style menu upstairs. The atmosphere was just right for a quieter night out with good friends. We will have to try the dinner menu next time.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Sofra is another restaurant that has been on my hit list for quick some time now. It looks quite unassuming from the outside but once you step inside, you are greeted to an inviting, cozy and warm Turkish restaurant. Yes, you read right, this place specializes in Turkish food. Not something you see much of in this town.

We dropped by on an early Saturday evening, a spur of a moment kind of decision. With no reservations (I'd recommend it if you want a prime time slot), the staff informed us we could have a table as long as we were out of there by 7:45pm. That gave us more than enough time (over 2 hours) for our meal so we took it.

Sultan's sofrasi ($80.00) - this is Sofra's meal for two to share: two appetizers (yaprak sarma and humus), a mixed grilled meat sampler (chicken kebab, swordfish, beef meatballs and rack of lamb) and baklava for dessert. The best way to sample what Sofra has to offer.

- Yaprak sarma - grape-vine leaves stuffed with rice, raisins and pine nuts. These were a great way to start off our meal. Similar to Greek dolmas, the yaprak sarma were light, flavourful and had an umami balance of sweet and sour flavours.
- Humus -the humus came with a generous amount of fresh baked pita. The pita was lightly brushed with oil and nicely seasoned with sesame seeds. Man, if I could make pita like this at home, I'd be one happy camper. The humus was fresh but taste wise, it was pretty standard. It could have used something else (squeeze of lemon or garlic perhaps?).
- Grilled meat sampler - the grilled meat platter came with two pieces each of chicken kebab, swordfish, beef meatballs and rack of lamb. It also came with a couple pieces of grilled vegetables (zuchinni, tomatoes and green pepper). It would have been nice to have more veggies.

The other dish consisted of bulgur pilaf and a mixed green salad. I don't eat much bulgur pilaf but this was perfect with all of the meats we had. The swordfish and lamb were delicccious (the lamb was perfectly cooked medium rare). The chicken was moist and flavourful. The salad was standard, basic greens.
- Baklava - everyone loves baklava and these ones were made just right, stuffed with walnuts, pistachio and drizzled with honey syrup. Not too sweet, these were the perfect way to end our meal. Stuffed and happy.

I'm glad I was finally able to try out Sofra's. While it's not the cheapest place, you pay for quality. It definitely is a great place to celebrate a special occasion with friends, family or that special someone. They recently renovated their bottom floor, aptly named The Cellar at Sofra, which is spacious and looks great. They even have a separate menu, which you can find on their Facebook page (see link below) by clicking on ""Menu"". Next time I will have to try that out or their pideler (traditional baked pizzas)! Look for the ""evil eye"" carved into the tables for added amusement.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I went to Sofra on a spur of the moment ""how about"" with my companion on the 25 of January :-) We hadn't been here in YEARS (yes, double digit years almost!).  I am glad we returned as the quality hasn't changed and the friendliness of the Staff hasn't either :-) 

We ordered the Biber Ezme and a Piyaz Salad (we should have stopped there....the portions are very generous so I recommend you share these in 4 if you have an average appetite) before our entrees.  They were both delicious and flavourful.  My entree was the Adana Kabab which was delicious and filling on a chilly night.  My companion ordered the Ahi Tuna which was VERY good and next time will order myself! For dessert, we ordered the Baklava and I had the Sutlu Irmik which was a new taste for me and I really enjoyed it.  The flavour isn't sugary sweet and there are delicate flavours of nougat and rose :-)

A nice and easy spot to have a really nice and easy dinner :-) 

Looking forward to returning SOON :-)",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Great service. Delicious food. The stuffed grape leaves were at tad pricey at $12 for 4 but they were good. I had the Adana kebab ($23) - spicy Turkish meat skewer (sooooo good and flavourful) served with a bulgur pilaf and a delicious honey vinaigrette salad. Absolutely delicious meal I could have every week. 

It's near the new Rogers Place if you're there for an event.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I went to sofra with some girls from work on a Friday evening. We've all been wanting to come for a while so this was much anticipated. For parking, it is free after 6 pm for side street parking (as per the meter). The restaurant is located pretty closely to grant mcewan.

The restaurant has a very warm ambience. We had a nice reserved spot in the back with a clear view of the kitchen. Overall service was good and our server gave us her recommendations which we appreciated.

The dips are a must have item. We were all blown away by the hummus dip. Very flavorful with a little kick to it. The feta dip and red pepper dip was nice and creamy with a tangy flavour as well and paired very well with their seasoned pita bread. We also shared the orduevi (we ordered 2 because there were 8 of us altogether). The jumbo shrimp and the beef flatbread were my favourite but everything was very tasty. I found everything spiced to perfection! Next i had the lamb loin which was delectable! I'm a lamb lover so he warned if you're not a fan of that mildly gamey taste (i personally love it). The lamb was cooked to perfection and very flavorful and not at all dry. I devoured the entire thing! It was also accompanied by the tiger prawns (again I highly recommend this) and salad and rice and with some delicious cheese to pair with my meat. 

We loved sofra and cannot wait to come back!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"This has to be my all time favorite Turkish restaurant in Edmonton. The chicken was perfectly marinated and cooked to perfection. I even tried the lamb thanks to my friend A. Oh yes, its New Zealand lamb. I've never enjoyed New Zealand lamb because of the gamey taste. But Sofra got it right. Service was wonderful and it wasnt too busy but it could be that we went on a Sunday. I think Friday and Saturday could be their busier times. Children under 12 are not allowed. Im not sure when or if this rule has always applied but its good to be aware. Washrooms were clean. If you are looking for authentic turkish cuisine this is the place.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I really like Sofra. My last visit there was exceptional. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary. We ordered the Sultan's four-course meal for two. It was incredible and a great way to sample the menu if you're not familiar with Turkish fare. It started with stuffed grape leaves, a duo of dips with Sofra's delicious handmade pita bread, then a platter of meats, bulgar and fresh greens. The dessert is perhaps the most amazing Baklava I've tried, and it was the perfect finish to the meal. 

The chef and owner of Sofra is Turkish and went back to his homeland to be trained as a chef. The food is always perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. If you go, be sure to try their pita and dips, washed down with a Turkish beer. Incredible.

I've always had great service, and the restaurant is unique and cozy. I highly recommend Sofra.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I'm pregnant and about to pop, so we've been eating out a lot and have recently had quite a lot of bad experiences.  I had heard great things about Sofra in the past but have always forgotten about it. Tonight we were searching for a place close to home, and not too heavy and when this popped up on Urban Spoon, we decided to give it a try.  My dinner companion is by far the pickiest so I was waiting for him to unleash his initial thoughts of disappointment when we walked in, but surprisingly all was good. 

1. parking, no problem, we got parking right out front
2. It was clean, and there wasn't heavy food smells in the air considering they had a grill which can sometimes get a bit smokey and then you smell like your dinner after you leave for hours afterward
3. Got greeted and seated right away by friendly staff
4. The menu, not too big or confusing.  We decided on the Sultans Sofranis for two
5. Food came out in a timely manner
6. Waitress was friendly and genuine. 

The food:

First course: Grape Leaves - delicious, can't really go wrong here.

Second: Pita and hummus.  It was different that what I've had before, the pita were thinner and lighter and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, the hummus was perfectly balanced and had a bit of kick and great consistency to go with the lighter pitas.

Main: The main feast: lambchops, meatballs, swordfish, and chicken kababs, all cooked perfectly, not overdone and moist with the perfect amount of char, great flavour.  Also came with the bulgar wheat and salad - also both very good.

dessert: We opted not to get the baklava (i know, i know) and got strawberry ice cream instead.  Even the strawberry ice cream was a nice surprise, rich, creamy and with real chunks of strawberries! I'm sure it was just out of a box, but I wondered if it was made in house.

Overall, it was a simply a great experience amongst a slew of recent disappointments, so we were both just so pleased to have checked it out and will be back again!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
Since this was my first experience with Turkish food I don't have anything to compare it to. The lentil soup was fantastic. The freshly made baklava was amazing. I had a spiced beef kabob which I can't remember the name of which again was really good. They also have a kind of pizza/ meat pie pastry?. That was excellent as well and very filling. Parking out front is limited and the name on the front of the business is hard to see while driving by. They open at 5pm so they don't have lunch service. Worth going back to.,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Absolutely refreshing after some poor experiences in Edmonton. A quaint comfortable room with informed professional wait staff that works together. The main attraction, the chef and his wonderful cuisine. Beautifully prepared Lamb loin with tender succulent prawns, seasoned Bulgar and expertly roast vegetables with a tasty cacik (I believe). The greens and spinach were of the freshest I've had in a while, expertly prepared and marvellously dressed. the handmade in shop baclava should be sampled and I would recommend the turkish coffee (no cream).
A truly remarkable repast.
Thank-you",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Exceptional Every Time! Pitas fresh out of the oven served with dips prepared daily by the owner who is also the chef, is an amazing way to start any meal. Whether it's the famed Sultan's platter, the chicken kebabs, or the rack of lamb, everything is always cooked to succulent perfection! although every meat selection is always marinated and cooked to perfection, my absolute favourite is the egg, spinach, and cheese pizza. Unlike any other pizza I've ever had and always leaves me wishing there was just one more piece.

The cozy Turkish atmosphere is always welcoming. The staff is always friendly as the tend fully to every table. And if you're there later in the evening, as the dinner rush slows, you can get a chance to visit with owner as he stops  by your table to ensure everything was perfect.

Is one of my favourite places to take new people. I love to share this hidden gem.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Yuksil is a craftsman of Turkish cuisine!  His staff is always delightful and very helpful with Menu selections. You can enjoy the new wine bar and the special menu in the wine cellar .  

Make sure you take time to watch your meal being prepared by the master chef!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"The Sofra Sofrasi was amazing! It's a great sharing size for 2-3 people and everything was super delicious but I loved the grape leaves and the lamb! 

The staff were absolutely fantastic! The amazing chef came up to greet our party in the private seating area and even took us on a mini tour of the cellar in the basement! 

My friends and I had such a great time last night and cannot say enough good stuff about this place! I highly recommend it and will definitely be back soon!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"This is my favourite restaurant in Edmonton. I have been coming here since it first opened. Everything is delicious. Things you must try: Any of the dips with the bread, sea bass, and the Adana kabab.  I was just here for Edmonton Dining week so they had a special menu which was delicious.  I had the 
Helim Peyniri - Grilled eggplant wrapped halloumi cheese
Izgara Somon - Grilled Chinook salmon topped with an orange saffron butter
Sutlu Irmik - Dense semolina cake with coconut, pistachio, & orange peel. Topped with whip cream and pomegranate sauce
My friend had the 
Tutsulu Ordek Carpaccio: Smoked duck carpaccio finished with a cayenne butter
Kusleme - Marinated lamb medallions stuffed with fresh herbs and blue cheese and
Baklava - Layers of pastry filled with walnut, pistachio, and honey
Everything was delicious. What stood out was the beautiful dish of eggplant and halloumi cheese, as well as the marinated lamb medallions. 
Generally though, when we go we get the Sultans feast which is a combination of their kababs and appetizers served with pilaf and salad. This is a great way to try an assortment of everything.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"There's this new Turkish restaurant downtown by the Healy-Ford Motors, at 104 Ave. and 106 St. It's quite large, with a cozy, cheerful feel, hardwood-floors and wonderful smells wafting from their open-air kitchen. They sell grilled meats and veggies, delicious dips with homemade pita bread and lots of syrupy sweet baklava, in case you have any room left over for dessert. The main dishes go for between $16 and $20. 

The grilled chicken kebabs are excellent and come in huge portions that two people could really share. The chicken was high-quality breast meat, not cheap, gristly bits, like I've gotten before in some Lebanese and Greek restaurants. The shrimp casserole is also very good, served with a salad and risoto with a tomato base. For appies, the pizza and garlicy yogurt dip will wet your appetite well. I heard the pizza's excellent, though haven't yet tasted it. You can expect to spent $50 here + drinks.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
Why go any where else!!  Date night and Sea Bass and beef kebab that were ordered are just layered with flavours.  Awesome job to chef Yuksal.  Keep up with the supersizes !!,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Sofra never disappoints. We go there for most,  if not all of our special occasions. The chef is super friendly, welcoming and so down to earth. Staff are always friendly and accommodating but give you some space. 
The place gets packed sometimes and it's a good idea to make a reservation. 
Highly recommend the 3 dips and fresh bread appetizers for groups ( the bread comes out coated in butter/margarine).
Personal favorite on the menu is Pasa Kebab  which is lamb and 2-3 prawns with a bit of their slightly spicy tomato sauce and a little bit of yogurt dip, served with bulgur pilaf and a salad.   Other suggestions are Adana Kebab (spicy ground beef skewer), rack of lamb and chicken pide.
We are usually too full for dessert but we have been offered a few pieces of baklava on the house on a couple of occasions and it was very good (more on the mildly sweet side).",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"We had a very nice dinner here in the upstairs private room which was very nice and quiet. We started with the three dips with pita bread which was thinner than other pita bread that I've had. All of the dips were delicious and they brought us more bread when we asked.

I had the Donar Kebab which was spicy and had an excellent flavor. For dessert, we had the fig and date parfait which was also very tasty.

Service was great.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"This was my first experience with Turkish food, and man was it tasty. I was lucky enough to be there with a large group which meant we were able to order several dishes to share. The dips were incredibly flavorful, particularly the walnut pepper dip. I'd also suggest trying the pizzas, and the chicken kabobs were awesome. Make sure you make a reservation though. I had tried to drop in without a reservation twice before and wasn't able to get a seat.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"We (4 people)are (were)regular customers. We made a reservation a month in advance... they stuck us in a corner 2 feet next to the door, which was being opened constantly. (Freezing).
When we asked to be moved, we were treated rudely and offensively. She said we should have asked not to be seated next to the door. REALLY!! 
They made no attempt to accommodate us. We left!  We went to Sabor Di Vino where they found us a table although they were full... why.... because we are regular customers!! Better food anyway! Great evening!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Great food! Nice decor/ambiance. They also have a private party room downstairs that would be really cozy for a group event like a birthday, anniversary or bachelorette party. Our waiter was very friendly and upbeat. Look forward to a return visit.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw

"Intimate atmosphere, delicious food. The freshly baked pita (clay oven!) and hummus are a must try. My favourite little gem in Edmonton",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"A must try for any of our family or friends that visit Edmonton, everyone leaves satisfied and inspired having tried something new and beyond any taste they could of imagined  of deliciousness from this cuisine! The owner always comes over and asks us if we enjoyed our meal... which is always YES! Its nice to see a owner checking in with his customers, shows a lot of passion for his work!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Lovely place for dinner. We will be back!

Started with these appies:
- hummus: must have (so delish and the pita was so light and tasty
-apricots: these were not bad but not my fav, prob cuz I'm not a fan of mixing sweet with dinner dishes
-pastrami: must have (so tasty, the mix of salty with the cheese and the figs was the perfect blend and I don't really like figs but u cuz taste them slightly
-meatballs: these were also tasty although I much preferred the pastrami dish

For our entrees we shared the sea bass and grilled chicken. Both were so tasty but my fav was the sea bass. Highly recommend!  Not a fan of the rice that comes with but the salad and grilled veggies were good",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
I recommend the hummus as an appetizer and the Pasa Kebab (Lamb and Shrimp) as the entre,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
Love this restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is always great. Be sure to make a reservation!,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I have never been disappointed at Sofra. The pita bread is delicious with a great selection  of humus for dips. I have tried all the kebabs, but my favorite would be the swordfish. If you are in a group, the Sultan ' s table gives you a little bit of everything. The lounge downstairs also provides a place to relax after dinner.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"The Turkish delicacies are delightful. The platter for two or for however many you want, is an absolute must for first timers. The hummus is the best I have ever had and can be purchased to go, along with their insanely good version of pita bread. Beautifully crisped with a little oil. You could get full on that alone. Service is always personable. The food couldn't be more consistent and absolutely of the highest standard. The only request I would have is possibly consider renovating the interior, as it is somewhat old and dated.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"This restaurant has the best everything. Best dips, best pitas, best bulgar pilaf, but hands down THE BEST LAMB CHOPS I'VE EVER TASTED!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"Great food, great service, great ambience. I moved here from a different continent and have always been particular about my food. Sofra by far gave me the best satisfaction in my tummy. I was a little skeptical when I looked at the menu (having had Turkish food in Turkey). It didn't seem all that appealing. Anyhow, I ordered the pita bread with dip (their feta dip is extremely garlicky which I love), their chicken skewers came with delicious couscous, grilled veggies and a salad. It was basic ingredients made extremely tasty. The chicken was juicy and well seasoned. My hubs had the lamb casserole and licked his bowl just to get the last bit of flavour. My friends had the swordfish and the sultan platter. All of them loved it. A little pricey but for good food and good service it's worth it. The chef is a one man show and he came over by our table to ask us how we liked the food etc. Overall I will be back and will drag all my friends here!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"The best Food you can have in Edmonton! It is always fresh, with the best quality you can imagine, The restaurat is always full even on week days, so that explains a lot! The owner/chef/ master is a very nice talented man whose focus is on the quality. I always enjoyed dining there when I was living in Edmonton, miss my regular dining in Sofra",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I Heart Sofra!

This is a true gem of a restaurant in Edmonton. If you enjoy Turkish food or are wanting to try it, this is the place to come here in the city. You have a great selection of grilled meats, seafood and vegetables to tantalize your taste buds. The variety, the flavours, the ambiance and the hospitality all contribute to my 5 star review. 

I have been here many times and have thoroughly enjoyed every experience but last night's meal and service was top notch. I was especially impressed because it is Downtown Dining Week and it can get very busy. This combined with a set menu can sometimes diminish the quality but this was not the case.

Some of my recommendations are the dolma - stuffed grape leaves with rice with a bit of cinnamon - so delicious. The stuffed apricots with goat cheese are to die for. The feta stuffed mushrooms with tomato basil sauce are great and any of the dips with pita are wonderful. I would have to say the way that the pita bread is prepared is my favourite compared to any other Mediterranean restaurant in the city. The baked pizzas are fantastic! I especially enjoy the Ispanakli Pide: spinach, egg and cheese pizza. If you are too overwhelmed by the menu, the Sultan's Sofrasi is a good choice as it gives a little sampling of a variety of things.

As for my meal last night - the pita bread and hummus were great as per usual as well as the stuffed mushrooms. But what blew my mind was the lamb tenderloin served with pilaf, lightly dressed salad and grilled vegetables. The lamb is the best I have ever had! So moist and tender - I felt like I was eating the creme de la creme white meat of steaks. The flavours were wonderful. The salad wasn't overdressed but refreshing and the veggies were grilled to perfection.

The service last night was especially great. I unfortunately forget our servers name but she was very friendly, helpful and checked in on us regularly. 

I look forward to my next visit!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"ATTENTION FAMILIES WITH KIDS OR KID-LOVING FAMILIES: We saw this restaurant featured on Food TV and we went there with our eight-year old son who was very eager to try their food. As soon as we got in, the host said that ""kids under 10 are not allowed  at the restaurant because kids have had accidents at the bar in the restaurant before."" I understand if kids are not allowed at the bar, but not allowed in the restaurant at all????

There was no indication of this policy outside their restaurant or was not mentioned on Food TV or their website.
We have travelled a lot and have never been turned down before. This is the first time ever in our years of traveling that we saw such a discriminatory policy!!!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
Delicious food. Lamb and chicken were amazing as well as great hummus. Decent wine list and good service for the group of 20.,EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"The moment you enter this place you know you're in for a treat! It's inviting aromas from the kitchen greet you right at the door. Staff are lovely and knowledgeable and give you great suggestions and explain the menu in detail. The decor is eccentric and they have beautiful Turkish lamps and textiles with wood accents that give it a really warm and authentic feel.

We started out with fresh pita, hummus, grape leaf rolls, all amazing and full of flavour!  I ordered the grilled Tiger prawns and it was served with rice and salad. The prawns were massive and the meal was excellent. I was able to steal a few bites of chicken from another plate and it was tender and juicy but packed with flavour. 

A few other people at the table ordered the sultans platter and it was massive!!!!! Enough to feed 4 people. Portion size is very good and you will leave stuffed.  I had a Turkish coffee with some sweet and flakey baclava for dessert.

This is the kinda of restaurant you could stay at for hours. It was very busy but the kinda of hustle and bustle that makes you feel comfortable, you can hear laughter and good vibes from other people enjoying it to!

I can't wait to come back for another meal!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"This was a whole new experiment for me.  I don't often eat out, but I thought I should turn over a new leaf by checking out a new place.

The staff were very welcoming.  I went with a good friend, and we both felt like we were important people the way staff attended to us.  Not to pushy, but always there when we had a question about the menu or wanted more water.  Our main server was very engaging and really added to the experience.

The decor was fun.  I felt like I was having a Turkish experience.  I haven't been to Turkey so I don't know if this was more a 'Western version"" or reality, but it was still very cool.

We tried a bunch of different dishes.  The grilled meats were very good.  Chick peas, lamb, rice with different flavours, so many different options.  I am looking forward to coming back to trying out a few different dishes.

As a bonus the prices were reasonable.  All in all a good experience!",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw
"I ate here a couple years ago and the food was quite good and the service standard.  
Last year we tried to go here with a friend and her children.  There was no one in the restaurant and when we arrived the lady said they were fully booked and that they could not fit us in.  She was quite abrupt and not very friendly.   We were surprised since it was empty aside from maybe one or two customers.  So we called when we got to our car to see if we could come in then and the lady on the phone said it was no problem because they weren't busy.  Yet we had just been turned away a couple minutes ago.  So obviously they are not kid friendly at this restaurant.  I would not return here simply for this reason.  The food may be ok but the service and staff are not.",EyoGUM01HS9kemQcnTRLIw

"Overall - 3.5/5.0

Nice little Vietnamese shop in the heart of Edmonton. This review is purely based on the bahn mi that I had for lunch. 

Ingredients were fresh and had quite a bit of p√¢t√©. Vegetable and meat ratio married well with a nice crunch. Bread was crispy on the outside and overall the portion size is quite big. 

Price is more expensive than other places but seemed reasonable given that there are not many options around and still in line with other sandwich shops like Quiznos and Subway which were also nearby.",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"Stayed in Edmonton for a few days; ate at this restaurant 3 times; we got the same happy-face results all three times.  We ordered the cold cut sandwich (the meat inside was standard but the bread was so crunchy and toasty; the filling was of the generous-side portion), the spicy beef soup (which had the best flavor that I have never had), the rice vermicelli bowls was tasty (i particularly like the fresh veggies in it; the egg-roll side order was a good compliment to go with this dish).  We didn't try their bubble tea; we had the soda and the vietnamese coffee.  It appeared to be clean and organized during our visit; the decoration was young and urban-fitting; the ambiance was good for a sit down meal; the staff was friendly; our wait time for the food was OK,  I have no comment of the menu prices because I did not eat at others vendors around to be able to compare; however, I thought they are fairly priced for the food I ordered.  If I am ever in Edmonton area again, I will eat there.",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"V Sandwiches is a nice, reasonably priced lunch spot with a good selection of Vietnamese subs, soups and snacks.

They have three veggie sub options- a satay tofu, a lemongrass tofu, and a veggies and cheese. I've had them all and all of them are perfectly tasty. Compared with other places around the city with wider veggie options such as fake veggie meats, I would like to see more selection but the items they do have are still pretty solid.

The freshly toasted baguette is a staple of Vietnamese subs and the ones here capably house a generous portions of fillings and veggies.

The service here is always friendly but can slow down during the lunch rush for sure. Try to beat the noon crowd if you can!

Overall, V has some great subs, friendly service, and reasonable prices but it doesn't quite top my list for best veggie Vietnamese subs in the city.",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"What can I say, this is certainly my favourite stop for Vietnamese subs in downtown Edmonton. I've stopped by twice since they reopened in this location and I've thoroughly enjoyed the chicken sate subs that I've eaten. This location is pretty unassuming, but I'm happy that they have their expansive menu. I'm not terribly fond of their bubble tea (but that's not the focus of this place anyway) instead, it's their subs that I adore and will continue to eat every so often.",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"A great family owned business that delivers on customer service, and most importantly, great food. I regularly come to have their rice vermicelli bowls. While it gets extremely busy during the lunch rush, I find myself coming back for more!",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"My coworkers dragged me here for lunch. It's a smaller place but cheerfully decorated. I had the cold cut and my sandwich was tasty and filling.  My other friends has miscellaneous other banh mi- lemongrass chicken, satay beef, chicken etc. Their comments were the other sandwiches were a little bit skimpy on the meats.  We got there after lunch hour so there was no lineup. Service is efficient although we were a big group so it did take awhile for our sandwiches.  I would certainly return if l was working in the area.",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"I'm disappointed.  Was a loyal customer prior to their return and since have been back 3 times.  I find their meat portions seem smaller and they really need to cut up their meat/veggies into smaller pieces.  There is nothing worse than taking a bite and pulling out a massive piece of meat (as was my first experience) or today I pulled out a 5"" piece of cilantro.  Bread also did not seem as fresh today as previous experiences.

It may be a one off poor experience, but I'm guessing they are feeling the pain of higher rent that comes with more space and need to make up for it with the issues I described above (less meat, stretching life of bread, etc).

Wish them all the best and did have a great track record, hence the 3 stars hoping they can get going in the right direction.",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"Last Tuesday, we were walking by the place and since I really like Vietnamese food, we decided to give it a shot.
The place was empty when we went there which should have been a flag since it was around 6 PM.
We ordered our food and to my surprise it took more than 25 minutes to get our food (empty restaurant!)
I wasn't upset yet and started taking pictures of the food and was actually still excited about the food till I had the first bite! The food was room temperature and I could not understand how after 25 minutes waiting we still received a food which was not even warm enough!
Then in the middle of eating I found a piece of metal in the food. It seemed like it was a piece from a stainless steel scouring pad!
I'm not sure how dangerous it could be if had eaten it but fortunately I saw it!
I went to the counter and told the lady about it and showed the piece and she only thanked me for bringing it to her attention!!!
Overall the only positive thing I found at the place was clean environment which is not very surprising for an empty restaurant.
Customer service, the quality of the food and the value was not acceptable and very poor.
I don't recommend this place or I wouldn't go back there again!",GpFRwCHN0RI8yFbcfXjfUg
"Not a. It fan of pizza 73, but their wings are always good, until well yesterday 
I also tried their poutine and yucky gravy is not enough thick and gross, and cheese well not enough considering they are using wedges and our wings were disappointing they weren't tossed in sauce just sprayed with a sauce bottle not the way wings are ment to be, as well as the size was a disappointment pizza 73 usually have really great wings now I'm not so sure...",Im5XYJ8jP3s85Lna48HcWA
"My family and I order from here quite abit and usually it's good but the last two times, last weekend and today it's been lower quality and It's just not what I'm asking for. Double pepperoni means just that it's pretty easy to follow and understand I would think, one to two pepperoni per slice after asking for double is insulting to say the least. I'm strongly considering not using this location anymore due their lack of satisfying their customer and worrying about a few extra pepperoni shutting the business down. Listen to your customers and aim to please or get out of the business altogether. This would be the third time now this exact thing has happened.",Im5XYJ8jP3s85Lna48HcWA
"My family and I always order double pepperoni and extra sauce for one pizza and donair for the other, most often we get the pizza from this location but when we do there's  close to one pepperoni per slice the donair pizza looked like it had two pieces of meat on the entire thing. 
It's almost like the person responsible for doing this thinks if they add the toppings the customer asks and pays for that it will be a bad thing, perhaps they think each additional topping will be deducted from their pay??? I don't know why they constantly do that but I would like to start receiving the pizza we ask for and not what some cheap half wit pizza maker thinks is what I want. Definitely do not recommend this location until they learn to listen and act.",Im5XYJ8jP3s85Lna48HcWA
I order delivery from this location now less and less     When I have ordered the last few times I have not received my gift cards or movie passes.

"I was going to give this location 1 star but the customer service guy (Sam) afterwards deserves a star all his own.  I'm sitting at PapaJohns awaiting my order while I write.   I actually read these other reviews prior to calling Pizza73 and I said to myself, ""this is just a delivery issue.  I'm sure they are really great!""

They really are friendly, but they had no idea who I was.  I placed an order 2 hours in advance and gave them a specific pickup time.  I was 10 minutes late when I came to the location and they took my name and came back with the wrong order.  I said, ""no I didn't order two medium pizzas. I ordered pizzas, potatoes, wings, etc.""  I gave her my name again and they looked but had no clue who I was.  I asked if they were sure and they said, ""yes.""  So I left!   

Called customer service while I drove, because I was late to my destination, and Sam looked into the order, double checked the correct location and called them to check.  They said, ""yes!  We have his pizza!""   I thanked Sam and informed him that I had left.  He apologized and canceled the order from me. And then attached a curly fries to my next order in the future.",Im5XYJ8jP3s85Lna48HcWA
"I ordered the medium Mega meal from this location on January 29th, 2021, I got a ham and pineapple pizza and a chicken and roasted tomato pizza with the golden crispy wings. I receive my order from the delivery guy, go to eat it and it's NASTY. Pizza is rubbery and chewy and had barely any sauce, wings are spicy and they look like they've been sitting under a heat lamp for days, old and nasty. I call customer service and they offer to send a replacement. I get the replacement and once again it's NASTY and it's the same exact issue. I will NO LONGER be ordering from this pizza 73 again!

Horrible is an understatement. Called for delivery and told them I'm paying with debit. After waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes the guy is here with no debit machine. He said he will be back so I waited in the lobby for 15 minutes and he didn't show up so I went back upstairs to my apartment. I open my order and realize it's Hawaiian pizza and I don't eat pork.

"Like many people, we like to go to places that are a little more unique than chains, but aren't crazy expensive.

Belgravia hub is a cute little restaurant. good atmosphere ,although I do agree with another reviewer who said they could use some art on the walls. Nevertheless, its got a good vibe.

The server was a bit slow, but she did say she was new so I can forgive that and wouldn't say it make or broke our time.

The food (and the important part) was good. I had the braised beef which was pretty good, my boyfriend had the basa and that was also fairly tasty. We had the flatbread appetizer, which to me was nothing special. 

Overall I would say its good, but wont be a favorite. I would go there again for sure though. I do like that the menu is reasonably priced, and isn't shocking amounts like other more local restaurants. I would say give it a try if your looking for somewhere new :)",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
My family and I have gone twice and all three of us have loved our meals both times we went. It's a small place and intimate atmosphere with friendly staff and good food! Make sure to book a reservation just in case to be able to get in since it is a small place.,Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"This restaurant is an incredible neighbourhood jewel.

The food was great, the service was decent, especially because they were missing a server (about 25% of the staff, by the looks of things).

My only real complaint was the noise level.  While the restaurant can't really choose their patrons (the six women in the corner sounded like about 15), they could have some acoustical treatments applied to the ceiling, etc., to dampen the noise.

We've returned for a second visit at lunch (at about 1:45), and we were the only ones in there.  Despite that, the food was still fresh, excellent and the server friendly and prompt!

Totally recommend this place, especially if you're in the neighbourhood.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"I came here for lunch with some co-workers. This is one of those places where I really wish I could review the food and service separately (I mean give them separate star ratings). In lieu of that, I've gone with a 3 star rating for their 4-5 star food and their 1-2 star service...

My table got a couple appetizers to share - the artichoke crab dip and the corn fritters. I didn't try the dip but I did have half a fritter. While my entire table loved both of things things, I found the fritter to be too deep fried tasting... and not in a delicious donut-ey way... more in a stale oil hasn't been changed in way too long kind of way.

But my sandwich... oh my goodness my sandwich. I got the Pesto Chicken Flatbread sandwich with soup, and I really didn't have high expectations. Even when it came, it didn't look THAT great (picture). But it was delicious. The flatbread was so soft and chewy it was actually one of my new favourite sandwich breads. And the chicken/prosciutto/pesto were all flavourful and complimented each other perfectly. I got the cauliflower/potato soup (of the day) and it was an insanely generous portion for a side dish... and it was very nice and creamy and almost tasted cheese if anything. Anyways, it was very good.

But the service... First off, there wasn't much of it. There were maybe 5 tables (so it was pretty full) but there only seemed to be one server. I had to ask the cook to bring me more water when she came with the food because our server was nowhere to be found with a jug. When our server did come the once, and when she came to bring items, she kept leaning over me and almost touching my glass, which I found kind of unsanitary. She also grabbed my shoulder on a couple occasions. When bringing the bill and saying 'thank you, bye', she grabbed it and squeezed a little - I was SO uncomfortable. She didn't even apologize when I kind of jerked away from her hand. She also only brought us one bill for a group of 6. At this point (we waited for the bill for probably 10 minutes), we just gave up and one girl paid and we agreed to pay her back. But seriously, you think that 6 people want a single bill? Ugh, overall, I kind of hated the service. If it wasn't for that perfect sandwich, I'd never go back. But that sandwich was good enough that I probably will.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
A smart eatery with a couple rough edges. Menu is well Balanced and tasty with great flavours. Geared more to an adult evening. Wine selection is good. Location and vibe is good,Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"My wife and I were challenged to find a decent place for dinner tonight.  The normal spots weren't working for us...too predictable and routine/mainstream.

We thought of this location that we had passed a couple of times when driving in the general area of the U of A.  

Welllll....nice hole in the wall location. Staff is excellent, decent decor.  We had the Chardonnay, my wife ordered the Ginger Soy Salmon.  I ordered the chicken/back bacon burger with the hoity/toity salad.  It was delicious.  My wife moved me and she let me try her salmon.  Also delicious!  And served with roasted veggies.

We would come back here in a heart beat.

My only complaint...they need art on the walls...maybe a big picture of me....!

Truly recommended.  Enjoy!",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Great Value at this cozy little neighbourhood restaurant. The food and the decor seem like you're eating at an expensive new age restaurant, but the price doesn't match the experience. Everything is made in house with lots of flavour. Perfect place to go for a quiet little night.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"If you appreciate and value the expensive mediocrity of the prevailing chain/sports bar restaurants in Edmonton then you will not like this neighbourhood jewel.  However if a fabulous meal at a reasonable price in a friendly neighbourhood environment is your preference, this is the place.  Is it trendy? NO, thank goodness. Is it pretentious and/or stuffy? Same answer. Is it a great place to dine with a friend, loved one, or on your own at the bar? Absolutely yes!  We have been there several times and it has become our favourite place for dinner. The atmosphere is different every visit, depending on the other diners; sometimes quiet and cozy while other times a little boisterous. Regardless of the group in-house at the time it is always a great experience.  Enjoy!!",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Belgravia Hub is such a delightful lil Edmonton eatery! I've been a couple of times and both were fantastic! 
Last time I was there I had the Miso glazed salmon and it was so delish! 
The ambience is nice, it's definitely got a wine bar vibe. With that said, it's got a great wine list and local brews on tap! 
Last time we went we took a walk around the neighbourhood after our meal! Such a great locale! So many unique houses. All in all great experience!",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Only 3 stars for us.  Our impression was that the chef didn't taste the food before serving.  The braised beef was very dry and so chewy it was virtually inedible.   The tortellini pasta had an odd flavour that was overwhelming;  too strong of herb used.  The jambalaya was bland.   The acoustics are poor when the place is full and it got hot inside, almost stuffy.  Our server was very pleasant.  The ambiance was fine.  The place is  modern cozy.  The kitchen was a little overwhelmed with a full house.  As such service was slow.  The mixed drinks were good.  The appetizers were tasty.  But we probably would not return.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
Really enjoyed the food and ambiance at this place on Friday night. A small but excellent menu.,Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Amazing community gem.  The Belgravia Hub has been around for a while, and through those years they never disappoint. Whether it's delicious, fresh sandwiches for lunch or their more substantial dinner time menu, their dishes are always well thought out, they always use the freshest ingredients, and the quality is always consistent.  Went for dinner on their patio (which they did a great job setting up over the last year and a bit). I ordered the blackened chicken, my wife ordered the steak sandwich, and my son ordered the chicken tenders. Everything was so delicious. Steak was very tender and flavourful, chicken was perfectly seasoned on top of a bed of delicious garlic mash...even my kid's chicken tenders were great (made in house, crunchy batter and home made plum sauce and ketchup too!). We shared the peaches and cream creme br√ªl√©e (flavours change) and it was SO good. Loved the hint of almonds.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"It's been a while that I haven't written any reviews, so today I hope to catch up on a few since I have a block of time. I am starting with BH because despite how long ago I went with a friend, the memory still persists and I am very sorry to say it isn't a good one. I went with a friend on Nov. 1st, a Thursday evening (I made reservations for 6:30) and expected from the hubbub about this place that it would be busy. I got there on time, as did my friend and it was relatively quite with perhaps 5-7 occupied (mind you, I am being prudent because it was NOT noticeably AT ALL).
The server came over after a few minutes to greet us and also give us menus and tell us the specials. Once she returned (I would say about 15 minutes later) our orders were ready to be given: one order of fritters to share (5 of them), for my friend, the schnitzel and I ordered ordered the meatloaf on a chilly beginning of November.we ordered no drinks as we didn't feel like it, so you would think it wouldn't have been too complicated, nor too time consuming..... Our waitress came back within a reasonable time to bring the fritters...and quickly asked my friend's order again.  At this point, it's 7:30, we have well finished our appetizer (after all,how long does it take anyone to eat 5 fritters divided by 2?). We finally get the server's attention to ask about our entrees (by now it is 7:45) and I am sorry but the correct response to such a query is NOT, ""well, what time did you have your appetizer?"" --I am paraphrasing but I ASSURE you all this is how the scene went. At this response my friend was obviously upset and myself? Well, I was stunned. From this point, we finally got our entrees at a little before 8pm. Did I mention that the place was NOT crowded? Our server spent most of her evening casually going from table to table when it seemed the urge moved her.
Oh, I guess I should mention the quality of the food. It wasn't bad..... And NOT memorable. The fritters were the most gastronomically interesting part of our meal to be sure.
I'll include her comments to substantiate as she wrote her critique on Facebook:

That I went to the Belgravia Hub restaurant for dinner and it was the worst experience of my life...Worst service ever!!!!!!!
I went with my friend for dinner on a not too busy Thursday night, after taking our seats we ordered our food, only the waiter came back 10 minutes later to tell me that she had gotten distracted and had completely forgotten what I had ordered. We had our measly appetizer of tiny corn fritters to share (2 1/2 each) and 20 minutes after that the waitress removed our plates an did not even ask us whether we needed water or anything else. Dinner finally came when we quietly protested...an HOUR later. The waiter replied with a question, When did you finish eating your appetizer? of course then I told her that I would not be coming back, and as a long time neighbour I was really dissappointed I was not going to be able to refer this restaurant to anyone.
As a Belgravia neighbour, this treatment is inexcusable, I felt utterly mistreated, no apologies on her part whatsoever, I am NEVER setting a foot in this place again.

And there you have it..... Do I even have to state the likelihood of going back? Didn't think so ;-)",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Cute spot for a cozy restaurant. The interior is all leather and wood, dimly lit and oddly humid. We came in for a snack since we needed to be somewhere by 6, needed to eat but weren't super hungry. 

The only staff working the FOH offered us a table by the window but said she would needed it back by 6:30 since we had come in without a reservation. We knew we would be quick so that was fine. 

This place specializes in comfort food and you can tell by looking at the menu. Mac and cheese, shepherds pie, meatloaf, etc. The menu really made me want to come back again but much hungrier. 

We settled on everything cheese ball and the lemongrass pork meatballs. 

Everyone, you have to try the meatballs! They are delightfully flavoured with ginger, garlic and lemongrass and topped with a lightened sweet chilli sauce and crunchy wonton wrappers. The sweet chilli sauce appears and tasted like the bottled variety but it had been doctored up a little. I didn't care much for it but my husband liked it. It was nice to dip the wonton wrappers in.  

The everything cheese all was decidedly ok. Not amazing and not bad so just ok. The bacon flavour in it didn't really come through as much as I had hoped and it was rolled in poppy seed which was overpowering in the texture department. 

Our server was friendly and attentive even though it was starting to get busy in the restaurant and she was the only one working. 

I'll be back for sure and ready to try the entrees.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
Very nice restaurant near campus. Their jambalaya and braised beef were good when I had it ~1 year ago,Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Absolutely love this little spot. Their Corn fritters with the strawberry jam was super good. Not greasy, just good. I've been their twice and both times the food was fantastic and the service equally as good. Very friendly and an attentive staff. I remember this spot when it was the old bookstore.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
Great neighbourhood restaurant. Service was excellent and food was tasty. Definitely will come back.,Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Perfect every time!

Big fan of the rotating 'Kitchen Burger' and the fritters (bet you can't eat just one). Nice servers and a  good selection of reasonably beers, a great spot for a pint and a snack or a pre-theatre dinner.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Tucked away in the middle of a residential area and just a set over from the U of A hospital is this adorable little bistro with a gorgeous interior and a big comfy patio.

Prices are average to high. We tried the spinach dip ($12+$2 for extra chips) and I wanted both more dip and chips (or even pitas) for the price. The steak sandwich ($26) was well cooked and the chimmichurri was tasty, but high compare to other steak sandwiches we've had. It came with fries but maybe onions & mushrooms would go well here. Lastly, the daily special, meatloaf ($24) was really yummy but the portion of meatloaf itself was small for the price. Food quality was good, but there was a bit of a wait for our food. 

It's a beautiful space & a place where I would feel completely comfortable coming on my own for a drink - we saw quite a few tables of solo diners!",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"What a little gem this place is!  Seven of us dined there tonight before the Eagles concert. They are one block from the Belgravia/McKernan lrt. 
Three specials tonight -chicken & waffles, a seafood pasta and a burger with bacon and spicy cheese. 
Four of my companions had been there before and recommended everything!  Curry pot pie, meat loaf, burgers, salads. 
There was a single server managing the whole place until a 2nd person arrived after 6 pm. The fellow managed to handle a pretty full house on his own though. Good for him!
Three of us had the chicken& waffles with a corn relish on top. The acid of the relish really meshed with the chicken which has a slightly sweet sauce. Two large waffles were also on the plate - fluffy and flavourful!! I couldn't eat my 2 nd waffle but one of my companions enjoyed it. We also had the scallop and shrimp pasta, meatloaf and mash and the apricot chicken salad at our table. The portions are generous. My friends said the seafood was done perfectly and served in a white wine sauce. The meatloaf dinner was hearty and well seasoned. The apricot salad with chicken was defect for a warm evening.  Loved it all. Can't wait to go back!
While they don't have any outdoor seating their entire front windows open and it's like eating on a patio anyway.
Nice touch was the water glasses with a cucumber slice!!! It felt so summery!  Small but diverse beverage list  -something for everyone.  Do try this spot but better make a reservation!!
  Next time I go I am eating of the Starter menu. I want the corn fritters as a start and then the fried ravioli. Unless they have something yummy on special again....... Go there!",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Food was really disappointing. Burger tasteless. This is the worst burger I have had in a restaurant. Fries. Small broken potatoes and rather soggy. Poor service. Staff standing behind bar quite a bit. 
Won't be back for a long time. Now it's Saturday morning and I feel lousy. Bad food does that.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Highly recommend.  The food is excellent and reasonably priced.  Went w a couple of friends and we like to sample as much as possible of the menu.  The shared appetizers were an easy and delicious way to do this.  And the sample dessert portions also were great to diverse our choices.  Comfortable, casual and great ambience in a quiet neighborhood!",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"I was super-impressed with the look of the place when I walked in, and the food was even more spectacular.  My table ordered a bunch of appetizers -- lamb meatballs (my fave -- so good!), shrimp bruschetta, meaty cheesy flatbread and shoestring potatoes (we ended up ordering another bucket of these).  Everything was amazing -- I could have just eaten lamb meatballs all night and been very happy.  I do agree with Liv V. about the bread -- it's the one very small weak link.  My table then ordered salads, and I had the mixed green, which featured a hot poached egg on top, and it was one of the best salads I've ever had anywhere.  I've been recommending it to everyone I know and I can't wait to take more of my friends for what I know will be a great meal in a great place.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Tucked away off the beaten track we weren't sure what to expect. The restaurant is quite small, atmosphere pleasant, not overstated, simple yet tasteful. A nice neighborhood feel to it. 

We were initially a little disappointed by the small menu, but this didn't last. We all ordered different items and there was not a single complaint at our table. We were quite impressed by the food;  a shade above ""comfort food"" but with a comfort food price. Not only was it very good, they did not skimp on portions. In fact, as much as we all had our eyes on the inviting dessert options, we had no room left to eat more once our entrees were done.

The service was very pleasant, efficient, not rushed - I would certainly not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to friends. Not high-end, not elegant surroundings, just good food, good value, a pleasant atmosphere, pleasant staff - dinner out as it should be.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Have been meaning to try this place for a while as it is 5 minutes from home. Decor and atmosphere were lovely. The food was ok. We had the Jambalaya, Kitchen burger, one glass of beer and one glass of wine which came to $65. Comfort food with plenty of the meals having mashed potatoes. My burger was pretty good (which I had with a side of salad), the jambalaya however (no sides came with this) was less than expected. The food came quickly and the service was good. The one minor complaint is that the web site had their menus posted but there was a variety of items that were not on the menu that we received. I can see ourselves trying this again.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Lovely spot. Popular before shows at the Jubilee and they help make sure you get there on time. Reservations recommended as it was full on the Wed I attended. My friend enjoyed her large helping of cod stew. My salmon and rice was mild and bland. Color was added by garnish of slices of cucumber and grated carrots, but no other veg accompaniment. Would try something different next time, like one of 3 salads with salmon add on. Their meatloaf is popular and was sold out early. Minimal parking.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"Ordered take out. Chicken sandwich special was excellent. The artichoke dip was creamy and delicious. Teriyaki Salmon was cooked just right. Accompanying noodles and veggies were good. Jambalaya was good, but not exciting. It was our family's first experience, and in less than a week our kids have already asked to go again.",Iw7uhUS9D5gXESPr_DVHaA
"My friend and I stayed here a few months ago when we visited Edmonton for a concert. We were pleasantly surprised with the convenient location and the free parking! The hotel lobby is small but very cute and the friendly staff made for a quick check-in. One of the drivers gave us a ride to Rogers Place since we were running late and it was only a 10-15 minute walk to the hotel so we walked on the way back. 

The room we were in was clean but on the smaller side. The only thing I had a problem with was the bathroom door. There was a sliding bathroom door that didn't even close properly. That's a little weird when you're sharing a room. I was going to request a different room (if they even had any with regular doors) but we figured we were barely spending any time in the room so it should be fine. 

They also offered complimentary in room wi-fi. As well as complimentary breakfast which we didn't go to but that's always nice!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"second time we stayed here and the hotel is super nice, clean, and modern. will definately be returning. great place to stay for concerts at rexall as its a quick block walk to the LRT station. Room service was tasty. And wifi works great, also has shaw go wifi there.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Overall, for the price, I was unimpressed with this hotel. I've had larger rooms, a better view, and better service at much cheaper places. Granted, it is a great location for business in downtown Edmonton, but I would rather walk a few extra blocks to the office than stay here again.

Major complaints: 
-the wait for the elevator in the morning was over 10 minutes. I finally ended up taking the stairs, which exit onto the street, and re-entering the hotel from the front to get to breakfast.
-the soundproofing is poor in the guest rooms. Noise from the elevators, other guest rooms, maid service, etc. was clearly heard in the room throughout the night

Minor complaints: 
-the TV remote was complicated to work, and I had to get 'tech support' to come fix it
-the sheets aren't great; a hotel of this 'caliber' could provide a better thread count
-the view is awful. I get that it's in downtown, but the roof of a building isn't a great view. Worse, the building had skylights, and the lights inside the building shone out all night, right through the curtains.
-The room was tiny, and definitely showing signs of wear. Even small repairs, such as the caulking around the tub and grout in the bathroom, do not say 'boutique hotel' but 'DIY renovations'

Positives:
-the staff were friendly, although the entire interaction was very scripted both at check-in and check-out
-the breakfast is included, and was fairly decent, even had some hot items which I did not have. yogurt, granola, fruit, pastries, cereal, juice, etc.
-there were lots of pillows, and the wireless worked well.

In conclusion, I would prefer to pay less and feel like I was getting good value than to pay this much and feel like it was a rip-off, despite the great location.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I recently stayed at the Matrix for two nights. I visit Edmonton 1-2 times each year, so I'm down with the YEG options.

The hotel itself has similar amenities to Meterra on Whyte, only Matrix has a prime downtown location whereas Meterra is in Old Strathcona. Both have big lobbies with a fireplace, courtesy guest area on the second floor with complimentary wine hour, rooms offer views of the city, even similar toiletries in the bathrooms.

The one big difference? The staff. Front desk at Matrix feels like they're too cool for school. Not in a Ace Hotel kind of way, more of a ""I really don't care if you are here right now"" feeling. Do I require a warm hug and escort to my room? No! But don't roll your eyes when I can't get my room key to work in the elevator either.

Also the housekeeping staff seemed to be permanently parked/working outside my room. Perhaps it was the time of day I was coming and going? I always decline the tidy up and leave a tip at the end of my stay. Wonder what was going down in the rooms next to mine...

It wasn't a bad experience - the hotel is centrally locates, comfy amenities and it's safe. Those are the most important things in hotels anywhere. I'd rather stay elsewhere upon returning to Edmonton.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Reasonably satisfied with this hotel. Plenty of options on the breakfast buffet, which is included in the room price. Free WiFi accessible from all areas of the hotel as well as LAN in the rooms. Although don't expect to stream Netflix ... my test with Speedtest.net yields a scant 2 mbps. 

Rooms are clean. Hallway noise is typical. Stocked mini bar is fine if you don't mind spending $3.50 for a Coke, $3.00 for a pack of M&M's or $35 for a cheap bottle of wine...but at least they made the effort.

To be honest my only real complaint is the shower heads. As of right now this is my 2nd stay and both times the shower heads have proved to be really crappy. The pressure is so weak that it takes 3x as long to wash shampoo out of your hair...I can't imagine how a woman with long hair would manage at all. If I stay here next time, I'm seriously considering bringing my own shower head and just switch it out myself. I get that everyone wants to save water these days but there comes a point when you have to say, ""enough!"".

Other than that, I like this hotel. But for my next trip I will consider trying someplace new...the shower heads really are that bad and sours the entire experience that would otherwise be top notch.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"This is a high value hotel.  It is modern, clean, great location to public transportation, shopping and restaurants.  We found the complimentary breakfast very nice and preferred eating at the MZ lounge for dinner vs. going out.  The dinner menu has a nice selection, delicous and well priced.  Really appreciated the ability to skip room clean and receive a credit.  The staff is professional and special thanks to the Front Office Manager Jay S. for his gracious and personal assistance in providing us great directions around the city.  We highly recommend it.

"The Matrix hotel has always been one of my favorite places in Edmonton, despite not having the chance to stay as a guest until very recently. My cousin got married here a few years ago and it was a gorgeous venue for such an event. A few years later a friend of mine used the rooms for her & her bridesmaids (that's me!) to get ready before her ceremony. More recently, I visited Edmonton for work and finally had the chance to stay in this hotel as a guest. They have a complimentary wine & cheese from 5:30pm - 6:30pm, which was perfect after a Red Arrow bus ride up from Calgary. Rooms are big and spacious, front desk staff is friendly and attentive, and the hotel is located centrally so it's very easy to get anywhere downtown or across the river. Their breakfast buffet is AMAZING -- easily the best out of downtown hotels. At ~$200/night staying at the Matrix isn't always easy on the wallet, but you get what you pay. I love the Matrix and highly recommend to anyone visiting Edmonton for work or pleasure!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I stayed here for work a couple months ago. Great rooms, very modern, helpful staff. Sadly maids are very noisy in the morning. Starting around 8am I could hear them in the hallway socializing and laughing this went on for at least an hour. Also had a  lukewarm shower around 11am when getting ready.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Free parking, free breakfast, free bikes
They had big modern rooms.
Two elevators and they took a while.
The food was good and had a large selection of wine by glass.
The gym decent and location was spot on.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Unaccustomed to free parking at a hotel, I was impressed that they offered it. Even more impressive is the lobby. It's funky, clean and modern, yet it's still somehow inviting and warm. The rooms are fairly standard with nice touches like pretty reliable wi-fi, robes, tea, and a mini fridge with complimentary water.

I do have a couple of questions. One, what's with the bathroom door? Perhaps it's is just the room I stayed in, but the last thing I want to do is to wake up staring at the toilet. Yes, closing the pocket door to the loo will take care of that, but come on, that didn't come up at all during the design phase? And two - perhaps I'm tech challenged (having never owned a satellite TV) but does the ""high tech"" remote need to be more frustrating than setting the time on a 1990 VCR? Heed my warning: if you channel surf to high or too low you might wind up on a ""games"" station - exit - nowhere! Or you'll be in music central - again with no exit in sight. I just want to watch Law and Order gosh darn it ;p

Next time I'm going to work my darnedest to get a room on a higher level. In a flat town, the last thing you want to be looking at is someone else's roof.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I am a road warrior, and a Westin-lover... However:

I love the Matrix! I have now spent 2 stints her over the past couple of years, and it's just as great as I remember. It's the perfect downtown boutique-y (but not too niche) place to stay if you want a breather from the Westin/Hotel Mac crowd.

I give Matrix the belt based on a few items:
+ trendy rooms | beds are low to the ground, so might not be good for the elderly folk
+ amazing free breakfast | think eggs prepared 2 ways, oatmeal, yogurt and granola bar, cappuccino machine, assorted pastries, and life-changing cinnamon buns
+ location, location, location
+ all staff are curiously friendly
+ FREE parking | no car? use Uber

I only have one small, teenie, tiny beef - As mentioned above, there is an amazing free buffet style breakfast, with friendly staff greeting you on your way in. Great. As soon as I sat down one of the staff members brought a billfold to my table saying ""whenever you're ready"", a bit caught off guard (because I was told this was included with the cost of the room), I opened it to see it was zeroed out, and was simply an opportunity to leave a gratuity.

Having worked in the hospitality industry for a long time, I thought this was in poor taste. I'm all for gratuities when appropriate; but in a self-serve buffet that it loudly touted as included in the room, I didn't like this. Rant over.

Overall: Stay at Matrix, you won't regret it.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"My second trip to Edmonton and I decided to abandon the larger chain hotels and go boutique. This ended up being a great decision, as The Matrix was top notch in every way. The bed was super comfy and large, the staff was very friendly, the location is central to so many good restaurants, and the rates were reasonable. If I have to come back up here on business I will definitely stay again!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Overall I like the Matrix.  It's a nice hotel on the surface, has been modernly appointed, and everything is basically nice.  My experience checking in was problematic, but the staff was mostly friendly.  I got smiles and greetings whenever i passed them.

The room was pleasant, bed comfortable, and everything clean without needing me to ask for anything extra. My only complaint was the low powered Air conditioning, which just couldn't keep up with even Spring heat in Northern Alberta.

The restaurant was crowded for breakfast, but mostly quiet outside of their wine and cheese time of the evening.  It was semi-comfortable, has a reasonable selection of food that isn't absolutely ridiculously priced.

Unfortunately A/C is one of my must haves for a comfortable stay, so I won't be choosing the Matrix a second time.

"Our room was lovely. The only downside is that during booking we saw that there is ""Free parking,"" but when we got there we still had to pay $20 for parking one night.  The complimentary breakfast was nice though. Another note, no complimentary wine and cheese currently. I was told that it is temporarily unavailable, I can only assume it's due to covid.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
Elevator was broken only 1 of 2 worked ..the working elevator was very slow and the cleaning staff were constantly using it which delayed pick up and drop off. The waterfall in the front was not working. The breakfast was not good at all. No bacon ? Very basic breakfast which had odd things that most people don't want to try in it and I am not picky.   The hotel did offer coffee free of charge in the room and it was clean and half modern. The location is walking distance from downtown restaurants. There is outdoor covered parking. Probably 45 min away from the airport.,JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Clean hotel, friendly staff, superb location, lovely amenties.

I was so impressed with my stay here. Check in was a breeze. My room was clean, comfortable and had everything i needed except an oven: but who wants that on a staycation.

I stayed in the sterling suite for almost a week, and the weekdays were more expensive than the weekend rates. The atmosphere here is business casual, lots of government employees and business cliente. Absolutly no children in sight. 

The room was modern and sleek, my issues were the dim lighting. Even the desk was poorly lit but during the day, the wall to wall window views of dt kept the room bright. I was surprised that my room had a fridge, sink, microwave and complete wet bar. Our living room even had a nice sofabed. Came with slippers for 2 and complimentary voss water daily. 

Housekeeping was great, except for 1 day they skipped our room for no apparent reason. I loved the fragrant soaps and shampoos here. 

The best part of our stay was the daily buffet breakfast and the wine tasting with cheese. I loved it. It was perfect pre dinner appetizers since it was from 530-630. The automatic latte/cappacino machine was awesome! I loved it.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA

A nice alternative if the usual suspects are full. Not much on the service side and there is wear starting to show in some rooms.,JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I really enjoyed this hotel. The staff were very friendly and I loved the layout of the room. My room had it's own bar sink, and living room and this helped to make it feel more like home rather than just a hotel room. They had an excellent breakfast in the morning and it was conveniently located above a Starbuck's and The Wildflower Grill which are both places I enjoy. 

I would definitely recommend this place for friends and family.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I just came from a two night stint at the Matrix and I was very pleased with the accommodations - especially considering the moderate prices.

I arrived at 2am on Sunday night / Monday morning after a late flight out of PHX, and thank goodness my room was ready and my bed was comfy.  I passed out that first night!  I was a little bit more awake then next day and night and enjoyed the complimentary breakfast both Monday and Tuesday mornings.  (It's included in your room rate and there is something for everyone including plenty of hot food options such as eggs, bacon, potatoes, and oatmeal as well as fresh fruit, yogurt, muffins, toast, hard boiled eggs, cereal, etc...)

I found the Matrix staff to be friendly and the location to be central and convenient.  Nice bathroom amenities, a hot shower with great pressure, and a powerful hairdryer all added to the experience as well.  Unfortunately, I didn't make it to the fitness center on this trip, but it's nice to know it's there for future visits.

The only confusing things were the wifi and the TV.  The wifi is free and it worked for me most of the time on my computer but not on my phone.  The TV was way too difficult to figure out and I gave up on that after a few tries.  

Bottom line: if you're looking for a moderately priced hotel in Edmonton, you can't go wrong with the Matrix!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Front desk staff is outstanding. Once my id was shown they offered up some outstanding recommendations on what to do around the area. They went above and beyond. The hotel itself is very nice with a modern flair. Both the lobby and my room did not disappoint. I'm a Hilton loyalist but in Canada they just don't compete. The Marriott down the street I didn't want to step foot into. 

First stop, free wine tasting and cheese upstairs on the patio.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"We stayed here this past weekend while we were in town for the Brad Paisley concert. Close to the LRT, wonderful service, and the complimentary breakfast is a great way to start the morning! We ordered room service for supper. One of the orders were wrong (asked for no onions on the burger and instead received no mushrooms and a lot of onions). We left a note on the tray when we left it outside our room after our meal and when we received our bill the next morning, they deducted $6 off our bill! This was our 2nd stay at the Matrix Hotel and we will be returning again in the future!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Traveling with a bad cold is not fun...I was totally that person full of germs that I typically avoid on planes. Fortunately once I arrived in Edmonton (after passing my germs to everyone on the plane) the Matrix Hotel provided me with a clean spacious room and a comfortable bed so I could get a little bit of rest during my short trip.

Overall, I liked this hotel and wouldn't definitely stay here again. My colleague and I were in town to do interviews and they have a nice lounge upstairs that was the perfect spot for them (and it helped that it was empty too). 

It's also centrally located near lots of restaurants, shops and more...so there's no need to rent a car in what I believe is typically a driving city.

The restaurant downstairs was also solid if you happen to visit during one of Edmonton's infamous cold winters.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
Fantastic stay. Everyone at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. The room was great. Lots of space and very homely. With rogers place just up the street it was a perfect location as well.,JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Good location for a primarily business hotel.

Rooms are modern in design and decently-sized.

Nice touches: apples at front desk, complimentary deluxe continental breakfast (with potatoes and eggs every morning), complimentary wine-and-cheese each evening, with two samples per guest. The automated De Houtte beverage machine is fun, but don't expect it to produce an award-winning latte.

Some downsides, however.

Limited parking, covered but still outdoors. (Not ideal for -40 degrees!)

Picky about late check-out, they told me ""1 p.m. at the latest,"" which was okay - until they advised me I still had to move my car by noon to the pay lot next door!

As a business hotel, minimal amenities with a tiny fitness centre carved out of two guest rooms, and a surprisingly small business centre.

Overall, not bad, but certainly not a vacation spot.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I won't add much as I agree with all other comments regarding the hotel. My only disappointment is the MZ Lounge which is over priced for what you receive. 

As well, as nice as the breakfast is, it doesn't open until 730 am on the weekend. Not a great opening time if you are in town for an event or have to work.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I haven't stayed at the Matrix since 2012, but only because I rarely have meetings downtown anymore! Things that are great about this place:
- renovated rooms 
- free wine and cheese on weekdays from 530-630
- complimentary breakfast buffet
- good location if you have to do business in downtown Edmonton!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Staying at boutique hotels in Canada always reminds me of why I love to travel to the US. ""boutique"" in Canadian speak translates to ""no service, steep price, untrained employees, nice fireplace and art in lobby, and an old apartment painted black and grey to pretend to be a high end hotel suite"". 
Upon arrival, I pulled in front in my 4 inch heal loubitons and found no doorman. Inhad to pull my suitcase through 2 feet of  ice and snow. I was told there is usually a bellman but since the hotel was not at capacity this fine icy snowy valentine weekend, they choose not offer this service to the rest of us suckers who decided to stay here instead of the hotel Mac (which would have been a comparable price). 
The room was nothing special and very basic.  The walls were paper thin and we had the unfortunate luck of being next to a very loud guy.  It's too gross to go into details but let's just say he gave the entire floor a play by play of his partners actions.   
The breakfast was decent bur upon checkout, we sat in the lobby which is pretty from afar, but upon closer inspection, the coffee tables were scratched and dented and the sofa was the most uncomfortable contraption I've ever sat in. Come on, how much would it coat to replace the plywood tables?  Oh, almost forgot about the elevator, there wad an inside panel missing so the door from the inside wAs just plywood. I thought I entered the staff or freight elevator.  Another example of boutique hotel equals pretty on the outside, lacking on the details.  I've learned my lesson, the only boutique hotel I will ever stay at is the W hotel.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I am here now.  Paper thin walls. One of the loudest nights I have spent in a hotel in a long time.  Don't get anything on the 3 or 4th floor.  If those are the only rooms they have, go somewhere else!   I am right across from the elevator, the ice machine, and the fitness room is right underneath me.  NOISE all night.   I will never stay here again.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I must have lucked out and dodged the noisy floor! 

Very quiet for my week long stay. 

The Matrix is a great hotel located in a Bitchin part of downtown. You can walk to just about anything you need from here. Surrounded by great food and pubs. 

Big plus for me is the FREE parking. Not very common downtown. Staff is great and very accommodating. 

A convenient bar/lounge with a quaint biz center. 

Big 5 star from me.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"The Matrix is a fantastic locally owned boutique hotel! We stayed the night for my birthday. The extremely pleasant experience started with a complimentary upgrade of our room. 

Then we were invited to a wine tasting for guests at 5:30. 

We also had dinner in the lounge. I had the bison braised ribs and my wife had the fish. Both were absolutely amazing. The bison pulled right of the bone! 

After a walk in downtown we returned to our room to just veg out for the night. The suite was so relaxing and comfortable.  

A fantastic place. Highly recommended.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I was at the Matrix Hotel all day on May 31st for a set of meetings. I was one of the facilitators but didn't organize or plan any of the logistics at the hotel.

Positives:
- Great service. We had a problem in the room where it was too cold. I asked someone for help and it was solved within 5 minutes. We also didn't get a projector (not the hotel's fault) but the hotel removed the projector table quickly so it wouldn't be in our way.
- Fruit tray provided in the morning for a snack. Was very yummy.
- Right next door to a Starbucks, which also had great service.
- Nice meeting room. Good size for our purposes. Liked that it had a whiteboard.
- The Wildflower Grill is accessible via the hotel lobby and is a great restaurant.

Negatives:
- There's no inside path to the Starbucks!
- Parking appears to be free only for overnight guests and not for guests attending a meeting.
- I sent an email to the hotel to ask about parking and it took them quite a bit of time to respond.

It looks like a nice place to stay, but I'm sure it's expensive.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"To start, as the photos prove when I walked in the beds were very not well made and it didn't make me want to stay here. It looked as though the cleaner just threw the blanket back over and they were lumpy and didn't look nice. 
Not only that- where they claim the beds are queens they were definitely no bigger than doubles. Very hard for two people to sleep in a bed. 
My room on the 7th floor was right beside the elevator so it was loud all night and I mean right by the elevator. 
When I went to shower- the shower looked as though somebody had recently showered and I didn't get to the hotel until 11:00pm ... it was wet and there was hair ... 
my keurig machine when I opened it in the morning to make a green tea had an old smelly coffee from the last guest in there 
Then wen I called for a car service and the hotel says they provide that I wanted for the morning the woman at reception said the car service doesn't start until 4:00pm ... so it's more of an evening. At service then a day or morning car service . What good is it in the evening when I need to get to places and meetings in the morning ? 
The only thing that saved this place is the continental free breakfast as they aren't your typical one with waffles and pancakes - they have eggs Benedict etc.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"BRING EARPLUGS
I've stayed here a few times over the last several years, and it does not seem to get better each time. 
Breakfast is decent, but often there is nowhere to sit. 
The fancy cappuccino machine is gone,  replaced with regular coffee. It used to be nice, but time has not been terribly kind to this place. The beds are getting worn, things just aren't as fresh as they used to be. 
And the earplugs. . . . The walls are paper thin, you can hear your neighbor peeing. :(",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Cute stylish rooms, crisp linens and very comfy beds. Spent two nights here and really enjoyed ourselves. Comp breakfast, wine and cheese hour (we didn't make it) ro service. It was great. The supervisor Thomas was fantastic and made us feel very welcome. If I had to go to Edmonton again I 100% would stay here",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"This review isn't based on an overnight stay at Matrix Hotel, but based on attending various conferences at the hotel.  I like the open lobby with lots of seating when you first walk in which is great for a quiet area to make a quick phone call or to wait for someone.  Closed to the front desk, there's a small display indicating what events are taking place in what ballroom.

Upon heading up the stairs, there's a hallway to the left or right leading to the rooms.  I have attended events in the rooms to the right.  The layout is great to allow for registration tables to be set up and the washrooms are close by.  The washrooms are nice and then have comfortable hand towels and the soap well stocked

The room was set up with tables and chairs and a podium and table at the front.  It's great there's a large screen for a PowerPoint presentation as well.  For the event, there was light food and beverages at the back of the room.  The staff were working hard to make sure the cups and plates were promptly removed and ensuring there was no shortage for people to use.

On a warm day, the temperate in the room was cool but comfortable.  The details were taken care of and made for a comfortable and great event.  Thanks Matrix for always being a great venue for an event!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I am in love with this hotel in Edmonton.
Why:
- free parking 
- great concierge service
- beautifully modern and clean lobby with fresh fruit for the taking
- cute suites with nice amenities (wi-fi, robes, complimentary water)

The prices are reasonable and its a really nice place to stay.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I have stayed here twice for multi-day trips to Edmonton. Sounds trivial but this hotel has very slow elevators & a lack of elevators (you end up spending a lot of time waiting for the elevator or being in the elevator, and the stairs take you outside, not to the lobby). The first time I stayed here one elevator was out of service and it was a disaster. They also charged our credit card for Mini Bar items we didn't use on my first trip! 

Both times I have stayed here my room has been across from the elevator and have been woken up in the early morning by other guests heading downstairs as walls are far from sound proof (you can hear everything that goes on in the hallway, even the elevator changing floors). Bathrooms do not have fans. Mattress in the room on my second visit was very hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. There is also no underground parking.

However, funky decor, good gym, clean rooms, great location, and tasty free continental breakfast. While they have done their best, the reality is that this is an old building and at best a three star hotel. As it was noisy again on my second stay (and the elevator issue & hard mattress was annoying) I am not sure if at worth the $$$$/ night and I will look into other options next time I'm in Edmonton.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Visiting a friend while she is staying at The Matrix downtown Edmonton.  As you enter the the hotel the lobby and exterior is beautiful and welcoming.  My friend got upgraded to a premium suite which is pretty awesome.  Huge bathroom with a large shower. There's a soaker tub with jets.  Everything is open and kept so clean and tidy.  They provide complimentary wine tasting and cheeses for their happy hour from 5:30pm to 6:30pm ( end time may be incorrect).  

We ordered room service to share, we got a charcuterie board. Holy crap this board is jam packed with amazing meats and cheeses.  One of the best ones I've seen for only $25.  I'm impressed by that alone.  They did not skimp of the food.  Our server who brought it up was so sweet and kind.  

I can't find a single negative thing to say.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Really great hotel.  Stayed here for 4 nights last week.  Room was great.  Bed was super comfortable and shower had great pressure most of the time.  Free wifi that worked very well.  They have a great included breakfast in the morning and happy hour at 530.  Location is really good.  They offer the use of two Marin bikes in excellent conditions with locks and helmets.  We used these twice to explore the city and was a great added benefit.  The service was great and everyone was really friendly and helpful.  Only two very minor issues: 1. The a/c was not particularly strong in the room so if you like it super cool during the summer, this could be an issue on very hot days.  2.  Parking is free but the lot is a bit tight.  
Highly recommended and I will definitely try to stay here again on my next trip to Edmonton.  At 199 Canadian per night this was a very fair price.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Attended a very nice afternoon speaker and dinner here. The design is very trendy and the concept is different than most other meeting spaces in the city. If I could give one tip it would simply be to dress up a bit otherwise you may feel somewhat out of place. Again this is another review of a hotel where I cannot comment on the rooms or the experience of staying overnight; however, I can say that the parts of the hotel I was in were very nice. 

Supper was yummy and the bar was well stocked. Servers were polite and mostly did their jobs without bothering the company. Our speaker was using an amplification system that worked great and helped boosted his vocal range without overdoing the sound levels.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Really enjoyed our stay here, the room was modern and comfortable and the breakfast was delicious! Parking lot is a bit tight and usually full, but we did manage to find a spot each night.  We ate at the Wildflower which was good but a touch overpriced. Overall I would definitely stay here again.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"They help you hold a great party.

It is a little bit upscale and completely fun. The location is great, though a few people at the party I attended complained about the lack of parking. They hotel itself has a lot as well as 2 larger lots behind it. Part of the hotel's parking for the guests is covered which is nice in winter. There is ample parking. If you are the type who for some insane reason hates downtown Edmonton or even the $3.00 to pay for evening/weekend parking, maybe it isn't for you. The party converted a lot of people to really liking the downtown atmosphere.

The buffet was nicely presented and delicious. The carving stations were staffed, the people never once went missing. The dessert options were plentiful. The bar was stocked well. They have ticket options for parties, if that is something you need. There were a couple other parties happening while ours was and there was no cross over noise. We forgot they were there. 

If you are staying the night, they have a wine and cheese nightly and breakfast in the morning. The lobby is always neat and clean and a welcome place to meet people and wait for rides. There are plenty of places to relax on the mezzanine level in addition to the lobby. The rooms were clean and updated. They were a real treat! 

I have been recommending anyone staying in Edmonton for the night or longer to give the hotel a shot!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"With all the hype I've heard about the matrix, I was excited to try it out on my recent trip to Edmonton. Check in was smooth and the staff were friendly and helpful. But then I got to my room:

- no clock radio (I had to ask for one)
- the tub stopper wouldn't stay open during my shower. I had to wedge it open with a wash cloth
- the water for my shower was warm at best, not hot
- the TP location is just in the wrong and awkward location
- my room door was the only door on the floor with a hydraulic close assist, making it bang shut if I didn't catch it

For the price, I expected more. At best, I'd describe it as adequate. I have better (and cheaper) options just a few blocks away for my next business trip to YEG. I won't be in a rush to go back.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I really enjoyed this little boutique hotel. The decor was funky, modern, and clean looking, and the service was fantastic. I especially liked the complimentary wine and cheese party in early evening; that was a great way to kick back for my first night in the hotel. The breakfast the next morning was also great: there was hot food along with yogurt, fresh fruit, and custom coffees (although the machine needed some love because the mocha was watery). Nevertheless the food was great and I felt very taken care of.

This hotel would be great for a group as the hospitality room is an excellent place to meet (although by the time the elevators finally arrive Uncle Bernie may have forgotten your name again).

Parking was a little ghetto, but free.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I stayed here for 2 nights while in Edmonton on business and I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised.  

The outside structure is unpretty- you can tell it was once a motel or holiday inn-  but the cons stop there.

The service was excellent, I hosted an event there and the staff were helpful, courteous and very friendly.  The decor inside is modern, with attention to detail.  My only gripe is that the excellent restaurant attached to the hotel isn't ""part"" of the hotel so you cannot order room service from there.. But I was told that might change.  Also, I didn't love the free breakfast.  But as far as free breakfast goes, it's pretty damn good.

I would just rather pay and get a better breakfast.  

I would most definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again.  And that says a lot since I used to review 4 and 5 star hotels for a living.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I stayed here partially at the recommendation of a colleague & partially because my usual spot was sold out for the week.  Matrix Hotel was nice, I could tell that the property itself was a bit old (ceilings were super low, bathroom was tiny), but had been renovated in the past.  The room was nice, super modern with a platform bed decorated in grey, red, white & black.  They offered satellite service which was also really good, lots of channels to choose from.  My only complaint is that the wireless internet was AWFUL, absolutely awful.  When I called down to the front desk they were really no help in getting the issue resolved.  The free breakfast was awesome, lots of options to choose from.  Also they have a daily wine & cheese ""tasting"" event - make sure you hit that up - who doesn't love free wine?!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"My dear friend came to Canada and we stayed at the Matrix hotel near Jasper. Love this hotel - it has such modern decor with vaulted ceilings and crystals. Got love those crystals! Anyways, the rooms were like the lobby, modern and clean with comfy beds and pillows. Carports were closeby and Jasper with all of its restaurants and bars were not too far away! 

I think my favorite part was the complimentary breakfast in the morning. Great selection of gourmet foods including freshly baked bread, variety of eggs, meats, oatmeal and many more. 

Great hotel to showcase what Edmonton has to offer: location, modern style and good food. My friend and I had a great stay. :)",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Duty Manager Thomas Springston took swift action when through a series of errors I arrived for my convocation banquet a day late, family in tow and freshly soaked from a thunderstorm. I was in great distress! He whisked us up to the lounge and offered us a courtesy meal at the hotel's expense. The service and food were both excellent quality, and we left with the incident tucked away as a silly memory that turned out happy. I will be bringing friends to the Matrix lounge and recommending it to out of town colleagues forever!!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I wish there was a way to go with 2.5 stars.  The hotel is average, but with modern decor and friendly staff.  The pluses would be soft pillows, nice toiletries, friendly staff, decent breakfast.  Negatives are small room, hollow doors, poor noise insulation, terrible parking, and dirty room/poor maintenance of rooms.

If you know Edmonton, this is one of the better values considering the comp breakfast.  If you're trying to add a little variety to the usual Hilton, Starwood mix this is a good choice.  Just go in knowing the downside in advance.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"The Matrix Hotel is a small boutique hotel similar to the Sofitel chain.

 It is centrally located downtown close to government offices and the Legislature and walking distance from the city's downtown tourist & foodie spots.

We were welcomed at the front desk by two  very nice and good humoured staff members who engaged us in small talk. They gave us lots of ideas regarding how we could enjoy our ""staycation"" in Edmonton.

With your room, you get to enjoy a daily wine and cheese sampling in the hotel's hospitality room. Which really is not a room but more like a bright, sunny lounge. The sampling is far from a sampling as they serve you full glasses of wine & there is a buffet with a variety of cheeses and crackers, dips & chips. You can help yourself as often as you would like. The wine is also replenished.

Looking for a place to have dinner, we enquired at the front desk. They were extremely helpful with many suggestions.

The hot continental breakfast was generous but nothing to write home about taste-wise. There was a variety of muffins, croissants, pastries, small bagels & French bread served with assorted jams & butters. Fruit kabobs, yogurt, granola, dried fruits & oatmeal. Chorizo sausage, two types of frittatas, & seasoned potatoes. 

Not sure what kind of fat was used in the pastries & croissant but it had a lard flavour and stuck to your mouth. The frittata was quite dry. 

BUT, the breakfast being complimentary with your room, one cannot complain. Better than your average continental freebie at other hotels!

As for the room... We were given a room facing the elevator. I was concerned about noise due to previous experience in other hotels. To my pleasant surprise, the room was quite soundproof. 

And the bed! So comfortable! Nice, crisp linen, soft pillows, medium support mattress. Slept like a baby and woke up without a sore back!

I would highly recommend this hotel to out of town visitors or for a nice staycation!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Great service, friendly staff, great room service and food... the only thing that could have been better was the comfortability of the sheets... they could've had a higher thread count, especially with the cold winter weather and the dryness.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"This hotel is THE WORST.  Everything looks good - until you scratch the surface.  Got treated poorly when ever complaints were raised (filthy rooms, no towels, tv never worked, nor did thermostat in -33 degree weather!!)

All shine and NO substance.  Would rather stay in a Holiday Inn than give them more money.

They are trading on the word boutique hotel - which this is not.",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Travelled to Edmonton for the Michael Buble concert and my first stay at The Matrix. Our room was clean, shower hot, lots of towels, bed great, really quiet on 9th floor even though ice machine close by as well as elevator (week nite stay) and all staff we encountered were efficient, friendly and looking to help.
We missed the wine tasting as already had reservations but concierge was quick to offer ""Ian"" the driver if we needed a ride to our restaurant..next trip for sure!
Breakfast was excellent - hot bacon, hot eggs, make your own toast, great fruit platter, yogurt, and various coffee options!

Will definitely be back when we come for Elton John concert in Sept!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"Okay, sometimes I'm not sure why I'm so comfortable staying here. But I am. And I prefer to stay here than anywhere else.

See, it's got a modern feel. A boutique feel. The Matrix certainly isn't luxurious, but it has everything I need. Including a younger professional crowd than other hotels in Edmonton. Extremely comfortable beds. Clean rooms. There's a great warm breakfast buffet included. And wine in the evening. I guess these are the things that make my stay as comfortable as it always is.

Really the only two factors that bother me a little are: 1) there is no service elevator. Guests have to share the two elevators with staff who, understandable, use it quite a bit. 2) Um, and my stay might be a little pricy for the services offered...although I might also just be cheap (keep in mind I do continue to return to this hotel).",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"I can see the potential for a good experience at The Matrix, but ours was ruined by the front desk assistant, ""S"". I checked in and asked S for help bringing in baggage. He nodded toward the baggage cart, but made no move to help me. Once we brought our things in, S was exceedingly rude and condescending, treating us as though we'd never stayed in a hotel before. I think The Matrix has a big fish/little pond thing going on (I think it's probably one of the most high-end hotels in Edmonton), but they could definitely benefit from a major ego-check. We stayed in a Platinum Suite, which was adequate but not amazing. I've stayed in hotels around the world and this was by far the worst customer service I've experienced. Finally, be aware that the parking is above ground and uncovered, so not ideal for winter!",JI3-QZwm6vihIFBcekgyaA
"We were super intrigued when we saw the sign for burger village we had to stop in. The sign reads plant based, grass-fed burgers, and exotic burgers. A great selection for everyone. We went in at around 12 and there was one other table in the place. It felt cold and super quiet so we ended up asking if we could take it to go. We went with a skinny chicken sandwich with the house salad and the classic hot dog with cajun fries. They have local beer on tap which is a great feature and the blonde beer the waitress suggested was great. The food came out in a timely manner and we took it home which isn't far. The fries and spicy mayo sauce that came with them were great. The chicken sandwich was super disappointing. The chicken was filled with a small gristly piece of chicken and had nearly no arugula on it and a few tiny pieces of red pepper. I ended up throwing it away. My husband said his hot dog was super chewy with a weird texture. The sandwiches were disappointing to be honest. 

The only reason I'm giving them a three is because the staff was super kind, local beer on tap, and the space is super clean and cute. I wouldn't go here again though. For the price tag the quality wasn't there and I was really hoping to like this place.",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"I've eaten from here twice, once as dine-in and once as take out. Although not a fan of having to
sign up on their website to order from the menu, the options are fantastic if you are looking for something different/unique in terms of patties and for specific burger add-ons. I'm not overly adventurous, so I've tried the boar & the beef burger, basic fries and onion rings. It's a lot of food for one person if you order fries with your burger, but I definitely feel that I got my money's worth for what I paid for re: I could only comfortably finish half in one sitting if I ate a combo with drink. I definitely recommend ordering ahead of time if you are planning to pick up an order. As dine-in, the server was super friendly and attentive; and if you check-in with Yelp, there is an offer. I should also mention, they have a swell selection of soda flavours too!",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Stopped for lunch on the way around Edmonton and it was great! Chose to eat here for their gluten free options (I have celiac) and it exceeded expectations. I had a grilled chicken burger and Cajun fries while my hubby had the bison burger. Delicious food, great options, and friendly service. We'll definitely be stopping through again!",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Discovered this restaurant today and the choice of burgers and toppings is fantastic, quality is outstanding! Enjoyed the neat burger of my life. Service and decor are great for a casual experience.",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Trying to be fancy burgers.   They were super dry and underwhelming, especially for the price.",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Noticed this place in Windermere and have been meaning to check it out. I went in on a Sunday night before closing and was warmly greeted and explained the menu. The place is spotless, very nice decor. I just tried the regular beef burger but looking forward to trying the other burgers. The food was absolutely perfect. As fresh as it gets. Good portions and great taste. I encourage everyone to support this place and dine in for the full experience instead of ordering it via Skip the Dishes!!",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"During the summer I took my daughter here on a date. From the moment we walked in we were welcomed by the owner and I am assuming his family. The atmosphere is inviting. The menu states a few different options of burgers. I had opted for one on the menu that was beef, and asked to exchange the beef patty for turkey. The server indicated I'd have to pay extra. Which I wasn't thrilled about and just ended up ordering the meal from the menu without exchanging the meat. The burger was good. I probably wouldn't return because of the high fee for swapping an item.",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Burger tasted OK. But I paid $3 extra for onion rings instead of fries and got an ants portion of onion rings. I could have literally eaten them all in one bite. My first thought was ""that's it?"" -- not the best first impression.",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Located in Windermere, Burger village is giving us new Burger goals. 

Serving Organic and Exotic Burgers including plant based burgers, Burger Village claim to have Organic, Antibiotic and Hormones free Meat.

We ordered the burgers on their website and they have only pickup option.
Order included Grilled Skinny Chicken Burger and Lamb Burger with Cajun Fries and Coleslaw on sides. Well, their burgers are seriously luscious. We opted for Multigrain buns to make it healthier. Their sauces were on point. Loved the honey mustard and cajun sauce.
They also have their  Loyalty program where you can earn points for every dollar spent and start redeeming once you reach 100 points.

Price - wise, it is bit on higher side. Base price includes only limited toppings.

Value for money - 4/5",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Beef Burger was fresh and meat cooked perfect! 
Needs more flavor & toppings. Ok to use salt, pepper, good oil when cooking healthy! A bit of oil on grill to add flavor to cold bun & grilled onion. My burger needed more lettuce, onion, sauce. The fries and dipping sauce were really good. Few restaurants with good quality food so i will go back. Hope they have spice and oil to ask them to add that and more toppings.",JfGfqCnk0-Tnf6PlahPUJQ
"Not impressed with this location at all.  Ordered a number of dishes with chicken (satay, kids teriyaki) and it was not fully cooked.  We took the chicken up to the counter and, only after persisting, the snarky 'chef' came out saying that the chicken was cooked.  When asked how she knew it was cooked (since it was pink) she simply said, ""The chef knows.  It is dark meat so it is supposed to be pink"".  Won't be returning to this location.",KZ5w1iPH1bSnf-wBEYgtQQ
"The newest addition to the shopping area in Lynnwood, Rice Bowl fills a need for fast, affordable, quality Asian cuisine. The dozens of bowls cover a multitude of Asian styles, and include noodles as well as rice. I tried the pho soup and was surprised by the deep flavour profile of the broth. I also had a green onion cake (you have a choice between the flat cake and the doughnut shape) and it was crispy and full of onions. I also tried some of the lemon chicken - you can get that on rice or as an ""appetizer,"" which is a small bucket full of fried, lemony goodness. It had a good crunch and wasn't too sweet. 

The place is very bright and clean, with cool, colourful decor and lots of long, wooden benches. It took a while for our order to be made, but everything here is made fresh which accounts for the wait. I can imagine it getting very busy here during the lunch hour. 

Food is served in paper bowls and boxes, even if you're staying. My portion did not seem large for the almost $12, but it was deceptive, with lots of meat and noodles that filled me up as much as in the soup restaurants I frequent. 

I am already looking forward to trying other bowls here. The selection is almost overwhelming, and there is a bubble tea and frozen yogurt too.",KZ5w1iPH1bSnf-wBEYgtQQ
"Sunday take out! The Jasper Park Rice bowl delux, is brand new, bright & funky. A welcome addition to Signature Place Plaza. ~ I missed decor photo opts. This made me sad B/c the decor was well thought out, Worth sitting in. 

Fresh and full of flavour. The Korean chicken was marinated, tender & cooked to Perfection. For the $12.99 tag, the chicken & veggies were light but comparable to similar Asian fare on the go. THAI Beef Fried rice was full of flavour and my picky 7 year olds favourite! 

DRB is a welcome change from Subway or McDonalds. I appreciate their menu options are FRESH & made to order 

The menu here is also VAST featuring 8 different regions of Asia. Bubble Tea & Desserts, are available.  The staff members were extremely cheering, and tendered my order swiftly. 

This added to a great impression ~ but they had me when I walked in the door & saw the bright decor :) 

Tip : Catering & Delivery available. Lots of easy parking. The plaza also hosts Second cup, BMO, Pizza 73. Adjacent ~ Bueno Pizza & Grill, Shoes on 149th, Bon Ton Bakery & some other gems. Worth a visit.

GREAT HOURS 11am-10pm !!!",KZ5w1iPH1bSnf-wBEYgtQQ
"We've gotten take out here a couple times. It's conveniently on the way home from work and the wait for take out is only about 10 minutes. There is a really big menu (with pictures) of Asian inspired rice and noodle based dishes (Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc.). The food itself is pretty uninspiring. Some dishes are under flavored (Shanghai noodles, Vietnamese noodle bowl), some are very salty (eg the dried ribs - which are not that dried and pretty fatty). The wonton soup is ok except the meat in the wontons tastes a bit weird and usually has some squeaky bits in it. I'd say the food is 2.5 stars and an extra half star for convenience. If there's a killer dish we haven't encountered it yet.",KZ5w1iPH1bSnf-wBEYgtQQ
"Went for lunch two weeks ago.  Vaccination proofs and IDs were checked - much appreciated.  We had items from the HK weekend menu - Hainan Chicken with rice, beef brisket ramen noodle and stir fried flat noodle with beef. Tasted OK. Portion sizes were fine.",KZ5w1iPH1bSnf-wBEYgtQQ
The pho is always delicious and it's always great on a cold winters day. The new locations offers the same great tastes as expected from the other two restaurants.  Beef satay is my favourite.,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"I do not recommend. Walking in we were not greeted asked only ""how many"". The customer service was horrible. Forgot drink orders. Was mopping the floor 2 hrs prior to close all around all the people that were eating. My opinion  I don't like to eat and smell bleach all around me.  The food was OK but no one came to ask how anything was or follow up. I would not go back",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"After hearing great reviews, we visited this Millwood location Tues Nov 3, 2020 at 5pm.

This restaurant has placed acrylic panels between tables to seat as many people as possible given our new safe distancing rules.

Upon seating, you are given a pot of tea & glasses of water. The tea was so far watered down that it could almost be mistaken for hot water. They need to refresh the tea leaves.

Food came out quickly..grilled beef on vermicelli & assorted meats (grilled chicken, pork, beef) with shrimp on vermicelli. It all looked good but...  The bowls are large, filled with noodles & sprouts, however, skimpy on the chicken & shredded vegetables. Loved the fact that they removed the tail ends of the shrimp.. Most places keep it on. The beef was somewhat dry like it was from the day before...or was that the pork? The flavors of the meats were also lacking to the point that we couldn't tell if it was pork or beef, we could tell with the sparse amount of chicken because it was a different color. The spring roll was very good.

We had ordered a take out for our son but when we got home, it was a pho with tripe (he refused to eat it, no kidding, rt!) and not the grilled chicken & shrimp on vermicelli. Seeing as I don't plan to go there again, we didn't call the restaurant.

Not the friendliest owners/staff. Service was fitting for this restaurant..& I'll leave it at  that. I do want to say the dishes are large (filled with vermicelli & bean sprouts if that's what you like) & very affordable $14-$15.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"This is the new business that took over the corner area of where Tim Hortons used to be in millwoods. The pho here is different than I'm used to since my boyfriend and I frequent pho chain restaurants. The broth here is good, has a little more cilantro than the normal pho broths I get but still appetizing! 

The sizes are a bit smaller than usual as well and the price is about 1-2 dollar difference from the chain pho places I've been to. Understandably though, this is more of a family run restaurant. The service is better than other pho restaurants though as the servers actually check in on you to make sure you're still doing okay which I think is a good plus! 

The menu carries vermicelli bowls, rice platters and pho. I'd love to see banh mi pop up at one of these restaurants ;)

I ordered the small pho with steak and flank but asked for no steak--replacement with extra flank and they were happy to oblige! I was happy to hear since I usually get a dirty look when I ask to substitute meat. 

The boyfriend ordered the grilled pork and shrimp lemongrass vermicelli bowl and loved it! The size was a large portion and he really enjoyed it. 


Overall, this is a place I'll find myself frequenting in the future :)",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"Good food. Good price. Take out are usually placed in a strong sturdy box, unlike other restaurants where they place there food in plastic bags - appreciate that!",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"My go to viet place in town! I'm Vietnamese and this is the best spot for viet food in Edmonton. I only wish I had found it earlier. The place is always packed which is a great sign. Reasonable prices and generous portions. The grilled beef (and grilled pork) salad rolls are to die for. Seriously - try them. Better than my mom's! Hot, quick, delicious food at a decent price. Nice people. Would and have recommended to friends and family. 

The only ""cons"" are the tables are really close together but it doesn't bother me personally.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
Horrible place for take out. I ordered a soup and some spring rolls to go. When I got home my noodles doesn't have meat on it just plane white noodle. So annoying... I would never comeback here. Very poor service.,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"Good pho, but zero dining atmosphere.  Indeed, this used to be a Tim Hortons, and the current owners merely swapped out the tins of coffee in the glass display cases with decorative art. When I visited on a Friday evening, it was totally packed, and we were seated in an awkward table close to the door.  I've never found Tim Hortons to be inviting, and it was loud, crowded and the florescent lights just didn't do it for me. The service was just ok; we made some requests for water that were forgotten, and no one offered to bring us extra cutlery. I've gotten better with chopsticks the past year, but a fork and spoon is nice sometimes.  

The pho was good, not too salty and coming in three different size bowls.  The smallest serving was a perfect size for me, as I generally eat smaller portions, but my friend commented that she was very dissatisfied with the smaller size when she ordered it previously.  My husband didn't like his dish, he found his meat to be too fatty and the broth lacking in flavor. I think that I may order take out from Pho Hoan if I was in the area, but I wouldn't return to dine in.  It felt like a high school cafeteria and it prevented me from really enjoying the meal.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"This is our fav pho place in the south of the city! The service is not the best because every time we come they always forget something. The soup is definitely worth it. It's always busy no matter what time or day. The set up is super tight, you can almost hear that next table to you. We don't mind the tightest as we always come back. Free tea is a plus !!",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"As a disclaimer...earlier this day we were in a major car accident. Our vehicle was totalled and I was taken to the Grey Nun's hospital to be assessed by ambulance. Not exactly the best day. And we live in the North Side. So after a full day with no food, we were waiting to be picked up by a friend to be taken home...and starving. I didn't have my painkiller prescription (concussion, whiplash, bashed knee, and horrible pain in the chest from the seat belt/airbags employed)....so not in the best shape to critique food. (However, you can't fault me for being a dedicated yelper...lol). So I was hungry at 4 PM and the Grey Nuns hot food service was closed until 4:30. Me being a foodie decided to stumble over to Pho Hoan Pasteur which I reasoned (even though I had a concussion) would be a better option then hospital food.  And having no food in the system all day, I was hungry. I wasn't really in a clear mind to assess the place, but to me it seemed to lack atmosphere. Bland colors, no themes, and ugly open kitchen concept, gross hospital style tables and chairs. (Maybe they snagged them from the Grey Nuns). It took our server what felt like a long time to come see us (but having not eaten at all that day, perhaps I was a bit impatient). However, once they took our order, they were pretty prompt in service. *(After being a major accident and spending all day in emerg...I thought we didn't look that bad....not too sure on why they didn't serve us right away). Perhaps because we were still in shock, we ordered our comfort food - salad rolls with shrimp, my hubby orderd the Bun Bo Cha Gio - Grilled beef and spring rolls with vermicelli, and I ordered the wonton soup. Everything was decent but not outstanding. The salad rolls were the most disappointing. I realized that my head couldn't have been hit that hard when I realized that they lacked the flavour in them. Stuffed with lettuce (?) instead of the either mint/cilantro/basil combo I am use to. Will never order these again. They really need to step up their game with these. The mains were decent but nothing remarkable. I enjoyed my soup. I found the soup base to be bland, however with all the soya sauce/oyster sauce/chili oil/ chili paste on the table, it isn't hard to doctor it up to the flavour you like. The wontons were pleasant enough and stuffed with pork filling...and a decent amount of veggies. My husband ate his vermicelli bowl without too much of comment...it looked fine and fresh. I tried his spring roll and it tasted fine but was a little skimpy on the filling.  Oddly, what I did enjoy immensely was the free tea. I couldn't place the flavour but it wasn't the typical watered down green tea that you get in a lot of places. It was delicious and warm and comforting. Would I choose to eat here again? No. Is it better bang for your buck compared to the hospital cafeteria food? Probably (I can't say for sure because I haven't eaten there but the fact that they don't have hot food to order all day says something about the place). And it was really quick. So if you are at the Nuns for an appointment, or want to give some joy to a patient there, give this place a try.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"For informal Vietnamese, you can't beat Pho Hoan Pasteur! I have to admit, I've only eaten the vermicelli here, but I've had it several times and it's the best I've eaten. Same with the bubble tea. Top notch!
Staff are friendly and table service is quick.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"This was my first time at this particular Vietnamese restaurant, and I was very impressed! First of all, this one was much bigger than most Pho restaurants, they usually only have 5-6 tables, this one was easily double that. We were seated right away and were brought water and tea as soon as we sat down. They have a nice and big menu with lots of variety for soup/ noodle bowls. There were 3 sizes for the soups, regular, large, and extra large, and were $13-16 each. We were ambitious and ordered the extra large pho soups, and holy man they were huge! So it's definitely worth it if you've got a big appetite to go with the bigger bowl. The staff were friendly, and the restaurant wasn't super loud. We were really happy here and will probably be back soon!",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"Little known fact: Edmonton has some of the best Vietnamese noodle places in the country.  Pho Hoan Pasteur is has been around for a long time, and in my opinion, they have the best Pho Sate of any other place in this city.  If you love satay beef noodle soup, don't miss this spot.  Wonderfully rich, flavourful broth, with tender slices of rare beef.  Original location is located in Kingsway area (just north of downtown), but they've since opened up 2 other locations...Millwoods and West End.  We've been to them all, and I have to say for the satay, the Kingsway and Millwoods locations are best. 

Their vermicelli bowls are pretty good too, as are their rice dishes.

Service at the Millwoods location is unusually good for a pho spot too!

For those who want a basic beef pho, nothing compares to Pho Tau Bay in Chinatown.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"We needed a last minute supper since we were running late on our plans. We chose this place because it was fairly close to home, had great reviews and wasn't a burger joint. On a Sunday evening about an hour before closing, this place was still busy! Parking is not an issue here, and we were seated almost immediately. It is a little cramped for seating and a little lacking in ambience, but only because it used to be a Tim Horton's location. 
They do have high chairs, boosters and change tables here too. It's an excellent place for a family with small children because they provide you with small bowls and teaspoons that are perfectly sized for small hands, plus they give you a pair of scissors to cut up your kids food. 
Service is friendly, fast, and efficient. They are constantly cleaning which I appreciate. My youngest was throwing a hunger tantrum before we even ordered & staff was nice enough to bring out a jar of lollipops for her to pick one to tide her over. There wasn't any pressure to hurry either.
From order to table, it took less than 10 minutes. Portion size is pretty good. We ordered 2 large phos and 1 vermicelli dish. It easily stuffed our family of 2 plus 2 littles and even had enough leftover for a small lunch. I like the broth here and I'm a cilantro hater, but I didn't even taste it (if there was any in there). The tea tastes different here too, in a pleasant way. 
For a local family business, I think they've nailed it. I'll definitely be back here when I'm wanting some authentic Vietnamese food close to home.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"Had #42. Very good. I like being able to add all the sauces to tweak the flavour and add heat. 

We also had spring rolls and salad rolls. Both yum. 

Fast service even though restaurant was full. 

Would come again.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
A much better use of an ex Tim Hortons location! I understand why this cafe is so busy. The phone soups are delicious. Satay noodle soup is a solid 8 out of 10. Friendly courteous service. Affordable. Excellent choice for Vietnamese in South Edmonton. Love how they Reno's a Tim's to a higher purpose.,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
The restaurant is simple uncomfortable. The most noticeable element was the added seating in what used to clearly be an entryway. I would say this place is fine for lunch but I wouldn't take someone here for any kind of occasion. The food is similar to other locations (although not as good as Kingsway) but the set up is just jarring. I'm surprised people haven't started calling this location Pho Hortons Pasteur.,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"Visited this restaurant on the weekend with family members from Europe.  I had high hopes based on the reviews.  However, we were disappointed as it was not what we had expected in terms of quality, flavour and value for money for 'traditional' Vietnamese.

I think that coming from Europe we have strong palates for more traditional cooking.

As for the service - then need to work on customer relations and welcoming those of us that are new to their restaurant.

Overall very disappointing",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"I do not get the hype about this place at all. The portions are so small, the quality isn't great, and the service is non-existent. When I ordered a pho, the amount of bean sprouts they gave us on the side was laughable. And lemons instead of limes... come on, spend a bit more money for likes. The salad rolls also didn't have anything great to them either. Lots of other good places asides this one.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"Been here a few times, pho is pretty good. But the customer service aint that great. There is this old lady that wears glasses that would look at us weird, and she always seems so mad. idk. some other staff are nice but eh. everyone has their own opinion",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ

Service was great plus the ambience.. we love the food and me personally i love the shrimp tempura!",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"I went here just a couple months back and needed to review it. I've lived in this area for the majority of my life and coming from a Vietnamese background, never found a good place to have Pho in the Southside when my mom didn't want to make any. Lo and behold, this old Timmy's turns into a Pho place. I found it funny that you can still tell it used to be a Timmy's haha! Both my brothers and my dad approved and my partner and I decided to come here with my Dad to try it out. Mind you I only visited here once and had their Bon Bo Hue whereas my Dad and partner both had Pho. They liked theirs, and upon taste test - it's good! It's not the best but I like to think I'm really strict about what I like about Pho. Now as for my BBH, I'm also just as strict. Lots of places like to either over-spice, over-salt, or make BBH as bland as possible. The BBH I had here that time was just right. It's not perfect but it's tasty enough for the person who wants and can handle a little bit more heat. It wasn't over-salted or over-spiced. I could be giving this place an extra star JUST because it's finally a place I can depend on to get some soup in the Southside :-)

As a side note to other reviewers, I don't mind when I'm not greeted in Vietnamese/Asian establishments as ""how many??"" because, well, that's how Asians are sometimes and I've been used to it since I was a child. I did not, however, like that the staff was also mopping around while we were eating here in the middle of the afternoon. Yay for cleanliness, but come on, choose a better time.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
This is the first time i try salad rolls.. They should go back to Vietnam learn how's to make salad rolls.or watch on YouTube they will teach u guy the right way.,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ

"We used to drive to the Northside location before we discovered one close by - it was that good. This location is less good. Very clean environment, good Vietnamese fare but the service could use some help. When putting in an order for pickup I tried to give her my husbands name so he could pick it up. Was told 'no just tell us what you ordered when you pickup'. So he did and what do you know, someone else had already picked up that order. They asked to speak to me to verify what I ordered and rattled off something very different from what I ordered. I repeated what I ordered and she tried to tell me that was NOT what I told her earlier. I asked why they don't just take names she told me their way was much better and could my husband wait another 10 minutes so they could remake the order? 
So more than average patience is required!",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"I love their beef noodle soup, tasty broth with enough meat and noodles to fill me up the whole day! Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere!",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"This location use to be Tim Hortons!

We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was very busy inside! We were seated quickly and water was brought to our table. Food was ordered and brought out in a timely manner. Their bun bo hue was a little odd, like they just added chili to their pho. The pho tasted alright.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
Really really good.  I had the vegetarian spring rolls and chicken pho. The broth was incredible. Awesome fast and friendly service! Highly recommend!,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
I've been to this place many times and this time I wanted just a little something crispy so I got their spring rolls- always crispy and delicious with their savoury dipping sauce. Can't go wrong here!,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
It's as good as it gets. I'm a pain to make soup for and they get it right every time. It is always full for a reason.,O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"We decided to try this place out since it was a new Pho place close to our house.  Probably not going back.

Food was ok...if you don't mind the noodles being a little over. Soup was not very hot and felt the prices were high considering how much food we got. My daughter ended up with a piece of bone in her spring roll.

Service was pretty dismal. We were standing at the door for a good 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  It took even longer for someone to come by and take our order. They couldn't even get the order right. The bean sprouts, mint, and lemons we had to ask for and trying to get their attention was pretty painful. It took another table across from us to get the server's attention to get these and forks for my kids.

I have never not tipped (usually no less than 10%), but these guys really made me consider not tipping at all...2 stars because the food was passable.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
"I absolutely love the food here! I work super close and order from them probably once or twice a week for pick up. The size is good and the Pho is always super hot.

My only complaint is that the service when dinning in isn't always the greatest. Once you have your food they don't normally come around to check if you would like anything else or refills.",O9W0Qs32RL5kU2_9oqZCKQ
Ordered the dinner for three from here based on recommendations. It was super affordable and came really quickly.  My only complaint would be that the meat portion in the ginger beef and beef n greens was small. It was more veggies than meat. Everything else tasted awesome and huge portion sizes.,PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
"I'll say this, they deliver quick. I read a lot of bad reviews on this place but their prices are cheap enough to justify the low quality. I know it ain't 'Cactus Club' type of food, but it ain't Cactus prices either. You get what you pay for and it's worth it.",PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
"Ordered a couple dishes from them because they where the cheapest and was expecting some bad Chinese food that would just barly hit the spot, instead I got large portions and great tasting food only complaint would be the dumplings where still a little doughy and could have used a little longer cooking but they still tasted great, the curry beef is exceptional (THEY PUT POTATO IN IT!!) and then you can throw some of that on the rice mhmm exited for the next time I'll be able to order from them but for now I've got leftovers for days !",PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
"Ordered delivery via Skip the Dishes based on online reviews. I have to admit I had extremely low expectations, but it's pretty good! I thought the combo C was supposed to include fried rice and not chow mein, but it was tasty and I don't want to complain. The dumplings were probably the highlight, along with the beef and veggies. All in all I think it was good value and tasted good.",PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
"NEVER EVER EAT HERE
... unless you like wasting your time and money. I ordered $40 worth of food and it was all crap. 
I'm a vegetarian and clearly they don't understand when you order ""no meat. egg is okay"" . meat all throughout my meal and the ""vegetable spring rolls"" have meat in them.
my boyfriend who is not vegetarian said all of his food was gross and soggy the only thing that was ok was chicken fried rice. 
we ordered the wonton soup, dinner for one, Singapore noodles and vege fried rice. all of which sucked. 
when I called to complain the guy sounded confused like he didn't know what to do . or what specifically was wrong. I believe I was pretty clear but apparently he couldn't comprehend the things I was saying. eventually I just gave up trying to get new food and asked for a refund.  
they then came back to my apartment to retrieve the old food (like they're going to sell it again) and give me my money back (cash when I paid with Mastercard ?? )
I will never ever order from here again.",PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
"They sold me uncooked rotten food!
Save yourself the food poisoning and don't go there.",PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
"I've ordered delivery with Dover Kam through skip the dishes a few times now, and it's been great every time! It's very inexpensive, too.",PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
Very very disappointed small hamburger size containers for full price tiny amounts of meat biggest ripoff in the Chinese food business . They should at least let you know the size of container they are offering . Just a big rip off and the food isn't very good at all . Pull up your socks and get your act together Dover Kam and serve your customers better and bigger servings !,PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
"We ordered take out. The Dinners for 3 people was plentiful and they arrived on time. Price was right. Some of the dishes were ok, but I did like the chow mein and the chicken dishes.",PJeoajci4MBVuyAOQet57g
Our favourite Vietnamese place was closed for the owners holiday so we tried this place. Place is clean and nicely renovated service was decent but I was very Disappointed with the food vermicelli bowl very tiny amount of grilled pork one skinny spring roll. Tried the pho as well and wasnt impressed Best comparison would the Vietnamese you get in a mall food court. Don't think I will be back,PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"I was impressed with this little neighbourhood restaurant. The place boasts a fairly large, well decorated dining area which was three quarters full on a Tuesday night. With all of the Vietnamese options available in Edmonton, this level of patronage is a great sign. 

Following someone's recommendation, I had the P6 which is pho with brisket, rare beef, tripe and tendon. That's my kind of noodle soup! When it arrived, I could smell its fragrant aroma even before it touched the table. The condiments were plenteous. The regular bowl I ordered was a great size for a great price. I was ready for a feast!

The first few bites matched my expectation. The flavours were rich. I thought perhaps I had found a new favourite location for pho. As I continued, however, I found the flavours flattened and the broth just couldn't live up to what I had elsewhere. 

Their pho is better than so many other locations I've tried, although not my favourite, so I certainly recommend checking it out. It may match your personal preference perfectly. You'll never know till you check it out.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"The food is quiet good. We had the spicy noodle soup, shrimp cake, beef shake salad, and deep fried squid. We even ordered second plate of beef shake salad. The shrimp cake is made in house and very delicious.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"If you follow any of my reviews, you know pho is my favourite food and I eat a lot it lol.  Imagine my delight to see this restaurant opening up literally at the end of my block! 

We noticed they finally were open and popped in for lunch. 
It was busy and the servers were new, but very friendly and very attentive! 

I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee which is premade for you. Maybe a little too sweet doe my liking, but it can always be touch and go. 
We ordered the shrimp cakes and spring rolls to start. 

The spring rolls were very large! Great potion size doe the price! 
I'd never had shrimp cakes before. I was thinking they might be crispy but they weren't - more of an omelette texture. My husband didn't like it but I thought it was tasty and an interesting texture. 

For the main course, I ordered the P6 Pho. Tripe, tendon, rare beef in a flavourful broth. 
It was delicious! The large is a little smaller than other places, but the price was right! 
I prefer my broth spicy and the server was happy to bring me out a little jar of chili oil. 

My husband ordered the beef on rice and he said was absolutely delicious and seemed to be a good sized portion. 

I will be back. A lot!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Mini Special Appetizer and Rare Beef, Brisket, Tendon & Tripe Noodle Soup

Thien An is a fairly new pho place in the Capilano area. Wasn't too hungry but had to try this mini special appetizer that had one of everything on the appetizer list. It had a spring roll, salad roll, shrimp cake, and a torpedo shrimp. Surprisingly decent spring roll, and even tastier torpedo shrimp because it had cream cheese i think between the shrimp and wrapper. The pho wasn't bad, not great, but it was standard pho. Big bowl at a standard price. They also serve banh mi's here which is a rarity for most pho place, but it's nice that they offer.

Located on 101 ave and 73st, it's a nice clean restaurant with quick service. Try all the appetizers if you're in the area and maybe a banh mi for takeout. 
Sal says: Just Try It

Erik says: I probably wouldn't go there unless I lived in the area.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"It's good! We were hyped up when a new pho place opened in our neighborhood. One step inside and we knew we were in good hands. Clean, quiet, and crisp. Delicious salad rolls, and onion cakes to die for. Yummy dishes; we shared vermicelli and rice dishes with the girls and everyone loved them. Very tasty sauces and a good mix of vegetables and meat. We'll be back soon!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"This is our go to vietnamese restaurant for lunch (from work)... so needless to say, my coworkers and I go there often. 

This place has always had super friendly and accommodating service when we have gone in. Their prices are pretty average but the quality of food is better than a lot of other places in the area or even in the city. 

They have a fairly typical menu with all the normal tasty vietnamese dishes (soups rice noodle bowls, stirfries, grilled meat salads, salad rolls, etc) and a decently large vegetarian selection. I would definitely recommend the sate peanut soup - delicious with a little bit of spicy. So perfect for a cold day or if maybe you have had a bit too much to drink the night before. 

I wish this place was actually closer to my home cause I would probably make it one of my go to Vietnamese places but I will settle for it being a nice treat on a work day.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Decided to try a new place and ended up finding this hidden gem! We had the combo platter to start and then I had the curry chicken as my main.. now I wasn't expecting it to be a soup but it was sure amazing! And my rice came out in a heart shape too, so cute! 
I ended up cutting my meal short as I saw the deep fried ice cream on the dessert menu and could not pass it up and I man I was not disappointed. Everything was very good and the staff was super friendly. I will be back for sure",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"I was in the Forest Heights area on business and stopped in here for lunch. The place is large and beautiful, and the staff wonderful. The menu has an extensive selection of Vietnamese and other Asian dishes like soup, noodle bowls, stir fry, and a selection of vegetarian items. I went with the tofu pad thai. The portion was huge, it was flavourful without being too spicy, and there was a lot of tofu. I also ordered two veggie spring rolls on the side, which were crispy and fresh. My friend was not happy with his peach shrimp - he said they were fried shrimp covered in mayonnaise, with canned peaches on the side. He also did not like or finish his chicken stir fry, as the chicken had an odd texture - kind of soft and rubbery. I would come here again to try something Vietnamese like pho or a vermicelli bowl, but perhaps stay away from anything with chicken in it.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"New restaurant..beautiful and modern inside. Very courteous, friendly service. We were seated quickly and our food came right away. Customer service was first rate.

Food is EXCELLENT and great prices! For appys we got spring rolls, torpedo shrimp, fried squid (calamari)..For mains we ordered the beef stir fry with crispy noodles (my fav!), seafood pad Thai, BBQ short ribs and fried rice.   

You cannot go wrong with your order, everything is delicious!!

It was a full house when we were there at 5:30pm on a Sunday. I'd recommend making a reservation for weekend nights (Fri/Sat).",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Delicious food! Excellent service, modest prices, speedy meal preparation. We visited on one of the coldest evenings of the recent cold snap and the 'vibe' of customers enjoying a meal was warm and wonderful. A 'must go back to' place.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Thien An is a new Vietnamese restaurant to open us in this neck of the woods. Not much is in this area except we did pass Pho & Bun a few blocks west on the way back home. 

There's plenty of room to park and they even have a lot in the back. We came on a late Monday afternoon so there were only a few tables occupied. The inside is new and quite spacious. 

The menu is massive but the southern Vietnamese soup (hu tiu mi) and beef stew (bo kho) caught my eye. 

- Fresh salad roll with tofu (V2) ($6.00 for four) - these were nicely done. Slightly warmed, freshly made and with a good peanut dipping sauce. 
- Veggie noodle soup (V9) ($10.50) - O's converted to partial vegetarianism so it was veggie soup for her. She liked the broth and it looked like a satisfactory amount of tofu, vegetables and noodles. 
- Hu tieu nam vang (H2) ($13.00) - smelled great. You choose either egg noodles or rice noodles. I asked about it and you actually can get a mix, so I tried both. You get a variety of meat (beef, shrimp, squid and ground pork) but a bit more meat and noodles would justify the higher price point. That being said, the broth was solid and had a sweetness to it similar to what you find in a wonton/egg noodle soup.

What I found interesting was the shape of their bowls. The top part of the bowl forms into a square shape. Odd. 

Good first experience. I'd come back to try their bo koh and other pho options. 3.5 stars.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
So glad you are located in my neighborhood. We enjoy so many of your dishes and like to try something new or different on occasion. If I stop in for lunch by myself I am memorized and entertained by the huge fish tank. Nice place to take a group.,PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Good service. Very clean. The beef sate soup is nutty with the perfect amount oF spice. 
Great family run place.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
Fantastic experience here. The curry is spot on. They're smart in offering appetizers in combos. Great atmosphere and a modest price.,PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"We went on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was empty which threw me of a bit. The restaurant was super clean and it was nicely decorated. We ordered the rare beef and beef ball pho, the well done beef and beef ball soup and we had deep fried squid to start. The soup broth was good, not the best I've tasted but not the worst. The squid was quite good, the flavour was great! The only thing I would have like is if it where deep fried a bit longer. The main reason I am giving a 4 star is that the restaurant is very very clean and the decor is much nicer than other Vietnamese food places. I will be back to try their vermicelli bowls that look great!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"I live close by to this restaurant and I have been meaning to try it for a long time. I ordered takeout for my husband and I and the person that I talked to on the phone was so friendly! They said it would be ready in ten minutes which is really quick. My husband went to pick it up and the first thing he said to me when he got home was wow the people who work there are so nice! He also said the restaurant was updated and nice on the inside. We both ordered vermicelli bowls and they wear so fresh and delicious. I got grilled beef on mine and it was cooked perfect. I normally find some meat on vermicelli bowls at other restaurants too tough or stringy that I can't eat all of it, but this beef was so delicious I couldn't get enough! My husband got the pork and shrimp and he loved it! We will definitely be ordering from here again!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"New Vietnamese restaurant has opened up near my place so decided to check it out on a Saturday night. 
I ordered the Thien An Noodle Soup special.
Very flavourful and generous portion given. 
My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Curry and it was splendid as well. 

Nothing but good things to say about this place. Taste much better than Pho Boy (another place that just open up).",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"The fresh spring roll with grilled pork was delicious. I really liked that the peanut dipping sauce that came with it was served warm.  So good.  

For mains, I tried the house special pho and vermicelli bowl.  Both were quite good, especially the grilled meat in the vermicelli bowl. However, I found some slices of beef in the pho to be a tad tough.  The avocado shake is pretty decent as well.  Restaurant looks super clean and service was excellent.  I'll be back!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"The decor is very nice, I particularly like the square pane door and the checkerboard ceiling. There is lots of parking out front and a fence to lock your bikes to in front of the windows. 
My server was quick and friendly and my food came out in under five minutes; if you're on a short lunch this would be a great spot to stop.
I had the grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli. I was a little put off because the noodles they use are more like spaghetti then vermicelli but the flavour was wonderful so I can overlook it. The pork was grilled perfectly, the spring roll was delicious,and the portion was huge. I'll definitely be back.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Brought hubs here for an early Father's Day lunch after reading fabulous reviews.  

Loved the vibe and layout from the moment we entered.  The playful black and white checkered ceiling tiles kept me smiling throughout the meal.  

The staff were friendly and attentive.  I liked that the water automatically had lemon in it (hubs did not, oops).

We opted to try the grilled lemongrass beef salad rolls to start - yum!

I ordered the combo Bun Vermicelli bowl since I'm a vermicelli girl by nature.  I really liked the fried onions sprinkles on top.  Unfortunately I did not like the shrimp/fish cake.  I'm a DIE HARD Golden Bird Vermicelli girl so it's hard to improve upon that.

Hubs tried the Vietnamese Style Soup.  The flavour was great - but admittedly we were a bit squeamish with the fat/tendons. 

Both of us thought the mains were lacking in meat considering the prices.

I ordered a Vietnamese Iced Coffee to go that was perfect!

All in all, really liked Thien An and will definitely be back and next time I'll ask the server for recommendations of what they're favourite dishes are.

Clean, bright, and playful atmosphere - perfect for a Vietnamese Newbie that might be a bit shy in China Town. 

See you soon Thien An, see you soon!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
So very good. Sister was recommended by some family members that run a nail salon and is very good. I love to support small business and love the selection of food they have. The quality of the food is also marginally better then most other Vietnamese food places which is super appreciated. It's also very authentic and have food from different parts,PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Decided to finally check out Thien An tonight after driving past about a hundred times. Happy to report that it did live up to the hype. A modern and sleep interior with fancy lighting, checker board ceiling and plants galore. It was roomy and even the chairs were fancy leather seating but the do offer booster seats for those dining with kids. They also have two large TVs, one at each end of the room, so you can watch the Oilers at the same time!
My group ordered the appetizer combo which came with spring rolls, shrimp rolls, shrimp cake and veg rolls. I'm not usually into veg rolls but these tasted great with the satay dip on the side. 
We shared pork fried rice, ginger beef and combination Pad Thai. They were all tasty but the pork fried rice was extremely good. Friendly service, great food, loads of left overs and free parking. Oh yeah!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"We were seated quickly on a busy Friday evening in this quaint restaurant that is conveniently located just off 101 Ave. The interior is clean and modern and the staff were quick to offer us water and tea for no charge. 

The beef pho has a very flavourful broth with a good portion of both beef and noodles. It came with a large side plate of bean sprouts and Thai basil to add as you wish. It was very tasty and still a fairly light soup. The pork and shrimp cake was also a large portion that was a balanced combination of fresh vegetables, rice noodles and fried meats.",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"This was seriously a great surprise! Passed by many times but never went in. 
Inside is clean and well decorated. Washrooms are big bright and very clean. Best Pho' ever in my opinion. Chose Veggie and will come back soon for another yummy bowl. Flavor was perfect!",PjWv-WZKYtkKbqOG0y83ZQ
"Came here a few times with a buddy of mine after a work out at the gym not far from it and every single time we came, we were greeted with a friendly server in a small, but very clean, place. 
We always get the Vietnamese noodles (should've tried other dishes) and boy were they good! I mean, about $11 for a HUGE bowl of noodles? How could I ignore that?

Spring rolls and onion cake came out hot and tasted amazing, and the kimchi they got gives you a fresh refreshing spring feeling.

We received the main dish in a short and reasonable amount of time as well as condiments such as lime, sprouts, mint leaves with stem, and whole chili peppers. 

The meat that came with the meal was so juicy and tender, the soup was full of flavor.

I could not ask for a better quality this place has shown to me.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"Well what an awesome restaurant across from London Drugs in T&T Market plaza.  I ordered the #27 Bun Bo Hue.  

Kim works the front and her business partner Thu is the chef.  Kim is very friendly and recommended it to me.  The broth is everything in a good bowl of Vietnamese soup and it didn't disappoint.  It was delicious.  

The ingredients were fresh and I could watch Thu make the soup.  I couldn't believe all the steps in a bowl of soup, but she was busy.

I had a Vietnamese iced coffee and it was great.  My bill was $15.17.

They will definitely be welcomed in the neighbourhood.

The restaurant, is new, clean, bright and nice.

I would highly recommend this restaurant.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"Basic review for a pretty good place. 

Green onion cakes are amazing. Not greasy.

Ordered the chicken vermicelli and 5 colors vermicelli. Pretty great actually. Meats were cooked very well, good flavor. Spring rolls are crunchy without being super greasy. Fresh veggies, good sweet sauce for the noodles.

Lost a star only because the washrooms didn't have any paper towels after washing my hands. Hand sanitizer was also not readily available. No big deal.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"I've made this place my treat of the week. Clean restaurant, consistently made food, and friendly staff. Northside gem",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"I was lucky enough to just happen across this place while doing some shopping at London Drugs. Its fairly new I learned from the lady at the counter. It's not much to look at inside or out, the term 'kitchen express' in the title almost out me off, assuming it would be some greasy mall version of Vietnamese. I did venture in, its a small place with around 10 tables and is definitely reminiscent of a cafeteria. But when I'm looking for pho, dining ambience is of little or no consequence to me. It was clean, that's all I need. 
Now to the phone, which was spectacular. Like I said, I was certainly wary of what I was getting into but once the big steamy bowl of pho came out my mind was at ease. The broth and meat, the key phone ingredients, were both excellent. Good quality meat and a fragrant, flavorful broth, not too oily or salty. The pho had both green onion and red onion and the nice addition of cilantro. Served with the usual suspects, basil, lime and sprouts. 
Around $10 for the bowl. There was quite a bit of foot traffic for takeout coming in and out so I'll take that as a good sign. 
I'll definitely be back!",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"I came here the other weekend and ordered the chicken pho and the chicken vermicelli bowl. This order was for take out - the place has about 7 tables and it was pretty busy when I got in there, my order took about 20 minutes which is average . 

Once I got home I dug in, honestly I wish the broth for the pho had more flavour, I felt like I had to add more than usual. Also the noodles I wasn't a fan of. The chicken was cooked fine and I liked the bag of add ons. 

For the vermicelli, the chicken was amazing, veggies fresh and the noodles were great. The fish sauce was perfect, I would order this one again.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"Hands down the best ph√µ place in YEG. I do not say this lightly as I have a sample size of 10+ to compare with. The thing that stands out the most for me about Nam Kitchen is the quality and freshness of everything they serve. You will never see a wilted basil leaf here. Good service too, which is generally rare to find with Asian restaurants.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"Just updating my review to 5 stars. Why 5 stars you ask? Consistency. I have now been here more than 10 times, I have the same thing every time and it is always awesome. Some pho in this city is hit and miss, crummy meat one day, salty broth the next. Nam's is always the same and always excellent. My new fave.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"I love vermicelli bowls, and we were craving them this weekend. So we ordered here from SkipTheDishes. We ordered the BBQ chicken bowl, bbq pork bowl and bbq beef bowl. We split them so everyone could have some of each meat. All three were really great. Each serving is pretty big, you could almost split one order for two people. There was enough leftover for me to take a big portion for lunch the next day. 

My only complaint were the spring rolls, which come with each bowl. They were very hard and dry, not sure what happened to them. But otherwise everything was good.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"I'm not a fan at all. Not one little bit. What a waste of 40$. Not going here again. The food was cold, flavourless. The salad rolls were just textured warm and yucky. The greatest thing we got was our Coca Cola.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"This isn't the best Vietnamese you can get but it was pretty good for being an impulse stop. The prices have changed so things seem a bit expensive to me but maybe I'm just out of touch. the vermicelli bowl I got was packed with everything I like, I did have to ask for a little extra fish sauce because the size they give you to begin is small so if you're getting take away keep this in mind. The service was spectacular, the food came quick, and they nicely packed everything that i didn't finish. It seems a little rundown inside, I would say in need of a few renovations. They have crossed things out on the menus, the linoleum on the tables was peeling, my table and chair were so wobbly it was hard to sit comfortable, and the bathroom fixtures had seen better days. If you want some good food quickly I would recommend this place but if you're on the hunt for the best affordable Vietnamese I would look somewhere else.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"Found myself near Northgate around lunch time today and spotted Nam express from the parking lot. I believe the only other food outlet in that strip was Edo so we decided to try this instead and hopefully get something more unique. The space was bigger than I expected and they have seating for a couple dozen people (7-8 tables). The server was super nice and acknowledged us as soon as we walked in even though the place was fairly busy.
There is a lot on the menu but it is mostly types of pho, vermicelli bowls, stir frys, salad rolls and a few other items. We tried the kung pao chicken with rice, the dry pork ribs and the chicken pho. All the items were delicious and the portions were generous, we had to pack it for home.
The prices as reasonable for the pho, I found the ribs and kung pao to be a little expensive compared to other places but the portions arebalso bigger, so it is fair.
I am not sure when I will be in Northgate again, but this place is a good bet for a filling meal.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"One could easily miss seeing nam kitchen express tucked away in the strip malls beside T&T at north gate center. It's a small restaurant with limited seating, but packs big Vietnamese flavor! From the pho to vermicelli bowls to the fried noodles, nam kitchen express has tasty authentic Vietnamese dishes for a great price. Servings are very generous, I ordered the special noodle bowl for takeout and I could hardly finished have the bowl. The green onion cakes are also a nice treat, light and crispy. It's defiantly not a place to eat if you're looking for an ambient atmosphere or stellar service, but you can't go wrong if you're looking for some genuine Vietnamese food.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"I came to this place as I am a lover of pho and it's close to my work. Ordered the Shrimp Salad rolls. Asked for a half order which they offer, however he bought me a full order and when I pointed it out he said ""too late now I can pack it to go for you""! I should have to pay for something I didn't order. I was not a fan of these rolls, they weren't put together well and fell apart once picked up. The peanut sauce that accompanies them I bought seems think rather thick and tasted more like peanut butter, again not a fan. 

I also order the Beef Satay Pho, I was a little disappointed  with this also!  The soup was almost sweet, I think that was due to there being cucumbers and tomatoes in it. First time I've had this in my Satay. Again not a fan, next time I'll try the beef Pho and if that's no good I won't be returning.",QMaXUlBsA0SLiYZOzDAjVQ
"Serious quality and decent prices!

I picked up some jalape√±o pepperoni here to bring home while dining in the attached Uncle Ed's.

Staff were friendly and attentive.

Shop had unusual candies and some traditional treats.

You can also purchase the perogies and sausages here that they serve at Uncle Ed's.

If you order Mundare Sausage house fundraiser items from kids in your neighbourhood or coworkers - this is where you can buy the goods any time :-)

I will definitely be back!",QehLpDI-ZdJJLu5dobDdxg
"I am so lucky to have this deli nearby. An extensive selection of sausage and pepperoni, it's hard to choose!! They do offer samples to help make the decision and the staff know their stuff. The refrigerators at the back are stuffed with perogies of all varieties, cabbage rolls, and more, more, more. There are so many jams, relishes and knick knacks filling the shelves too. There is always someone nearby to ask for advise on items or cooking tips. 

At the counter they have flyers with some cooking instructions so you can make the perfect perogy in your own house. I bought the cheddar and potato version, which are now a staple in our house, as my daughter is obsessed with these delicious dumplings. I also bought the bratwurst and spicy Italian sausage - both are high quality products that are a must try. 
If you would rather just eat out, the restaurant is connected to the deli. A great way to try before you buy. 

The website also has videos with cooking demos - they really make it so easy for you to cook an authentic Ukrainian dish at home.",QehLpDI-ZdJJLu5dobDdxg
"We stopped here last week because I've been in the mood for sauerkraut perogies. So we bought those, along with blueberry perogies, and sweet cabbage rolls.
We had the blueberry perogies last week, and just had the sauerkraut perogies and sweet cabbage rolls this evening. I haven't tasted cabbage rolls that good since we lived next door to an elderly Ukrainian lady 10 years ago. She used to bring us a home-made Ukrainian dish every Friday night.
You can cut the cabbage rolls in half on your plate, and not get stringy pieces lingering all over the place. The rice isn't your typical ""minute"" rice, though I'm not sure what type it is. And the cabbage rolls taste almost ""creamy"".
The sauerkraut perogies were decadent! Just enough sauerkraut in them so you can taste it, without it being overwhelming.
And the blueberry perogies that we had last week were the best I've ever tasted. But be careful cutting into them with your fork, as the blueberry sauce tends to squirt a bit, since there's so much filling.
Oh, the service? It was quite good, after about a 5 minute wait. The lady was helpful and friendly, even though it was busy.
We will definitely return, probably later this week.",QehLpDI-ZdJJLu5dobDdxg
"Yum! The sausage here is as good as I remember. I haven't had one in forever and it's way cheaper then buying them vacuum packed at the store. I got two MASSIVE rings for $11. How can you say no? I will have to come back sometime to sit down and eat because it smelled wonderful in there. There was also so much other stuff to order the deli counter was huge! Bratwurst and Italian sausage are on my ""to order"" next time I go !",QehLpDI-ZdJJLu5dobDdxg
"This is a review of the side where your purchase food. 

The short story: The customer service is horrible. I've ate there before, and the girls are so unprofessional, but I've never bought food from there. Let's just say they treated me more like a nuisance than a customer, and they purposely tried to make me feel bad for doing nothing wrong.

The long story: I can honestly say I've never felt less important in my life at a store.

The line up was a little weird, so I let the two people who seemed to be in front of me go ahead. Maybe that's my problem - I'm too courteous for the Mundare Sausage House?

As they were ordering, about 10 other people walked in, so I just stood behind the two ordering and waited for them to get done, thinking I would be next in line. That's how line-ups work, right?

The girls behind the counter had to have seen me there. I'm not that tiny, trust me. They never told me to move to a different spot. So, I stood there waiting for the people in front of me to get done. 

One of the women who had come into the store started to side step her way in front of me while some people lined up behind me and others kind of stood by the counter. It was very disorganized, but I was next in line because before they all came in, it was me and the two people ordering. 

When the woman in front of me was finally done, I started to take a step forward so that I could buy my stuff, when one of the girls behind the counter said, ""Can I help who's next?"" and the sidestepping woman raised her hand. Keep in mind she was right beside me now. 

I gave the girls a look to say that I was next, but then the very loud woman behind the deli informed me that the line starts on the other side of the deli, not where I was standing. I told her I wasn't ordering anything from the deli, and she just shrugged and continued to help the woman who had worked her way beside me AND who had NOT been on the other side of the deli - SHE HAD BEEN RIGHT BESIDE ME. So why was she getting served if that was the logic? And how the heck would the people get served who had lined up behind me? 

It was apparent that my order was not as important as hers. Or, maybe I wasn't as important as her?

The man who had been helped before me had just finished his huge order, and he stood there staring at me like I was an idiot. The other woman behind the counter just stood there looking at the till. I have never been made to feel so small in my life. I didn't do anything wrong, but they made me feel like I was a pain in their ass. 

I told her that if they didn't want me to order from there, I wouldn't. She didn't say anything, so I put my stuff away and walked out. They all could have cared less. 

I'm only willing to give my business where it is appreciated, and I can honestly say that I will NEVER be back to this place. I have had a lot of bad service in my life, but I've never had someone yell at me from behind a counter loud enough for everyone to hear and cause everyone to stare at me as I waited for someone to throw me a bone and help me out here. 

The women behind the counter knew I was next... it was obvious. But, instead of taking my simple order of 3 things, they yelled at me in front of all the customers about where I was supposed to line up and then ignored me so that I looked and felt completely awkward. 

Poor customer service at the till shows poor customer service behind the till. I've worked at enough restaurants and stores to know that when people are rude and careless up front, they are extra rude and careless in the back. Who knows what's going on behind the scenes here. I wouldn't want to guess, and I will never have to find out because I will never be back.",QehLpDI-ZdJJLu5dobDdxg
"Bought their jalape√±o pepperoni to bring home after dining next door.

Was absolutely blown away by the quality.

You might think the price is a bit high, but if you breakdown the price per weight it's on par with grocery store pepperoni but WAY better quality.

The staff were attentive and friendly.

I will definitely be coming here anytime I'm in the neighbourhood.",QehLpDI-ZdJJLu5dobDdxg
"My boyfriend recommended we go here for beef jerky. I thought sure why not... When we pulled into the small parking lot it was packed and I thought to myself... This is a good sign... We waited for someone to pull out and took the spot and headed in.... The smell was AMAZING! We wanted to stay and eat but it was packed and we chose not to wait, but will for sure be back. We got our jerky and headed out.... Yum and u get lots! The flavor is truly fantastic!  They have several different flavors, we tried garlic and original.",QehLpDI-ZdJJLu5dobDdxg
"I wish you could leave a 0 star review. My family went here for dinner and had the worst experience. First we waited for a long time at the front before even seeing anyone working to seat us, then spent our time waiting for our food just overhearing the workers loud conversations and swearing coming from the back. Those can be forgiven but then both my younger sister and mother were served RAW CHICKEN FINGERS.... completely raw. This is disgusting and very dangerous as both of them could get very sick. Will never been returning to this location or any others.",RY8I-VP7g-BMfGOSMA2lgg
"This is the second time my boyfriend and I have been to this location for breakfast and both times we've had a good experience. Obviously you have to take it for what it is. I wouldn't go to Smitty's for dinner, but for a nice hangover cure hot breakfast it's great. The restaurant is clean, the service is always really efficient and friendly and both times we went both of our breakfasts came out perfect. I gave them a perfect review because I honestly couldn't think of a single thing to complain about.",RY8I-VP7g-BMfGOSMA2lgg
"I came here for all you can eat fish Wednesday@ $16 or so.  It was the worst fish I ever had.  The fish fillet were all burnt and over fried.  The frying oil tasted so bad it must be old oil.  The corn kernels and the green peas were still stuck together in my plate as though these were not even warmed.
Price is so high just like a good restaurant but the food quality and presentation is extremely poor.
I will never come back here.
My advise taste the food before paying for it.
Owners appear to have left control to the workers with no oversight for the quality of the food being cooked and served properly in accordance to the good prices paid by the customers.",RY8I-VP7g-BMfGOSMA2lgg
"Jazmin hit the nail right on the head....you definitely have to take Smitty's for what it is. It is decent for breakfast or a light lunch but you are not going to find a filling dinner or gourmet food here.

I came in and had a chicken caesar wrap and fries. The wrap was decent and they put in whole chicken strips versus chicken chunks which I liked. They definitely go heavy on the lettuce though to make it look fuller than what it actually was.

The server was very pleasant although she did try and upsell the starters and desserts to the point it was getting a tad bit annoying. All in all it was a three star experience. The food was decent and a great value. I got a pop,wrap,fries,and a piece of pie for $21.00 plus tip. I would come back if I was in the neighborhood but would not go out of my way for it.",RY8I-VP7g-BMfGOSMA2lgg
Ate at the buffet. The food was okay but nothing special. Orange juice at Smitty's is amazing!,RY8I-VP7g-BMfGOSMA2lgg
"Very good place despite the location. This Korean food restaurant is located in the heart of China town. I went around lunch time and it was dead inside which means great service. The have several options, unfortunately not a lot of options for Vegetarians. My dish was pretty much a stir fry of clear noodles with mushrooms. My friend ordered a hot bowl that she said was delicious. Overall this restaurant is delicious but a bit pricey for the portion and food.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Lee House is located along the busy strip of 97 Street, right across from Lucky 97 Supermarket. It occupies the corner of a building and is much bigger than their location off of Whyte Avenue. The space is clean and furnished with tables, chairs, and decor straight from Korea. The decor is rustic and each table is equipped with a built in stove for Korean BBQ. With all the changes, I was excited when I finally had the chance to visit.

Along with the renovations, Lee House made some big changes to the menu. They kept the classic dishes, like their famous chicken balls, but also added some new ones - most notably, Korean street food, lunch boxes, and more soups.

One of my favourite street foods is ddukbokki, a combination of rice cakes and fish cakes in a spicy chili sauce. Lee House's Dubboki ($9.95) features rice cake sticks mixed with fish cakes, cabbage, and onion in a spicy sweet Korean chili sauce and a hard boiled egg. The mixture is gooey and has a nice spicy kick, and the rice cakes are cooked to a soft, chewy consistency. Unfortunately the sauce was too sweet for my liking, as I like my chili sauce to be on the savoury side.

The Jab Chae Bokeum ($12.95) at Lee House is my favourite jab chae in Edmonton. The combination of the sweet potato noodles with cabbage, carrot, onion, and black fungus in a sweet soy sauce is delicious. The noodles are stir fried with the perfect amount of oil so that the noodles don't stick together and it is deliciously garlicky. I love the chewy noodles and always order this dish when I visit Lee House.

To warm up on a cold day Korean soups and stews fit the bill. The Yuk Gae Jang ($12.95) came to the table in a bright red beef broth with shredded beef brisket, an egg, green onion, and shiitake mushroom. Given the colour, the stew surprisingly wasn't spicy. There was a nice portion of brisket but it felt like the dish was mostly broth. I would have loved if there were more substantial ingredients in it.

Overall, Lee House is a welcome addition to the busy Chinatown strip. Customer favourites from the original menu remain, and I'm looking forward to returning to try more of the new ones. Although I didn't try the BBQ items, I would definitely consider ordering some of the dishes for dinner when I have more time. Service is fairly quick, especially with a built in call bell at each table. The Whyte Avenue location recently re-opened following some renovations and I've heard that drastic changes have been made to the menu. Classic dishes are gone, and it's more of a location offering quick food options. So if you're craving your favourite Lee House dishes, Chinatown is the location you have to visit.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Just happened to eat here when my usual Pho place across the street was closed. So happy that I tried it :) 

I had the beef bulgogi bowl - it was great! It was very tasty and loved the egg on top. They even gave me a whole squeeze bottle of the spicy red pepper sauce, Yum! My friend had a spicy soup with beef and veggies and she loved it too. 

The service was very good and we had a great time.  We are definitely going back to try the Korean BBQ!",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Delicious Korean food, ready for take-away. Hadn't eaten here before, but tried the jap chae and pork belly bokkeum (stir fry). Completely delicious! Also tried the dry chicken wings, but they were a little bland. If I try the chicken again I'd get one of the other styles.  The serving size was HUGE though - the small portion of wings was enough for 3-4 people.

It's probably not the *healthiest* meal, but definitely a delicious treat now and then!",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
By far the best Korean joint in town. √üervice was top notch especially with the ring bell on each table,RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Feel ripped off. Ordered delivery from skip and paid $32 for 2 1/2  slivers of bbq short ribs. 
I see the pictures from others and that portion is way bigger dining in so why isn't delivery the same?!? 
Trying to support local restaurants in this pandemic only to be sent sub standard food. 
Beef soup was also very lacking in flavour and beef but was a bowl of bean sprouts in broth essentially. 
Called restaurant but was brushed off telling me that's how they rip people off and that's it deal with it. $80 for nothing pretty much. 
Never again!!",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
Absolutely there best Korean by far that I have had in Edmonton. Definitely be coming back again! Family owned just took over couple weeks ago. Doesn't look like much out side but inside if for sure authentic looking and clean. They play all kinds of Korean music not just K-pop. We order bulgogi beef and the bibimbab bowl with beef. Both were just down right delicious. Sorry no picture it was ate so quick. None left . Mmmmm,RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
Cheap about the side dishes. The chicken balls (wet) is awesome. The bulgogi ginger Anne spicy pork bulgogi were below average. I don't like how the meat is cut. Service is good.,RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
Decent quality of food but quite expensive for how much you get,RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"The menu of Korean food here may have you scratching your head as to what to order, but all you need to remember is get the bibimbap, bulgogi and pot stew and you'll be sorted. Of course, those who venture out may be pleasantly surprised by its various Korean dishes too. 
Placed in China Town, it's a great spot for those working in the areas that have a hankering for Korean barbecue plates, from short ribs to chicken thigh.

I like the bibimbap the crunchiness of the rice in hot stone bowl is the best! I just don't like that the fried chicken is a little bit sweet and the seafood pancake is not flavorful. I like the ambiance so relaxing and the brown rice tea is amazing. Customer service is good.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
First time here tonight.  Had the marinated  beef bulgogi  was excellent. son had fried chicken. He liked it but fairly bland but juicy.  Kimchi pancake was very good. The pork bokkeum was the best new dish I have tried in a long time spicy and full of flavor. Have eaten Korean food all over Asia and this ranks high on my list. Great service and I though inexpensive for the amount of food.  No problem feeding four of us.   Highly recommend this place and we will be back again and again!!!,RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"This is our second visit after they reopened in September 2017. We ordered kimchi pancake, pork bone soup, jjajangmyeon, bulgogi, ddukbaegi, and japchae this time. The food are delicious and the services are great.  The price is reasonable as well. Will definitely come back again.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"What a delightful surprise in the heart of Chinatown and in what I have to say is a sketchy outward appearance. Delicious Korean cuisine served by a lovely server. Loved the bulgogi noodles and bibimbap. The fried chicken, although hot, crispy, and moist, lacked flavour so if we were to order again, would choose one that came with a sauce. Loved the little side dishes that came with the meal, typical of Korean meals. The space is clean, bright and welcoming. I look forward to our return!",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Loved it here! It's very authentic Korean equipped even with the ""ping-pong"" sounding button for service. Very efficient service system! 

We had the spicy bulgogi ($15), the Kim chi pancake ($12) and the 1/2 order of Lee House chicken ($18). It also included the side dishes of Kim chi, spicy daikon, soy beans, seaweed and a single bowl of rice. Spicy and savory all dishes really packed a punch. Delicious but not recommended if you are sensitive to chillies! The food was plentiful and we took half of our meal home. 

Service was great. Restaurant was clean. Bathrooms were clean. They even have super energetic K-Pop in the background in case you had any doubts on what kind of restaurant you are in. 

I can't want to go back. Miss it already!",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"My friend and I made a point of going to eat in China town for the first time. So after driving 2-3 times up and down 97 st, trying to see through the darkness and September snow, we decided it would be Lee house. 

It was pretty full when we got in. They were two big groups but that didn't stop the staff to promptly give ya our seat. We had good and friendly service throughout the night.

The place was clean and had a gas operated stove top on the table. Previously, you would cook your own meat there but due to lack of ventilation it's only for hot pot now.

We ordered the hot stone wild mushroom Bibimpap, Bibimpap and a Bulgogi. They were all very tasty.


And of course it came with refillable side!

My experience was great and I am certain I'll go back there.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"As I saw that this restaurant had pretty good reviews on Yelp, I had to give it a try. I took a friend of mine from the store that I'm serving as a consultant to, with me, and we both had two good meals. I went with the stone pot bibimbap and my friend chose to go with the gold Gogi. They came with for side dishes. They were kimchi, marinated bean sprouts, spiced seaweed and some marinated Potato Sticks.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"We went here for my daughters birthday. Wifey had a great time and loved all the food!

"My daughter and I had lunch at Lee House today, and really enjoyed it. We found out about the place on yelp, and thought because of the good ratings we would give it a try. 

We were not disappointed. Firstly the place is spotless.  That is always a good sign. The waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu which helped too. 

Sara and I started with kimchi pancakes. Not as spicy as I thought they would be, but they had nice flavour. 

For the main course we both had the stone bowl bibimbap. It was excellent. The oven hot bowl was sizzling when it arrived which gave the rice a nice crust. Once mixed together with a little sweet hot sauce and garnished with kimchi and saut√©ed veggies it was fantastic. 

We will be back, and next time we will bring the whole family.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A

"Edmonton has a real lack of KBBQ spots compared to Calgary, which is a real disappointment since I've never been to an authentic KBBQ place. Midnight late searching lead me to find Lee house, so I begged the boyfriend to go!

The one thing that drew me in was that they had table top grilling, the one thing I wanted to try again. So when we got to lee house, imagine my disappointment when the server told us there was a fire ban so they'd have to cook it in the kitchen :(

We ordered the LA Kalbi from a lot of raves I saw on yelp, the famous friend chicken half portion, and the bulgolgi. There was a lot of banchan (side dishes) that came with the food, but we only really stuck to the rice. 

My favourite was tied between the fried chicken and bulgolgi. The fried chicken was something I was weary about ordering since whenever I order saucy chicken from Korean or Chinese restaurants, it usually disappoints me. But this was definitely one of the best fried chicken's I've ever had! The sauce was delicious, spicy and not over bearing but didn't leave your tongue burning at the end. A bit pricy, 18$ for a half order but it was worth it. 

The bulgolgi, I was also pretty weary about since I've never tried it and the meat itself looked very bland, but I was SO wrong. Even though it had a lack lustre appearance, it was definitely full of flavour. The only bad thing about the dish was that there was definitely more vegetables (cabbage) than actual bulgolgi. 

Now for the LA kalbi.... 
it was definitely not worth the $25 dollars. It's 4 slices of beef, and you'd think for something that pricy you want more quantity and quality, but it wasn't the case. I'd honestly tasted better kalbi at Koryo in the malls. Don't order it if you have high expectations for it. 

Over all, I paid around $80 including the tip for the meal. I think I should've spent my money else where as I don't think the 3 dishes were really worth it. The fried chicken and bulgolgi were definitely dishes I'd come back for, but I'd skip the Kalbi.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"I've been waiting for what seems like ages for Lee House's latest restaurant to open up shop. Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.

Anyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.

While we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.

We ordered:
- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.
- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. 
- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.
- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. 
- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.
- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.

So to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We'll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling! I'm impressed with all the good Korean restaurants in town - make sure to add this one to your list of must try.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Everybody has a list of restaurants that they refer to when the question of ""where shall we eat out tonight?"" comes up. Old Strathcona's Lee House is one of those restaurants on my list. Whenever I'm in doubt, or just not feeling up to review or try a new, up and coming shop, Joe and I go to Lee House. It's one of our favourites for ""hotpot"" stews and the all notorious KFC, Korean fried chicken. Wing Chicx and Coco Deep Fried Chicken may have increased the Korean chicken popularity, but Lee House was one of the first, and one of oldest Korean restaurants in Edmonton.

At time of writing, the Old Strathcona location is undergoing a facelift, but have no fear. They've opened up another shop, this time right on 97 St Chinatown across from the anchoring Lucky 97 Supermarket. It's even closer to us now. I couldn't be happier! The new Lee House offers more BBQ items with stations at each table, something their original location did not. Currently, they are offering the full menu (plus new dishes) and an array of BBQ dishes. I was told that when they reopen their Old Strathcona location though, the menus will be different. Can't wait to see two distinct spaces. For now though, here's what Joe and I had last week at their grand opening night.


To start, we had the ""Gang Jung Chicken"", crispy-fried chicken thigh strips and rice cakes, tossed in a honey, soy, sesame glaze and topped with green onions. Joe and I had recently traveled to Seoul and one my most memorable meals was ""cup chicken"", a cup of deep fried chicken pieces, crispy rice cakes, tossed in with tater tots, mixed with a sweet spicy glaze and mayo sauce. Oh my God. I had seconds. And thanks to the GPS tracking on my phone, I know exactly where to find it. I'll eventually post my Seoul trip one day... it's a big project. Anyways, sidetracking. So that's why we ordered the dish. Flavours were there although I wished there was an option of a sweet spicy sauce. The kitchens and staff seemed frantically busy that night so the rice cakes were a little on the chewy, overcooked side and were beginning to harden by the time I got into the dish. Otherwise, it would have been a home run! You'll notice that wrote ""I"" got into the dish. Joe's ""allergic"" (questionable...) to peanuts. We don't normally make a point to asking if dishes have peanuts on them but we probably should. There's peanuts all over this dish. Beware!

Joe wanted to order our usual stew again, but I put my foot down. We need to try the meats and BBQ! That is, after all, what the location will be specializing in. We can always to go the Old Strathcona location once it opens up for the stew! We're not the biggest meat eaters so it was safer for us to order only one kind of meat for the BBQ station and one sizzling hot plate dish. The ""Spicy Pork Loin Bulgogi"" came out piping hot, thinly sliced and tender, and marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy sauce. Yuuuuum, and not overly spicy!

Our BBQ item: ""L.A. Kalbi"" arrived at the same time but took a few minutes for it to be cooked. A traditional marinade of Asian pear, soy, honey, garlic and sesame, these were soooooo good. Honestly, how can you go wrong with short ribs. All BBQ items (with the exception of sizzling hot plate dishes) come with a variety of sides: assorted lettuce greens, miso paste, raw garlic, Korean chill paste, and an onion salad to cut the heat. Nom nom nom. I need to go back ASAP to try the ""Won Kalbi"", a bone-in ribeye filet, and the pork belly. I have a feeling the ""L.A. Kalbi"" is a winner though. The meat is cooked for you, our server coming around to adjust the heat and check up on it regularly. Seasoned veterans I'm sure can BBQ the meats themselves though and they wouldn't mind.

Other menu items that look promising: an array of jeon, a traditional savoury egg, flour batter mixture with vegetables, with or without meat or seafood; a fried chicken lunch box with a choice of their amazing kam poong gi (fried chicken balls), or Lee House chicken (KFC); and some stews and soups that I swear weren't on the menu before... like the rice cake pot stew. Drools. As per usual, a variety of banchan (side dishes) - kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled radish, spinach - came with our meal and a bowl of rice each.

Looking forward to the re-opening of their Old Strathcona location and can't wait to see the two locations of Lee House serve different menus! I didn't think I would be craving Korean food this soon after my trip to Seoul, but boy. Lee House sure hits the spot. Congratulations to Lee House on their expansion, I will be back soon!",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Having craved Korean Barbecue since I moved here from Toronto. I was sad to find a lack of open stove Korean Barbecue restaurants in Edmonton (due to some sort of open flame table top issue? I'm not 100% sure on that). This was the next best thing we found. The food here was delightful, we had kimchi fried rice, beef bulgogi and the famous fried chicken. The kimchi fried rice and the chicken had a bit of heat but wasn't over powering. The beef bulgogi was very flavourful and the complementary sides were just the right sizes for 2 or 3 people (there is a one extra free round policy on the sides but it wasn't an issue for us). Servers were friendly and I would come back again.  The decor was nice and service was incredibly fast. My only gripe which isn't a big one is that it's a bit on the pricey side of things but I've found that to be the case with most ethnic foods in the Edmonton area so I won't knock them for that. Overall I would come again. Expect to spend around $40-50 or so for 2 people depending on what you order.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"An excellent place for Korean food in Edmonton. Really enjoyed the spicy pork neck bone soup. It was a large portion for a decent price. I had four side dishes that were plentiful and very tasty. It wasn't that busy but it seemed there was only one person taking orders and bringing out food. So if you're tucked away on the side, it is hard to get noticed even though you ring the bell a few times. Yes, each table has a little button to ring a little bell for someone to come to your table. Service was overall okay and the restaurant was nice and clean. Staff were polite and friendly.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Brought some friends with us to Lee House this past holiday Monday. Thankfully they were open considering it was a holiday and we could also make reservations. Our friends love ethnic foods but I have never been to Lee House so my hubby and I did the ordering. We ordered a hot stone bowl rice with veggies known as the dol sot bibimbap, bulgolgi beef, fried chicken and a huge pot of pork bone stew. 

They were super understaffed and had quite a few tables ordering  on Monday so food too a bit more time to arrive. We also ran into some issues with the hot plate for our pork bone stew so that took a while to figure out. We did have other food items arrive in meantime so that was good. Eventually, they gave us a portable burner to cook the stew. 

Everything else was delicious. I always like how the fried chicken is not oily yet still juicy! The bibimbap arrived hot and sizzling. There was one small issue with our bulgolgi as well but they apologized for that and even took it off our bill. 

Overall, good location and food. I'm sure the next time we go it won't be as short staffed. Perhaps Monday was just an off day. Go check them out at their downtown location for now as the one on gateway is still closed for renos.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Upon an error in thinking there was a E.S.O. concert to watch tonight,  I ended coming to Lee House instead with a friend. It opens till 10 PM on weekdays so that is handy.

This use to be the one by Whyte Ave on Calgary Trail. So for those who remember that location this place has a lot more room.

The food is pretty good for the pricing. The spiciness of the Kim Chi is a little on the light side however some might like it like that.  All in all its a good place to come eat at. They have dishes that you can order and share by table top cooking so definitely bring some friends and have a nice meal together.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"This is the only thing you ever need to eat here. Well probably the regular Almost famous fried chicken, bibimbap, and black bean noodles, but it's the chicken balls that keep me coming back. These hand rolled and potato starched chicken balls is big enough for 2, considering the regular korean side dishes of kim chi and such also come out after you order. The Korean chicken here is pretty decently breaded and sauced that it's worth probably getting both the wet and dry versions. The sauced chicken is so spice for a little child, so if you're pretty sensitive to spiciness you can just have the sauce on the side and venture at your own risk.

Located in Chinatown, there used to be 2 locations, but i think the one that is located off whyte is being renovated or doesn't exist....i don't know, go google it. Pretty standard korean restaurant so don't forget to press the button on the table to get service or else you'll be staring at the waitress all night and not get any water.

Sal says: Just try it",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Incredibly classy place in the heart of Chinatown. The restaurant is bright, spacious and clean, and the service is excellent. The tables have heating pads on them, in case you order any of the shareable hot pot kinds of meals. I went for the clay pot Bulgogi, which had lots of beef and glass noodles, and was in a broth that was rich and had flavour points that reminded me of plum sauce. Meals are served with four sides: potato noodles, seaweed, kimchi, and bean sprouts. The menu is very details (indicating spicy, gluten-free, and such) and prices are on the higher side, but reasonable. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"We hadn't been to Lee House in a while... not since they were in their old location south of Whyte Ave. We were cutting across the city last night from the Richie area back to St. Albert and decided to drive down the 97th Chinatown area hoping something would jump out at us for dinner. Lee House, did and we are glad it worked out that way.

The Korean Fried Chicken here is incredible. Last night we tried the garlic soy for the first time. Personally I prefer the original (spicy) but the garlic soy was damn tasty too. We also tried the kimchi fried rice and the Spicy Bulgogi last night, paired with Buck Wheat tea. Everything was great, including the service. Quiet on a Sunday evening and just what we wanted. The new 97 Street location is nice and much bigger than the old location. Another great dining option in Edmonton's awesome Chinatown area.",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
"Been looking for a korean bbq restaurant. Saw the pictures posted here with the grills; but I guess they took them off cuz there were no table bbq grills when I went. They currently grill them for u in the kitchen... which is no fun. 
Food is quite authentic though, but really bummed that they no longer offer table grill...",RuBWR6CAgVi7iWR8LHUi6A
I like this place in downtown Edmonton.  It has a good menu at reasonable prices and 72 beers on tap. The decor is modern and dark and lounge like.  It is located in the basement and looks sketchy from the outside but very nice inside.   Like an urban lounge. You take an escalator down.  The chicken stir fry was excellent with many veggies.  The burgers have great salads.  Like tapioca? You will find it here.  Good for a date.,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Service used to be excellent.  Waited 10min before I was asked what I would like to drink.  Ordered meal at the same time. 30 minutes later no food.  Was a simple 7 oz steak.  Still waiting and up to 35 min.
The food is good here.  Service has cratered.
Do not recommend coming here unless you have lots and lots of time to kill and do not mind waiting extended periods of time for average food.
The Saison Cassis beer was excellent.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Great atmosphere and friendly staff! The on tap beer choices were thoughtfully selected to satisfy a wide range of tastes.,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Plenty of open tables during the early evening on a Friday night and definitely an older crowd. 

The service was a little slow of the get-go to notice myself and a friend had joined 2 people who were already there, but afterwards our server did a pretty good job of keeping up with us. 

My burger was pretty good but not amazing. It was superior to any fast food burger but didn't have the extra oomph to bring it up to a gastropub amazing creation - it didn't help that there was only 1 on the menu. I had a side salad with it and it was also pretty good. Not phenomenal but there wasn't anything particularly not good about it. I appreciated that the dressing was on the side (without me even asking for it that way). 

Their beer menu was extensive but most of it was pretty expensive (they had a decent selection of $7 beers and then quite a few $8 and $9 beers, but very little under $7). That said, most things they had on tap I literally haven't seen anywhere else. 

I did notice other people with beer flights and I would have actually loved to try one - but aside from a note about them being $xx off on a certain day, they weren't in the menu at all. Without knowing the price ahead of time, as well as which beers would be in it, I didn't feel like putting in an order. Too bad. 

Overall, I would definitely come here again. Probably not somewhere I'll be craving or anything, but definitely no black marks in my book.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Good food, great drink prices. Go on a night where the special suits your wants. Nice little place to grab a beer and watch the game, enjoyable atmosphere.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"amazing beer selection. the food is amazing as well. the BLT soup is to die for!

downside is service isn't that great. the waitresses don't have good knowledge of the beer or drinks in general. and the place often has a strong odor of stale beer when you first enter.

but if you're looking to escape the heat and enjoy some new beer and have an awesome meal this is a good place.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"went when it was not busy at all so i can't speak about the service during a rush, but the taste, presentation, and value of the food and drinks here is off the charts. you can pay the same amount at another restaurant, but what you get will not be this high quality. i definitely recommend the tequila twilight for sweet cocktail lovers, or dark and stormy for people who aren't as big a fan of sweetness but still want something that genuinely tastes good. the dessert presentation was so nice too. basically, if you're on jasper ave, this place is worth it.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Previously had great experiences here. But last night I waited 10 minutes to get in, sat down....and that was it. 15 minutes later, no waitress. We got up and left and went somewhere else.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I wish I could rate this place higher as it's the only place in the city with my all time favourite beer on tap, however the three stars is fair. 

Even when you sit at the wood here the service is normally a bit slow and standoffish which is odd.  

The room itself isn't exactly inviting and the setup just seems off.  I can't pinpoint what it is but it doesn't feel comfortable really at all.  

Good specials and they had decent food which is nice that's in their favor.  

Keep the Rogue Nut Brown on tap and I'll still be coming back.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"The Underground Tap & Grill is a great gem in the heart of downtown Edmonton. The restaurant is located in the lower level (below ground) of a building on Jasper Ave & 100 St. At one time they had an escalator at the front entrance to bring guests into the restaurant, but after mechanical issues and the cost to maintain they removed it from their restaurant. Now, stairs is the way to enter the restaurant and I believe there is an elevator but I could be wrong.

The restaurant has a good feel to it. Not to dark and not too bright - just the right amount of light for a place to escape for a drink or two. Atmosphere is great, updated and clean but it is not unique or their ""own."" It is typical decor of a modern pub/restaurant and I believe they could have ""fun"" making this their own - especially with a name like the Underground Tap & Grill.

The place however is quite clean. Bathrooms were great, seat coverings walls, tables, bar were well maintained. No appearances of anything needing to be replaced. 

The tap and grill offered 72 rotating taps - so if you are a fan of craft or independent breweries, this is the place to come too! I believe they also support Alberta breweries quite well as their claim to fame is having the largest Alberta selection of beer in Edmonton! They also rotate their kegs every Thursday bringing in new selection.

They great thing about this place was the staff and how they serve. We had a young man who was the barkeep provide us with some of the best service I have ever experienced. We were sitting at the bar and it was a packed night. He was quick on his feet, remembered our names and was quite personal. It was a great experience!

Part of the experience was asking the young man for a number of flights (6 small glasses of beer) of his choosing. We told him what we liked for taste and what we would want to avoid. The young man was amazing - he took notes and within time had a selection for us! He told us about each beer and then let us do our own thing! Beer was great and it was a nice touch to our time at the Underground.

Food was dynamite. I was a little concerned with the menu as it was all over the map for dishes. Their was Mexican, American, Indian and so many other dishes that I didn't know if this would be a great ""food"" place to eat at. However, talking to our server he told us that they had a chef who would rotate dishes on the menu. Prices were ok but the specials were amazing. Supposedly Tuesdays are Taco Tuesday - $3 dollars each between dinner and 9 I believe. We had some appetizers, some other dishes and a few more beers and we were sold on this place.

If I had any concerns or critiques I would have to say it would be the advertising or signage of the restaurant. You just might miss it if you are looking, but if you aren't you definitely will miss it. The Underground is a wonderful place for friends to gather at. Seating can accommodate all sizes of groups. In general, prices are ok, beer is excellent and food was great - just maybe too many dishes and variety for a menu.

I would return again, but check it out and decide for yourself!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've only been to this establishment twice; I've tried their apple chicken sandwich -- it's good! My coworkers raved about their fries. One of them quite enjoyed the spring onion sandwich -- which is sort of weird because it's almost like eating a doughnut sandwich with pulled pork in it -- it's a knife and fork kind of meal. If you are torn between several beers, you could order a sampler with various 5 oz glasses for $11. (Total 20 ounces)
The only thing new that I've tried is Loki. It's good -- not too sweet, just a hint of caramel.
The only qualms I have got about this place is their supply chain management. It often seems they're always out of many beers. I had really wanted to try the pumpkin beer, but they were out. But hey, as long as they've got Boddingtons on tap? I won't complain.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Atmosphere was nice, though some of the music was questionable. My beer was served in a dirty glass and my burger was overcooked and served on a burnt bun. The burger was a good size though and fries were pretty good. My friend's pasta was salty and the portion size was small.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Edmonton's First Authentic Craft Beer Lounge, I just left work downtown Edmonton and am recovering from the flu on a cloudy drissly evening.  I spoke to a co-worker who had a flyer about this new 'pub' that opened recently.  The first thing I thought of was 'English pub style' however I did have to investigate further, feeling exhausted and weakened as I was recovering from the flu I went into the Treasury building, and glided down the escalators to the lower level where I found a tidy/clean upscale 'pub'.  I did not realize that I was about to be 'hooked' into tasting a couple of specialty brews.   However, I kept myself composed as I ordered the onion-fennel soup French-style.  The warmly brewed broth underneath the melting cheese hit the spot, I felt at home.  This specialty soup is part of the main menu a must  for lovers of French onion soup.  There are  72 craft and micro-brewed beers on tap; included within this group of offerings 12 additional draft lines will be rotated every month.  The pub has a chalkboard posting the monthly flavours.  I had the  Lindeman's Framboise (Belgium) fruit beer which was more like a dessert wine, however it definitely was a brewed beer to celebrate my partially Belgium heritage.  I also had a tasting of Sir Perry Pear Cider (England) this is not too sweat but has a very gentle fruity taste.   I was impressed, the owner/manager came over to my table and introduced himself along with a huge smile he indicated that one time was not enough to taste everything that they had to offer and I realized why he was the owner/manager.  The waitress I had was personable and approachable, I think that this establishment is a huge asset for the downtown area.  I was looking for a place to go, and the theme song from the TV show 'Cheers' was going through my mind.........'Where everyone knows your name'  Cheers! to this new club.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"When it comes down to fine beers and wines, there are not many places in Edmonton that have an amazing selection. Underground really impressed me with their beer selection. I am myself a wine drinker but I found some very special brands that I had a lot of fun trying. Since they offer tasting of the beers before you get a whole pint, it allowed me to find something I very much enjoyed. This place has a modern but warm look, and felt fairly cozy to me.

I will definitely go back to Underground.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
It's been a while since I've been here and so we decided to come here for dinner. It wasn't too busy when we got here which was nice. I ordered the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries on the side and it came out like a master piece. The bun was super soft and the Ahi Tuna slices were nice and thick. My sweet potato fries were also very crunchy and fresh. It made me wonder why I haven't been here more often! My boyfriend ordered the chicken burger and it also looked and tasted delicious. The service was good since it wasn't so busy. I am definitely coming back here again for food. They have a good selection of local beers as well. Local beers for $5 on certain days and they also have wing nights. Check out their specials it's pretty worth it! The only complaint that I would say I had was the water. Water is served out of these clear glass bottles... That look pretty old. I have a feeling that they pre pour water into these bottles and then give them to tables. It didn't look fresh... or perhaps the glass bottles had hard water stains on them or calcium stains? But that kind of threw  me off. I didn't really drink water so it didn't really matter perhaps this was just a one off... Other then the water thing I think the overall quality of food and service was good. I am definitely going to come  back here for food again!,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Few points:
-This really is an underground restaurant, as in you have to take an escalator to get to the restaurant. I lost an unofficial bet this way. 
-There is free wifi though it is spotty. 
-There is purposeful graffiti on the restroom walls. File this under ""mildly amusing."" 
-Polite service but really slow. It's fine when you're not in a rush, but consider a packed lunch hour compounded with being tight on time. 
-Ordered the bison burger with minestrone. The minestrone was stellar, considering it was vegan. The packet of saltine crackers made me extra happy. The bison burger, however, was subpar. As much as I like bleu cheese every now and then, it overpowered the meat. Would have preferred more bison, less bleu.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"The Underground is a cozy spot beneath Club XO. Don't let its proximity to XO throw you off; I've yet to see a wannabe gangster darken its doors. Its basement location makes the space feel warmer, and cave-like, perfect for a place to escape a cold winter night.

With a great selection of beer on tap, The Underground specializes in craft beers. You won't be able to get a pint of Kokanee here. Instead, both local and international brews you won't find elsewhere are on tap. Over the years, I've fallen in love with a selection of their draught, ranging from Chestnut Ale to Pumpkin Pie Spiced Ale. All delicious. 

The food here won't blow you away, but it is reasonably good. I really enjoy the chipotle chicken wrap, and their vegetable pakora. Their take on Pad Thai is serviceable, too, but unfortunately the curry is a no-go - it's very bland and flat.

The servers here are very friendly and usually efficient. There have been a couple of times where our table felt forgotten, but even when this was the case, our servers were sweet enough to make up for it. 

I'm glad The Underground is in my neighbourhood. I've found the food hit-or-miss, but the beers are delicious and the service friendly, so it remains a regular in my pub rotation.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Served us a beer that was off - from a distance smelled like malt vinegar.  Server agreed it was off, took it away and then kept it on the bill!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"This is by far the best beer bar in Edmonton.  72 taps of all craft beer, not a Molson product to be found.  The downstairs location adds a bit of a speakeasy feel and the staff really does know their product and can make quality recommendations.  The beers are always rotating and always a wide selection of styles.

The food is generally good too, the Ramen soup is great and the appies are usually quite good.  Unfortunately they changed the menu a few months ago and I think the fish tacos are gone.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've eaten lunch at The Underground Tap and Grill a number of times so it was a natural choice when I met up with some colleagues for lunch.  This is a popular night spot but it isn't very busy at noon. They have a wide variety of tables so regardless of the size of your group they can handle it. My friends and I wanted to catch-up so we appreciated that The Underground isn't too noisy. It's not ""romantic date night"" quiet but it's a place where people can talk and hear each other.   The waiters were very attentitive and made us feel like they genuinely wanted us to be there.  I ordered the UG burger  which is made of bison meat. I upgraded the fries to yam fries (to ensure I get my veggies). It was delicious and very tidy as it didn't drip over my fingers as I ate it. In prior visits I ordered the onion cake burger which is especially good but somewhat messy. The size was perfect. We were satisfied but not stuffed. I can't comment about their drinks because we didn't order drinks since most of our group had to return to work but the beer list is extensive. I will keep coming to The Underground because the food is always good and the location is so handy. They have one or two excellent vegitarian selections.  Really I can easily recommend The Underground to anyone or any size of group. Take the train though as this is the heart of Edmonton's downtown so parking can be a challenge to find.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I could talk about their food. I could talk about the beers they have on tap. I could talk about their service. 

What I will talk about, however, is something that, in my opinion, is much more important that semantics. 

This bar/ grill/ taphouse/ whatever you want to call it was one of only about 3 places in Edmonton that was kind enough to help a man out. 

(Un?) fortunately, I lost my wallet earlier in the day and although I could have traveled out to Sherwood Park to get food at home I decided to see what Jasper Ave. had to offer. After searching around for a bit I managed to stumble upon this establishment. 

Despite not having my wallet (although I did have a piece of government issued ID in my special pocket) the whole team at The Underground was kind enough to let me open up a tab, eat/ drink what I pleased and come back and pay the next day. 

Although I realize this was a special circumstance and certainly wouldn't expect this treatment every time I really do appreciate the understanding and trust that the management had. 

Cheers and keep up the good work.



Ps. Tried the recently tapped Blue Dragon when I was there (this was approx. 3 weeks ago) and although I was not the most impressed I'll certainly be back to try more. Especially ciders. Yum.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I appreciate very much the generosity of this establishment, they provide 1 ounce tasters (free of cost) so that when you order your beer you know what it will taste like.  They also provide a tasting menu where you can order a round of several different varieties of beers for a 'minimal' cost.  I think that this kind of service is world class.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I went here last week with a few friends and the service was horrible. Our server seemed like she was way too busy and yet the manager kept seating her tables. We had to wait forever for everything, drinks, food, and to pay. I don't think it was the servers fault, the manager seemed completely unaware of what was going on, or only concerned with profit from max customers. They may want to think about the benefit of repeat customers instead.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"This place has an above average craft beer selection, friendly enough staff (although the service can be a bit slow on occasion even when not that busy), decent menu (some standard pub food offerings and some stuff that tries to aim a bit fancier), room to accommodate your group even on weekends usually, and (huge plus for me) reasonable conversational volume.

But the main reason I'm writing this review is to give a shout out to a server named Brittany (according to the receipt), because last Saturday (the 25th) a friend of mine paid in cash and told her to keep the change, and Brittany pointed out that a 20% gratuity was included in the bill due to our group size, asked if he still wanted her to keep the change in that case, and provided his change when he rescinded after being told about the included gratuity.

Having visited bars where servers have literally put some of my change into their tip jars without my consent before handing me the rest (knowing that they could claim I was being belligerent and eject me if I contested this), Brittany's integrity and honesty on this matter, when nobody would have raised an eyebrow if she just took the money, impressed me and represented the Underground well.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I can't think of anything else I would look for in a neighbourhood beer haunt, beyond it actually being in my neighbourhood, since it's that damn good. On second thought, it's probably best that it's not much closer to home.

The servers are knowledgeable, the free tasters were highly unexpected and very much appreciated, the music is not too loud, it's got great decor... oh yes, and a ton of beer. Very well-selected and well-described beer, so you don't get the double-fisted hop-puncher by mistake when you'd really just like some light, unoffensive lager.

I can't say I'm overly concerned about the presence of some macro-owned micro-brew; when you're trying to cater to a wide audience, you need to have some somewhat familiar offerings to get people started. Then you get them hooked on a nice, tasty double-fisted hop-puncher and they're yours for good!

So, 5 full stars to the Underground - it's the most solid craft/micro brewhouse I've been to and well worth a visit.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Stopped in here tonight for a quick pint before the Santa Claus parade. I've tried really hard to like this place, I love that they're a small business. But they're making it had to love them. First, I can't get over the toilet smell and the prices out out of this world. I love the selection and I understand there's a cost to drinking obscure beers to Edmonton. But, throw in a few cheapies in the mix and don't charge $7 for a beer brewed three blocks away. Tonight, my husband was offered a couple of samples prior to picking his pint and we were a bit surprised to find $0.60 on our bill for the samples.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Disappointed.  How this place can claim to be a ""craft"" beer bar is beyond me.

A substantial amount of the offerings are produced by large macro-breweries like the world's largest brewery AB-InBev (Boddington's, Leffe, Stella), SABMiller (Creemore, Pilsner Urquell, Grolsch), Sapporo, or Guiness (Harp, Kilkenny, Smithwicks).  Not to mention offerings from Heineken (Newcastle) and Carlsberg (Kronenbourg) portfolios.

This constant smokeshow of purporting macro-owned imports for ""craft"" or ""micro"" brewed beers does nothing but miseducate the public as to what craft beer actually is.  It might even be worse than the fallacy that AB InBev keeps alive insisting that Alexander Keith's is actually an IPA.

It might be a good place to get a beer, but stop with this insistance you are a craft establishment.  Both MKT and this place commit the same sin, co-opting the actual craft beer movement in order to push offerings from giant brewers who prefer to use cheap adjuncts in their beers.  

Its fine if this is what you want to serve, just don't tell the public you are actually serving something else, it actually hurts the small brewers who sweat blood in order to make an inroads into the beer market and actually produce something noteworthy or interesting.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Overall - 3.5/5.0

A goto spot for dinner when I'm here for work. This place has an extensive selection of beer on tap and has an option for beer flights as well as 1oz tasters if you want to try different ones.

Their daily dinner and drink specials does the job. I have had their steak specials (i.e. $12.50 for a 7oz on Mondays and $3.00 tacos w/ $9 flights on Tuesdays). Steak was simple but grilled perfectly and the tacos were substantial and flavourful. 

This place also brings a cozy environment and friendly vibe. There are also TV screens for you to catch a game or two.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Definitely try the green onion cake with pulled pork delicious, 66 types of beer on tap",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. I had the duck confit poutine. AMAZING! Fresh cut Kennebec potatoes and tender shredded duck with the most umptious gravy. I am still thinking of this gravy... mmmmm. Also tried the bison blue cheese burger with Caesar salad. The blue cheese was too overpowering and ruined an otherwise tasty, juicy bison patty. The calamari was ok but the onions and peppers that accompanied it was delicious! The caesars were also well mixed. There is also an extensive array of craft beers if this is your thing. I will definitely be going back for more of that gravy!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"This is an interesting craft beer location. I love that every time I go I can have a different beer I've never heard of before. What I don't love is sometimes that means having beers that are really not to my taste, while other times I find gems. I found the bartenders and waitresses, while they know their beers, don't know many other drinks. And have a hard time suggesting something to your specific tastes, if it isn't on special. However the sheer amount of beers and the impressive 24 rotational beers make this a location that I can keep coming back to. Especially with groups of people, the problem with that however is table space, this is a place best shared with large groups and there isn't enough space for everyone, especially with small groups of 2 or 3 taking up full booths or eight person tables. This normally is only a problem on weekends however. My favorite nights to go are Mondays (there is local comedy) and Tuesdays when there aren't as many people but it's still the same great place.

The food is mediocre, but no one is coming here for the food. I've had a different things each time I've gone (six or seven times) and everything from the appies to the desert has always left me sort of meh and wishing I had just bought another beer instead of buying food.

It's a great place to go with a big group of friends (as long as you are willing to wait for a table on weekends, or go during the week) and try out new beers or craft beers that you won't find on draft anywhere else in the city.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"This is one of our favorite spots in downtown Edmonton. We usually end up here mid-week for a late night drink/snack and it hasn't been too full or busy for us. It usually ends up being a small quiet crowd actually. 

They have a massive beer selection with a rotating selection so I usually get to try something new when I am there. If you don't already you should try out an App called ""Untappd"". It lets you log your beer/cider drinks you try. So when you do try something new you can log it into your app for future reference. And if you need to find that ""hard to find beer"" I usually hit up Sherbrooke Liquor. They have the biggest selection in town.

Now back to The Underground! They have some Gluten Free and Vegan/vegetarian options. The food is really really great here. We haven't tried anything we don't like and haven't had anything come out that wasn't cooked/presented well. Service has always been good. They have nice big booths, table seating and bar seating. We usually pick a nice big booth to sit at. Atmosphere is casual and they usually showcase local art on the wall, which you can buy.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"A couple of years ago I honestly would not have given this place good rating. 

I'm not sure if they are under new management, or what's going on, but this place has seriously stepped their game up. A large list of rotational taps and you can always find something you'll enjoy. Whether you're into imperial stouts, a hop head or just want a simple lager, you will find more than a couple beers you want to drink at this place. 

I've eaten a few times here, and the last few times have been a big step up from what I saw in the past. I often forget about Underground, but this place is really awesome. 

If you haven't been, check it out. If you had a mediocre experience in the past, check it out again, because they have taken it to a new level.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Very cool. Great selection of beers and the duck poutine is amazing. The burgers are also great. I think they use brioche buns. They were super soft and delicious.,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I have been to this place on at least three occasions. Never have been disappointed. Food is consistently good and the service just as good. Wide variety of craft beers. Everything I like in a place to go after work. Menu specials change and I failed to have a poor meal. For a pub, this combines a fantastic selection of brews with an even better selection of food. I guess that's why it is packed after 5:00.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Everybody who rate below at least 4 stars is spoiled...honestly people wake up, first of all it's Deadmonton and you have selection of 72 tap awesome beers, only to look at this it's impressive. You don't live in Antwerp, Munich or Oregon to complain. 
The selection of imports is excellent and they carry amazing quality stuff(Belgium quadruple anyone?) stuff and rotation menu is all about local craft beer.
So please take a head from behind your legs and enjoy amazing beer at this amazing place! Food is regular bar food, but prices are reasonable and my fish and chip was actually great. But honestly you come here for beer, not for food. Did I mention 72 fresh tap amazing selection? If you don't like to sample different types of beer how about you find some other place? 
Service is also top-notch!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Interesting and very varied pub food.  They have like 100 beers on tap plus bottles. Not s draw for me but may be for someone...Appetizers are 1/2 off on Sunday so I guess I'll take advantage. Sticky pork belly sliders... adobo buffalo duck wings....ending with tuna tataki  lived my mini tasting menu,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Came here with a group on a Wednesday night and had no trouble finding a table for 9. Service was prompt and there was a good selection of drinks- plus $5 beers and half price wings all night. They have nice clearly marked dietary options on their menu (veggie, gluten free) and were happy to take care of a celiac friend with us. I had the bacon avocado grilled cheese sandwich, which was perfectly toasted and not too enormous; everyone else enjoyed their meals also. Seems like a great place to stop for drinks or dinner if you're downtown in the evening!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
My coworkers and I went here after work. There was a nacho special and I was craving it. Great price on Thursdays! I also had one of the ciders (I can't remember the name). The food and drinks were great. Next time I'm gonna try the mead!,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Excelente comida y atenci√≥n. El lugar y ambiente muy buenos. Los medallones de cerdo son de los mejores que he probado. Excelentes vinos y postres tambien. Una cena para 2 por $80 no est√° mal en el centro de la ciudad.,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Overall. I found this place to be very underwhelming. Our server, some emo guy, was brutal. He was rude to other people at my table. I get that we came in rather late but he could have treated us the same as if we came at a regular hour. The beers were great. We all enjoyed our beers and undoubtedly they are the best part about the place. I'm not crazy about drinking in a basement, but the room was decent. They didn't have anything on the tvs. The potstickers were tasty. The wings were bland, but that's mostly par for the city. There are better places in the area to go. Woodwork, tres carnales, and craft are better in my opinion. I would try them again if my friends wanted to go again. I would probably go earlier and hopefully get a better server. Overall. Meh. But has potential.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"We were told this was a great place for food and beer and we found that to be quite true. We were lucky and stopped by on wing Wednesday and $5 pint night, so we ate quite well. 

We ordered wings, a hat trick bacon sandwich, and duck confit poutine. All of the food truly impressed us. The nuclear wings were very spicy, but had good flavor. They will have your nose running and eyes watering by the time you are done, but they still have great flavor beyond the spice. The hat trick sandwich was a bacon lovers dream. Bacon patty, bacon jam, bacon, and a fried egg. It was heavenly. The duck confit poutine was the best I have had in Edmonton. 

We also enjoyed a few beers while on $5 pint night. We enjoyed some local favorites, except the ipas. They were drastically lacking in hops as compared to the America ipa's we are used to. The bartender was quite friendly and allowed us to sample beers until we found one we liked. Overall, the food was mind blowing, beer was great, and the service was friendly. I could not ask for much more.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"So Edmonton's latest new tap house, tap and grill place or what you will has finally opened.  While I'm certainly not fond of the ambience, I think that having a good list of beers on tap is a great sign for Edmonton's beer revolution!

Firstly, I was definitely disappointed with the lack of enthusiasm and knowledge of the server.  When you have a one page list of food items and 4 pages of beers, you better well know a bit about beer.   To be honest, I don't blame the server because I actually think she shouldn't be working there.

The plus points are easy: good variety of beers on tap (I believe 72 taps) to give a fair competition to the industrialized MKT.  I haven't eaten there but I'm glad to see that their menu is just one page and focusses on pub fare.  I also like that their beers are listed by 100s, 200s, 300s and 400s, i.e., representing the spectrum of beer drinkers from the newbies to the experts.  However, with some beers not having the name of their brewery listed, it is confusing if not unacceptable.  Also, not sure how many of those beers are craft beers - but I will let the 400s level 'experts' answer that.

The negatives are easy too: top 40s music, ambience Moxie-like, servers who know nothing about beer etc.; all attributes pointing towards the typical Edmonton feel, i.e. treading that line of club and lounge poorly.  The word 'underground' should not be confused with something that is metaphorically underground, i.e., grungy feel, a hidden staircase taking you down (unlike the escalator they have), pub-like ambience, wait staff wearing old clothes from Army and Navy and looking like they really need a haircut but being total geeks about beer, etc.  This is the impression I got from the name, which however, The Underground does not possess. 

Drop in and enjoy a good beer. Don't expect to be wowed.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Met a friend from out of town here for beers last week. Great selection of beers on tap, lots of Alberta craft breweries. It was wing night, so we ordered wings and found them to be nothing special, a tad undercooked and oversauced. 

I found the room itself to be a bit stale and lacking atmosphere. Great location though, and our two servers over the course of the evening were fantastic (I received a beer that was flat and it was exchanged immediately for a different choice). 

All in all an average experience. Good spot to grab a pint or two and move on with you day or night.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Fun environment, excellent service. Our server was well versed on their craft menu and always aimed to please. We visited on tapas night ... chose three (potatoes, satay and poutine) which honestly were hit and miss. I would go again for the beer and service/craft pub ambiance but maybe pass on the food. The flights especially were a great way to experiment with local craft beer experiences.

The drink menu even boasts a selection of mead which is not for everyone, but another idication of the spirited approach The Underground takes to straying from the beaten path.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Went on a Saturday and even though it wasn't busy day us in the back by the bathroom.  Waitress didn't have any helpful beer suggestions for my friend, ended up just suggesting the most popular. Had potential maybe on a different night",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Went here after Beer Fest to get a bite to eat.  We were sat immediately, but waited forever for our drinks, which was a club soda and a water (we were beered out by then).  
Ordered the nachos and calamari - waited almost 25 min for our food.  
Overall impression of this place?  Meh.  Nothing remarkable here.  Food was decent, service not so much.  I do think they're understaffed.  It's like the waitresses didn't have sections or know whose table was whose...
Would I go back?  Probably not - there's a lot of other places that serve decent nachos and calamari, with better service.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've waited until I've been here enough times to give this its rating and I'm happy to give it a 4 star and could very well see it as a five star if things continue to progress they way they are.

Ever since hearing about Underground, I was always hopeful that it would turn out to be my go to craft beer haven. There were lots of delays with them opening but I did turn out on their official opening night to have a few beers. I wasn't over the moon with their beer choices or their beer menu 'levels' but even so, there was still a few beers I'd happily drink.

I've been here a half dozen times since and it's continually gotten better. They've  increased their rotational menu, brought in a lot of interesting beers, and have started to have events. Events such as one off beer events, social media events, comedy nights, and for the Month of February a Dark Beer Festival where they're featuring a large amount of dark beers on their rotational menu.

The food isn't a big draw for me...not great, but decent bar food.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"The Underground has become my go-to central pub for meeting up with friends and big groups. They take reservations, but I've also never had to wait more than a few minutes to get seated just showing up with 8+ people.

I love the beer selection, and that I can pretty much always try something new. They do flights and samplers if you're not sure if you want to order a particular beer. They have daily specials, and while you're not going to find any amazing deals here, it's fairly reasonably priced for a downtown bar.

My only complaint is that the food is just OK. They recently redid their menu, but it didn't seem to help much. It's not bad, I think the menu is just a bit ambitious and nothing seems to be done really well (except that green onion cake sandwich).

But, really, I come here for the beer.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I stopped by The Underground to celebrate a friend's Ph.D. defence. It was a good thing we had something to be happy about, and that The Underground has a good selection of beer, because the food was pretty bad. I took the plunge first by ordering chicken fingers and Caesar salad. The chicken fingers smelled great and tasted almost as good, but the presentation was bizarre--a finger had been propped up in each corner of the square salad bowl. The dipping sauce was bad, just FYI. The small salad bore little resemblance to any other Caesar I had eaten before, as it was entirely devoid of flavour and tasted like thinned-down mayonnaise. In all, I was fairly peeved about spending $12 on 4 chicken fingers and a tiny, crappy salad. 

A friend ordered potstickers, which arrived on a piping hot plate (read: sat underneath a warmer in the kitchen for far too long) and had been charred within an inch of their lives. He gobbled them down because he was starving, but he was none too pleased about it.

The aforementioned beer selection was decent, though I stuck to the cheap ""seasonal"" drafts they were trying to move--mainly because the server made a quip about me being interested only in the $5 beers. And I don't know on what planet Kronenbourg 1664 could be considered a craft beer, even if the brewery is actually old. That said, I'm glad it was there on the cheap beer list. 

The craft beer list appeared to be fairly hops-heavy, with quite a few IPAs and beers with hops in the name, which may have been what dissuaded me from it. They do offer flights, so at least you don't have to commit to an entire pint of something you'll end up not liking.

It was quiet enough to have a conversation, which is a rare find these days. I don't know if that's enough to make me return, though.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Great selection of craft beers on tap,the service is so so. Sometimes they are awesome other times it's brutal. .30cents for a sample that they offer you is bad customer service as well. I have been to Underground a few times but with other craft beer locations available my trips to this place will be less frequent.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Went for brunch last Saturday. Staff ware friendly and the good food is amazing. I had the duck soup which was fantastic. My friend enjoyed the eggs Benedict. The hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy on th inside. Amazing!,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Great selection of beers plus good food.
On busy days, make sure you book a reservation!
I came here with some of my co-workers for supper and drinks on a Wednesday and the place was packed! So glad one of us had reserved a table because there were no empty ones. 
They have 72 rotating taps with new beers tapped every Thursday, with that selection of beers plus spirits, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages I bet anyone will find something to their liking.
They have happy hour Mon-Fri 3-6pm plus Taco Tuesday, Wing Wednesday, Thursday Night Nachos, etc. There is always something to come and try!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Phenomenal pub. Beer selection is incredible, and our lunch was fantastic. But that's not why I decided to write this. The people who work here are personable, knowledgable and genuine. Our server john and christina went above and beyond helping us with the insane beer menu.  There are some good vegan options on the menu making this a place to please all palates. Food was excellent! We will be back soon.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I love trying new drinks and the Underground is definitely a great place to try new beers.  There are 72 beers on tap and featured on their own menu.  All of the beers are sorted by score with a pretty decent description of what you're about to order.  That's one thing I definitely appreciate, as I love trying new beers but don't want to order a pint completely blind, I'd rather know if it's hoppy or not, a porter, etc. As for their food, I've never had an issue with their burgers or mains.  On this past visit there I had their pulled pork nachos ($19) and while they were good and had a great ratio of cheese to nacho, I found it was a little small for my liking - normally nachos are stacked!  The tray was a decent size but there was really only one layer of chips.  Good for sharing with one other person, but I think if we had gone in a group we would have needed more food.

Last night's service was great and our food came out reasonably fast.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy so it's great for date nights or catch up with friends.  I don't come here that often in the summer time as it's located in the basement - I'd rather hit up somewhere where I can drink while enjoying the sunshine :)",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"A really great hidden spot on Jasper Avenue. I've passed here so many times and finally made it in on a Saturday night, when there is a special on beer cocktails ($8) and chef's menu choices ($20). My beer cocktail was a ""root beer"" and it actually tasted like root beer with a kick: a dark beer with Kahlua and root beer schnapps. The chef's plate I chose was a 10-ounce steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Normally this would be closer to $30, but was a bargain for $20. My steak was done to  perfection, tender, and the sides were great too. The atmosphere is casual, service is friendly, and there are a lot of beers, cocktails, and food menu items (mostly higher-end pub choices) from which to choose. I'm looking forward to coming back.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Twin creek tap takeover. I tried Northern Grace Red Rye IPA, Lone Bison IPA, Terraform Porter, Sleight of Hand Porter taps. All winners. Hot chicken wings and Porter BBQ wings were also great. I visited on a wings Wednesday when wings are 1/2 price 5 'Till close. They have a Great food menu for a tap bar. On mondays steak dinners start at $13.95. Expect to be a quite noisy, even for a pub.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Been here four times over the past few years... Tonight will be the last for sure. $100 bill for warm beers and mediocre food at best. Mac and cheese balls are awesome but pricy for what you get. Green onion cake sandwich is bland and not well thought-out; instead of a typical fluffy pancake-style green onion cake, it's a over-deep fried donut-thing that doesn't even resemble a green onion cake... And they sprinkle the green onions on top vs incorporating them. The dipping sauce was kikomans soya sauce and chilli sauce stirred into a bowl. I will say the fries are delicious! We went on a friday and the restauraunt was pretty empty. From what I remember they used to have far more extensive/exotic beer selection.. Now it's mostly domestic (nothing past north america). Music was strange to say the least. They have these weird introgation lights over each table that are so bright you can see your eyebrows all night (get dem tweeezers). Server was fantastic and did everything she could to ensure a great evening. Maybe we caught them on an off night. Hope this helps some people out there. Wouldn't recommend this place for a date night, business meeting, or just a quick meal.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I can't believe I haven't finished my review for Underground.  This is one of my favourite favourite places in downtown Edmonton to visit since they opened. It's a true standby with food, drinks and atmosphere I can enjoy.

Gluten free and vegetarian/vegan options on the menu - those blackened steak tid-bits are really tasty. Now you know which camp I'm in.  

Drinks... I've never had a moment where I didn't find something on the menu I wanted. They have rotating taps for folks who can drink the beer - being celiac, I have fewer options, but there's ALWAYS a cider I like on the drink menu.  Beer flights - my companions regularly partake.

We've had fantastic service, and average service.  Very rarely and nearly never poor or neglectful here - some places you have to beg for a bill these days, and I have not found that here. 

Come early, it gets busy. Check what the current daily specials are. They tweet the lunch specials often, and there are theme nights.  TVs, you can watch multiple sports, and there's art for sale on the walls. Nice they support local folks.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"This place has a great beer selection. We had 2 flights - ie. 4 5 oz glasses of whatever beer you want - just so we could try a bunch, and a lot of them were really good. I think I found a few new favourite beers :) The staff are helpful & knowledgable, and the atmosphere is chill. The food is reasonably good - they change the menu often, so it's rarely the same every time you go :) I'd say that the food varies between 3-4 stars on average, and the drinks 4-5 stars.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Stopped in with a friend after work. Was very impressed. Loved the beer selection and the wings were great. Will definitely be putting this place on my list of places to go.,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"A beer house with staff that is knowledgable! I'm still enjoying the after glow of Rogue Morimoto Soba Ale on tap. The duck poutine was incredible as well. 
Josh, the bartender, provided great service and suggestions, poured me multiple samples and was able to speak about every one of them. This is impressive with 72 taps  with a good portion being rotational. The room is cozy and comfortable. Some music might help. Nothing loud, just ambiance. 
My food came out quickly, mind you it wasn't busy, and it was delicious. Well done  Underground! 
I now count 2 great beer forward bars north of the river with a third coming soon. Step it up south side! There's one good independent, a decent small one with a crap kitchen and a big imposter down south.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've been to this location a few times; for the most part it's decent. I think that they hit the mark on the food most of the time, however, more times than not I leave feeling disappointed by more than one thing. 
The instance I had where I left feeling the worst was a night that I went out with friends, we were given a server that didn't really seem to know exactly what was on the menu, wasn't able to offer any recommendations, told us that they didn't have things that they clearly did have. 
We ordered a cake dessert and when it came out it was so frozen that we were having to stab a knife into it to shave off small chunks of it.
This place is not bad, but I would suggest going in a smaller group and/or asking to be served by someone experienced who works there.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"If I were to make a personalized disappointment scale and list all the worst things that have ever happened to me, the blue cheese and jalapeno burger I had here would rank somewhere between my twenty-fifth birthday party (nobody came and I spent the night shitfaced, playing Team Fortress 2 and losing badly) and finding out my wife was barren.  

They forgot the blue cheese, I think, or else the unfermented, unroasted jalapenos overpowered it like they did everything else.  The meat  itself was an atrocity:  a horrible little mummified disc that cast a choking curse on me as soon as I bit into it.  Unfortunately this happened just as the server came by to ask if everything was all right.  

""NO!"" I tried to call out, but the burger thwarted me by sucking all the moisture from my mouth and wedging itself at the top of my throat.  We engaged in a battle of wills, this burger and I, and just as I was about to succumb I was able to shove it to the side of my mouth and pour enough beer on it to allow me to chew and swallow.  I then covered it with some mediocre fries that I mistakenly dipped in the minuscule ramekin of weirdly sweet ketchup. 

I wish I could tell you I triumphed, but no--this is the first burger I have not been able to finish in my adult life.  It cost me $14, and I can honestly say that it would have been a better use of my money to buy a burger from McDonalds and then pay one of the homeless guys outside ten bucks to punch me in the mouth.

That said, the bun was okay, and the beer selection was very good.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Upon descending down the small escalator to The Underground, I feel a sense of trepidation. What possible atmosphere can the basement of an old building on Jasper avenue have? Will the toilets even flush? How many mice call said building home? Fortunately, there was a light at the end of the tunnel for when you walk into The Underground, the warm woodsy decor makes you forget you are underground! A warm, spacious, inviting mod-pub atmosphere welcomes you.

Though far from a beer aficionado I do appreciate craft beers for the same reason I appreciate art galleries, to enjoy something beyond my comprehension thus stretching myself out of a comfort zone and enhancing my knowledge about a subject. After all, who couldn't use more enhancement? 

I think SD from Oakland has a solid point in highlighting that it might be a little dubious to sell yourself as a craft establishment when a good portion of the selection isn't craft. This being said, relative to this city's environment and market that is my humble home I would say ""beggars cannot be choosers.""

Underground definitely has at least 12 pure local/independent craft selections available for your pleasure. I was lucky to try the Chai Stout from Ambers, Fullmoon from Ally Kat, Pigs Ass Porter from Harvest Moon (Montana) and 606 Pale Ale from Paddock Wood (Sask). Found the Fullmoon and especially the Pig's Ass (which I hope doesn't actually taste like a Pig's Ass because I would begin to question my tastes) great. Learned a lot and had fun getting drunk. Objectives achieved!

The service was stellar. Our server, Lisa, knew her stuff about the craft beers. She did a wonderful job. 

Great place. Hope to come back often.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Have never had a bad dish at this place. Mostly come here for the beer though... Their tap takeover series in 2013 was awesome and the first part of 2014 looks to remain that way. They also bring in so many random hard to find beers... What's not to love about these guys!,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"It was awhile ago that I was here so I'll try my best to remember the details. The Underground is located in I guess what is the basement of the Treasury? It's a super fun time trying to find parking with all of the construction going on downtown and I think that's what played into my 'not loving' this bar. It's a lot of effort for almost nothing. The basement is pretty open with high tops and then some booths around the corner in the back. Apparently there is also a DJ shoved away in the corner, but no one was playing when I was there.

The lighting is horrible - way too bright and sterile for a bar. They have a TON of beer on tap which is great - but as per usual Edmonton standards the servers knew very little about them. Our server also wasn't really that busy, but constantly kept forgetting about us. We only had one drink and left. The prices compared to other places like MKT etc... I didn't try any of the food, but the menu was pretty small and nothing really jumped out at me.

There are plently of other places I would rather spend my time. The only way I see this place being busy would be from the after work crowd since they can just walk over and not worry about parking etc...",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Dropped by and the bartender suggested the lunch special. Chicken Sattay with Coconut rice.... it was FABULOUS!!!!!!! A+++++,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Have tons of great vegan options  and the tapioca was a great vegan option, unfortunately only giving it 3 stars cause the service was totally off, took forever just to get water and dessert and paying was a struggle",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Food, service, seating was all great. I do think it's stingy for restaurants to charge a $1 for a side of sauce...",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've been here a few times.  It's just OK.  I like watching the sports, but around 8:00, they turn off the TV volume and crank up the hits of the 80's. bah
The chipotle steak salad is the best.  The burgers are killer.  Endless beer selection.
We like to sit at the bar.  Bartenders don't always make the best food servers. LOL.  Dude removed my hubby's plate before he was done.  Ooops.  He put it back but since he had touched the fork, hubs requested a clean one to finish his meal.  This caused confusion.  Poor guy got flustered.   
Nothing is ever really wrong here, it's just never great.  
$7.00 pints and up.  Kind if pricey for sitting in a basement.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I went here a couple weeks ago with friends and was just expecting a place to grab a few beers. I was totally impressed with this place. My waitress was new but friendly and the food was AMAZING! Nice variety of not the same exact stuff you find at the other bistro bars. The $5 rotating beer special is awesome, I tried the hogs head brew again and loved it.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've been going here for dinner and drinks with friends on Monday nights for quite some time and it's definitely become my regular pub of choice, due in part to these friends who go here frequently. As a non-drinker (for the most part), I am mostly concerned with the food quality, which is excellent! I adore their food specials for special events such as holidays (the Canada Day specials were delicious for example in 2014, as was the St. Patrick's Day special). The soups are consistently unusual but good. The Monday night steak special with all you can eat sides is a consistent favorite for our group.

My friends really enjoy trying the great drinks from their 72 taps and other drink menu, and I happen to like having a blueberry tea here on occasion, though it's rare to see me drink alcohol. We love the service we get when we come here!

Don't forget to order a yummy dessert if you do eat here: the tapioca dessert is especially good as is the Bailey's Creme Brulee and the Chocolate lava cake.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"As in ""Ferris Buellers Day Off""... OOOoo yyeeaaahh!  This place is a bear drinker's paradise.  72 draft beers! The barkeepers were enthusiast and knowledgeable. The beer, MM MMM M guuud. The atmosphere was easy going and relaxed. I wanted to eat light; more room for beer :)
Whenever I check out a new spot,  I like to keep it simple, and so ordered a Caesar salad. I've found a fresh salad means well kept veg. proper refrigeration etc.  Lettuce was crisp the dressing was authentic; also had a starter of chicken fingers, nice N tasty. Next trip I'll try some real food. I went for the beer :-D
Looking forward to trip #2",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Great pub in the heart of downtown.

Lovely place for larger groups that takes reservations and wonderful service. 

The vegan soup of the day - Sweet Potato Soup - was delicious starter. However, the Polenta Gnocchi was quite flat and nothing special. 

There is a wide beer menu on tap! Lots of options to choose from. 

For meat eaters, my mother adores the Buckin' Bison Burger. 

Excellent spot downtown for a drink or bite to eat.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've been here twice in the past month with friends.  Enjoyed it both times.  The ambiance does remind me of a newly renovated basement bar in someone's house - fresh, but done on a budget.  It's clean, maybe even a bit too bright for a bar, but I don't mind.  Both times, everyone in the group had sandwiches - no major complaints about any of them.  The green onion cake one is a bit hard to each with the chewy cakes, but the flavor is there and good creativity with the concept.

Lots of variety in the beer menu, though putting mainstream beers in there alongside the esoteric ones is a bit cheesy for a boutique drinkery.  Had a flight of the 400 level and a cider.  Couldn't tell you the names of any of them because, well, I was drinking at the time.

The service was good the first time.  The second time it was just so-so.  Most of the attention was being given to a big table across the room and we felt like second class.  Nonetheless, it wasn't enough to put a downer on a nice place to come for a Friday lunch + beers.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"While the atmosphere still reminds me of a windowless Denny's (or a Moxie's, if I'm going to be generous), I'm happy to give the Underground 4 stars. 

On my first visit, while I was impressed with the number of taps in the wall, I wasn't impressed with the space or the service.

But a few months later, with improved service and a great selection of truly rotating taps, I must profess my fandom.

I cannot comment on the food.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"The Underground is amazing! 

Not only do they have an exceptional selection of craft beer but all the servers and bartenders are well-versed in all the beers they serve. 

In addition to the spectacular beer list, the food is a cut above the typical pub fare, including my personal favourite wing night in Edmonton. I've never had a bad meal here! 

While this whole review might come off as being a bit of a fan boy of The Underground, I guarantee it's genuine. There's a lot of places far closer to where I live and work in this city, and the Underground always keeps me coming back.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"We went to the Underground Tap & Grill for the first time on a Saturday evening. We were expecting the place to be packed (Oilers game) but when we got there around 7pm, it wasn't!  Place is nicer than I expected with a very cozy, chilled out bar vibe. I really liked the music - good song selection and best part is that they don't blast it. You can actually have a decent conversation without having to scream and yell. A nice change of pace from the rest of the bars in town.

Anyways, beer wise, they have a great selection. You can pick from their regular menu (100-400 level which is categorized based on intensity/level of flavour). Then they have their rotational menu with quite a selection to choose from. A buddy and I got there early so we had a few beers and drinks before the rest of our friends came to join us. So I'm just writing about what we had:

- Guldenberg ($8) - 12oz beer from their rotational menu. It is 8.5% and from Belgium. I'm no beer expert but it was a blond ale and was well balanced.
- Wee Angry Scotch Ale (300 level) - dark ale that my buddy ordered. 
- Lowrider Double Rye Ale (rotational menu) - I believe this was the other beer he ordered. I can't remember the name for sure but it was a 12oz and it almost had a bit of a wine aroma to it.
 
- Green onion cake sandwich ($13) - a friend that had gone before told me that this was pretty decent. Comes with pulled pork, suey choy, tomatoes and green onions with a green onion cake as the sandwich. They claim it is homemade but I wasn't too impressed with it. I've had better green onion cakes at Asian restaurants. And for the price, definitely would not order it again. For my side, I had the garden salad with lemon honey dressing. Nothing special again.
- BBQ burger ($15) - 8oz beef infused with bbq sauce, cheddar and bacon. My buddy liked it but said he has had much better burgers. He upgraded to get the sweet potato fries.

Basically, good if you want to try beers. Mediocre for food (as you would expect for bar food in Edmonton). Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Just go for a few beers.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I've since been back and, while the food is still the best pub food I've had, and the beers continue to impress, the service had definitely gone down hill. The server we had for our first visit was exceptional. Sadly, this seems to be the exception. In service, knowledge, and personality, every other server I've had has been poor to mediocre. That being said, they have been open less than a month and  have enough going for them to keep me coming while they iron out the kinks!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"The Underground is a bit of a hidden gem; they have a great selection of rotating taps, an extensive beer list, and a pretty decent menu. 

The staff are friendly and well-informed on the beers they carry. Service can be a little slow, but it does give you time to enjoy your beer at leisure. 

Since the influx of craft beer restaurants (Craft, MKT, and Beer Revolution) the Underground has been sort of overlooked. This place is worth a visit, and may become your new hidden gem",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"This is a hidden gem. The staff are amazingly friendly. The Asian pulled pork sweet onion sandwich is quite delicious. Its sweet onion cake is so light and the pulled pork is a definite reccommend. Full of great flavours, sweet, not too much BBQ.  The Bison burger had good flavours. I wouldn't get it again though. For the size of the bun it's on, the burger itself is quite small. Almost doesn't match the quality of a bison burger as you usually associate it as a decent size burger. The chicken fingers with a Caesar salad is a great starter portion or even your meal if you want something on a lighter side. The chicken fingers are so crisp and cooked perfectly!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I need to do diligence to my frequent visits to Underground these last couple of months.  They've certainly impressed me since they first opened (read my first review).  The ambience is better and happier, the beer is good with an extended list of 24 rotational beers - yes, 24 rotational beers!

The menu of regular beers is pretty decent since there are some old favorites that I might want to have on tap instead of buying bottles of - delirium tremens, Three Philosophers and at least a dozen more. 

I'm yet to be impressed by the food though. Got nachos on their nachos night special. We did order it kinda late, around 10:30 p.m., but I found it to lack flavor. The chips were crispy but there wasn't enough fillings on it.  I can excuse that because their beers actually really make them stand out!

The best place for beers in town, without a doubt. There might be the occasional exception, where another bar gets a rare brew, but in general, I feel safe to say that I'll be coming here for my beer indulgences.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I really appreciated being able to sample beer before placing an order.  There's a decent selection, though it definitely leaves behind some faves (though our server told us that they're still open to recommendations and are continuing to change their menu).

As a vegetarian, I found their menu to be frustrating and lacking good selections.  However, the kitchen made me veggie quesadillas that were pretty good - not greasy and full of vegetables.

I think a different kind of seating would help make the place less like a chain restaurant and more like a place to sit, relax, and enjoy lots of different kinds of beer with friends.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Great beer selection but only okay food. I have to disagree with a few other reviewers and say that their sweet potato fries were probably some of the worst I have ever had at a restaurant. The sauce was not what I was expecting and did very little to add to the fries. However, with the number of craft brews on tap and the wonderful service you can't really go wrong by coming to Underground.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Myself and a small group of friends ended up going here over the weekend actually by accident. We needed to find a place nearby where we were and the Underground Tap & Grill was the first sign we saw. Their menu was posted outside beside the door, which I appreciated because I like to know what I'm getting myself into!
We were seated right away, and the hostess, wait staff and manager (as I assumed he was) were all extremely nice. They clearly made an effort to be as friendly as possible which made the atmosphere of the place very enjoyable. 
All of us started with drinks - I ordered the Coconut White Russian which was stronger than anticipated but still very good! I just wish they had ounces on the list before I had ordered it!
We then ordered the nachos which were deceivingly smaller than they appeared, it was actually pretty comical and no one found it to be too big of a deal. It was a pretty generic bowl of nachos - nothing amazing , nothing bad - just your good old fashion kraft cheese nachos.
All of us ended up ordering the Bison Burger for our main meals. Some people asked for cheddar cheese instead of blue cheese which is probably what I should of done as I found the blue cheese a bit too overpowering on the burger. But honestly not horrible - just a little funky.

The highlight however ... and the sole reason I would come back ... is for those sweet potato fries.
Oh my.
You haven't lived until you've had those sweet potato fries. Those alone get a 100/10 - delicious!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"A decent option for a beer and a bite downtown. Great beer selection, good food, and an unpretentious atmosphere are what draw me and my crew here. For a sit down place, the music is a titch too loud for conversation in the evening, but it's not the worst place in the city for that. I've had great, attentive service most of the time. On my last visit, I met a friend for lunch. The waitress was quite slow to take our food orders, and I ended up being late getting back to work. Lunch time servers should always keep that one hour time frame in the backs of their minds. 

The last time I was at Underground I had a bacon avocado grilled cheese and it was freaking delicious - way better than I expected it to be! From now on I think that's all I'll order from here. The time before I had the Jasper Chicken Club which was good, but nothing more. 

Overall a decent spot if you're looking for a more mellow place to spend an evening.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Good was delicious....I had the ramen bowl and couldn't stop. Spicy, high notes of ginger, sweet, loads of pork and a lovely egg. Would come back and order again.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"The staff was super nice here!! The manager (I think her name was Annie) made sure to say hi and a waitress named Mandy served us. She was hilarious; brightened up my afternoon. Very friendly and inviting :) Great selection of beer, I'll be coming again soon for sure",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"After looking around for a place to have a beer and a good meal after a long day we came upon this exquisite place where the food is delicious and the choice of beers is phenomenal!!!

I wish there was a place like this one near home.

The staff is also very friendly and eager to help you choose your kind of beer.

Thanks for a great evening!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"This place definitely has potential. My friend and I decided to come here for a drink before the Oilers game. 
We came down and it has quite the good mix of people  there. From businessmen to construction workers and hipsters. I definitely liked the crowd 
They had quite the selection of beer. I love alley cat beers and they had a rep there giving free samples so I was happy. 
It was steady but not too busy. Our server took a while to get to us but was friendly. I ordered the beer chicken which was on special. It was ok. I liked the sauce that was drizzled on it more than the chicken. I probably wouldn't order it again as it didn't have enough flavor for me. I then ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich which was ok too. The food took a very long time to come out. We were there for a while but I would go back. I did like that they had a good amount of menu options and specials. The portions were ok to.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"...make sure you get the tasters - no refunds.
The last brew I prematurely discarded was a pack of Crow beer purchased outside Rexall before it was Rexall. It survived a couple minutes and a few blocks from the store before being sampled and hurled into an aptly named container in a back alley.
I expected bad, got worse, and still didn't feel ripped off because it's fun to reminisce.

Great selection of unique beers easily compensates for the smaller glasses, $7 'specials' and 'meh' atmosphere. But staff suggesting to 'hold your nose and drink it because you're paying for it anyways' prompted me to get a water and our table of Untappd legends to evacuate before bedtime and abnormally sober. Complementary beer almost anywhere would have me lining up and texting my friends - at the Underground it would have me break even.
This was not the first nor the second disappointment. I want to love this place, but will not bother walking back here.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
Food was good. Enjoyed the variety of options. Beer selection was enjoyed by all. Pulled pork nachos are always great for sharing.,RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Liked the ambience, the food was good. The craft beers were expensive and there were only a couple I really liked. 
Parking was difficult because it's right downtown so be aware. If you like to try a huge variety of craft beers, it's a good place to visit.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"The food is fine for bar food, and beer selection is kind of impressive with big brew and craft breweries, but the service for both my visits has been lacking.

Nothing on the menu really stands out to me aside from the Porchetta Sandwich and whatever the soup of the day is. Fatty pork and strong cheese went together really well with arugula. Its a good, well-toasted if not dry sandwich.

Neither of the waiters/resses seemed to have a high beer IQ, I don't expect conoisseur-type recommendations but with the number of taps here you'd expect them to know what ""hoppy"" or ""malty"" or ""dark"" mean. One occasion, it took 20 minutes to fulfill a beer order per order in a busy but not exactly gigantic place, making it one long night.

The beer menu categorizes its selection by levels and definitely caters to people with more niche tastes which is a nice touch. Ales dominate the menu so premium lager fans won't be happy.

Underground is one of the better places for beer selection in Edmonton but other than that, it doesn't come to mind as a stand out venue - if I were to close my eyes and picture what is at 10004 Jasper Ave, it would be a nice blank spot.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Still my favorite craft beer restaurant, even since the introduction of the many new places in Edmonton. 
The beer selection is phenomenal, with the monthly taps takeovers and constantly rotating 72 beers on tap. I love the food, and have tried almost every menu item, never disappoints!! Very original menu, and great service!!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Was here twice this week.
Once for a work function and another for a birthday dinner.

So one of the pluses of this place is that it is one of the few places that you can make a reservation for a big table for a big group on a Saturday night.

They have many craft beers on tap, with prices ranging from $7-9 (sounds expensive, but don't forget, this is typical for craft beer). I'm a big fan of calamari, however, I found the ones here on the very small and stringy side.  I ordered the bison burger ($15) with side of sweet potato fries ($2), found this to be very good.  Otherwise, food here is typical of most pubs.

Where Tap excels is in the service.  I've never had an issue with it every time I've come here.  Always attentive and checking on how we are doing.

The only down side may be that this isn't a place I'd want to spend my summer days since it's in a basement with no windows.  So with out short summers, I'd rather be sitting on a patio or at worst, somewhere with natural sunlight.  Otherwise, if you don't mind that, this isn't a bad place to go for a craft beer and a bite.  Also don't let the weird smell by the escalator/entrance turn you off, not sure why there's a funky smell there, but it isn't an issue once you're inside.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I really liked this place! I came here Tuesday night with Deanna S. for beer and tapas, and overall had a good experience. The bar itself is much nicer than I expected. From the name I judged it to be a pub on par with Hudson's and the Pint, but it's actually much classier decorated and has a more mature food menu. Our server was awesome, and even indulged our request to move tables when we were first place in a corner booth near the bathrooms. He was attentive and friendly, and offered awesome suggestions for beer. I ordered a flight of 8 (I LOVE that they have flights of beer here! Why try 1 new beer when you can try 4 or 8?) and enjoyed every single one. They have a great selection of different brews from all around the world. The food here was ok. Better than regular pub fare, but nothing extraordinary, and portions are small, especially the tapas that were on special. Even at $3 or $4 a plate, it felt like you weren't getting enough for your money -- I really hope the serving sizes aren't the same when tapas are full price. I had the lasagna for dinner and it was good, but I know I could make the same at home. The atmosphere was laid back, and they have TVs around the room so this might be a decent place to catch a game. During dinner, a VERY drunk patron propositioned me to meet him in the bathroom and then, when I declined and politely asked him and his friend to leave Deanna & I alone, he encouraged me to ""choose a more slimming color"" next time I go out. I was wearing red, so there goes my days representing Yelp, lest I look like a whale =( hahaha. Not one but two of the Underground staff came by to apologize for this jerk's behavior, which I thought was really nice. I give this place 3 stars for food but 5 stars for beer and service. Can't wait to visit again!",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"Friday lunch. Two people. Got seats right away. Had their legendary grilled cheese sandwich (with avocado and bacon) and salad. Order arrived right away. Have been here before, a few times after work hours to try their beer selection, which is also impressive. They run several specials so it is interesting that you can find something new. The interior is classic bar 90s style and the waitresses attentive (they know the menu in other words!). Will definitely come back.",RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA
"I haven't been here for a couple years but they have the best pupusas in the city. Get the mix kind and you can thank me later. The service here can be a bit slow, but I promise the food is worth the wait. Inside d√©cor was kinda bleh back then but I heard they may have renovated more recently.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
Hello. I was there last night with my family.  Fist time we been there.  I order shrimps my wife pork loin.    Chicken tamal and she got the soup.  Now the food I got. The only thing was good was the salad   The rice hace water from the shrimp on the bottom of the plate.  The pork loin she got was hard us rock   I got some plantain banana. Was over ripe. Way over.   I think the food have to be text before go out and. The rice check the rice to. The chicken my daughter got. Was bad taste. She never eat then.   The flan we eat. Was the one on the packet.  That was not good flan   Pls Check the food before go out   Thanks,TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Acajutla is one of my top 5 favourite restaurants in Edmonton. We've been coming here for years, probably once a month. Let me break it down for you:

Decor/Atmosphere: 2 out of 5 stars
Service: 2 out of 5 stars

But the food! 5 out of 5 stars

The decor is fine, but nothing noteworthy. They play fun, well-themed music, and it *is* clean, so that's good.

The service is sporadic. Sometimes it's fine. Other times you have to wait a long time to place your order, or get your drinks, or get your food, or the bill. The servers are not overly friendly, but not unfriendly.

The food though (some of it), it's amazing, and this is why we come so often. Not ALL the food though, only specific items, and I think I have tried almost the entire menu. 

** The number one reason to go to Acajutla is to eat their MIXED PUPUSA **

It's crazy delicious. You top it with the red hot sauce (not very hot), the green avocado sauce (kinda hot), and a heaping pile of the (pickled?) cabbage they bring. It's glorious. Many times we come and that's all we eat. 4 mixed pupusas and that's all you need. Usually we get 2 or 3 mixed pupusas each and share the Mexican enchiladas which are also very good. Other than these two items, the rest of the menu isn't all that exciting to me. Our friends' favourites are the burrito and the mixed plate though, so, you might want to try those.

Go to Acajutla, ignore the decor and the service, eat the mixed pupusas, and you will become a fan.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"The service at this restaurant was good; our server was attentive and friendly. However, the food was terrible. The chili con carne ($17) consisted of a few small chunks of meat, some rice and ""salad"" (lettuce and a few sliced tomatoes). The nachos had been microwaved and tasted stale ($12). After reading the positive reviews, I was excited to give this restaurant a try. I do not intend to return to Acajutla.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Authenticity is the selling point here. The food is fine if you like Mexican and most people do. For me it seems like the sort of place you visit because you are interested in a new experience but then don't return for any particularly great aspect of it. Appeal for a themed restaurant like this lies in the sense of adventure it can give you, unfortunately I don't feel they have entirely succeeded at this. 

Decorations and settings are plain and seemed to lack effort, from this I didn't get the impression that they put all that much better into the sourcing of ingredients or the preparation of the food. There are a few colourful murals on several of the walls that liven the place up and there were colourful hanging pi√±atas when I was there, basically everything you would expect to see in a styled restaurant of this theme. T-shirts were de rigueur.  

Serving staff are pleasant but don't really seem overly engaged in maximizing your enjoyment. They don't help you pronounce the dishes they speak that accent all the time anyway (and no repeating a word twice isn't the same as helping me learn to pronounce it). I could ask about something and get no additional recommendations, further explanation or engagement beyond what is already on the menu. 

Serving sizes are smaller than average and the low prices are a reflection of this. They have a nice selection of Mexican branded soda which you may not have tried. Nothing really stand out on the menu and you may end up ordering taco or a burrito which may not seem entirely adventurous. 

Drop in for a weekday lunch with friends, but maybe avoid taking company you actually want to impress.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
Love this place and always will pupusas we're delicious the beef soup was on point. I never have anything bad to say about this place always good. I'll deff come back many more times in the future.,TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"So I have been going here for over 20 years... my husband took me here when we were dating. Things are consistent. This place hasn't changed anything...d√©cor (although the moved to a different location than originally), menu. They only changed their prices slightly. A really good bang for your buck . I have rarely strayed from what I order (for the last 20 years) the chicken tamal and the combination plate. Delicious.  Filling. Cheap. Authentic. It tasted the same as I did when I was dating my husband. I am sure that the other things on the menu are good, but it is comforting to have something that makes you feel safe and comfortable every time you eat it. There are only two restaurants that we frequent that were buzzing when we were dating - this one and the Than Than. It seems like home. I really recommend if you wat honest, tasty food, try it here. And let me know what else you try...who knows I might order something different next time. Service is slow to be warned so don't come here if you are in a rush.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"After reading a bunch of reviews I decided that this was the place to try. It certainly is not in a glamorous part of the city but some of the best restaurants are on the wrong side of the tracks, so to speak. 
I came here specifically for the Mexican food so the Tortilla soup and Carne Asada was what I ordered. 
I really enjoyed the soup. I'm not sure it was worth 6.99 but it was pretty good. The Carne Asada was pretty bland although it came with some delicious Pico de Galo.  I think something else on the menu may have been a better choice.
I cant say I will ever go back.  The food was ok but not worth a second trip for me.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"OK, I lied.  I decided to give this place another try. In all honesty, I drove by Acajutla to go to another Mexican restaurant but I found that one to be closed. So, last time I came here, the soup was good enough to allow me to convince myself that I may have ordered the wrong entree. Here we go again.

I ordered the Tortilla soup again. It was even better this time. This stuff is delicious. It really isn't worth $6.99 but what bowl of soup can be. I must admit, this is as close to being worth it as you get. It has a little feta, cilantro, avocado, onion and chunks of chicken in a slightly spicy broth.   This is a must for any new customer.  I'm sure it will hook you.

I decided to have the Combonation plate and a side of re-fried beans. The combo had a beef taco, chicken fajita, chicken tostada and a deep fried thing with potatoes and pork in it called a pastel. Kind of like a really big perogy that was deep fried. 
The chicken tostada was delicious. With re-fried beans, chicken, lettuce, cheese and egg it was definitely the best thing on the plate. The crisp taco on the bottom made it almost impossible to eat but the flavor kept me trying.    
The beef taco was chunks of steak and onion on a soft shell. It was good, but plain. I was impressed that it was actual chunks of steak instead of ground beef. I added some Pico de Galo and dipped it in my beans and it made it pretty good. 
The chicken fajita was ok but I could have done with out the pastel. It didn't taste terrible but for as bland as it was, I'm not sure my cholesterol spike was worth it. 
I don't know what the spicy vinegar cabbage is called but it seemed to be ""Mexican cold slaw"" if there is such a thing. It was quite nice.  I enjoyed it so much that I have tried to duplicate it at home, with out any luck I might add. 
The plate didn't come with re fried beans so I ordered a side. They looked like paste, but they were very good. I like the beans to be baked a little and with melted cheese and these were neither. 
All in all, this place was ok. If I'm in the area I will probably try it again.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Long before I moved to E-town I visited and my host brought me to this little restaurant. It was cute, simple and felt very traditional, colourful and festive. They serve up authentic Mexican and Salvadorean food. I had papusas, which are like dough patties filled with ground meat, cheese, shredded cabbage, spices and hot sauce. It may seem a little plain, but it's absolutely delicious, hardy and filling. I used to get them at an El Salvadorean pavilion in Toronto's Kensington market, so this stirred up a bit of nostalgia. These are the kind of places you know about when you wear your home town like an old, worn glove. You find the places that are comfortable and have character. Those little businesses that could because they offer a unique experience amid all of the umbrella owned restaurants that parade as unique, small outfits. If you want to see what Mexico or El Salvador is like before you make the trip, come here and find out what the people and culture off-the-resort can offer.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"A comfortable place. Family-friendly. Authentic cuisine. 

Affordable. Polite staff.  There to explain everything on the menu for those unfamiliar with El Salvadoran food.  

Options for people who do not eat spicy food and those who do.  

 Highly recommend the Pupusas.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"My all time favorite dish to order here are the pupusas!! I love the cheese pupusas. You can also order pupusas with a combination of cheese, bean and pork inside. The interesting part is that it doesn't cost extra to have all three ingredients. 

The tortilla soup is so yummy!! The chicken broth is warm and comforting. The soup is served with shredded corn tortilla chips on top. I like the extra bit of crunch mixed with the pieces of chicken, avocado and feta cheese. Sooo good!

Definitely come here for authentic Mexican and Salvadoran food! The food is great and the prices are reasonable. Usually the service is pretty quick here. They can get busy during peak hours, but the food is worth the wait!",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"I took a Spanish class in school, so I had this menu down pat. Yes, I love mexican food and Acajutla appeared to bring that with a El Salvadorean influence to the menu as well.

It was decently busy but snared a reservation pretty quickly.

I take pride in my ability to eat anything whether I like it or not and I struggled with that on this day.

The first course was the beef soup. It tasted good but they ran out of tripe earlier in the day and replaced it with more beef tendon. One issue with this dish; is that it smelled terrible enough I couldn't finish.

We ordered: ceviche, pupusas, tamales, enchiladas, carne asada steak and sausages.

Ceviche was refreshing but I should've asked what kind of fish it was because it had an oiliness to it.

Pupusas came with an awesome cabbage slaw. We got the mixed plate and they were great little pockets of meat and cheese. Definitely worth a try.

Tamales and Enchiladas were forgettable. Both were painfully dry and the enchiladas were probably the worst I've ever had.

The steak was requested medium and it definitely probably was medium but you probably couldn't tell because it was just gristle. The sausage were nice and earthy but small. The beans and rice were definitely something I could stand behind.

At Acajutla, I failed to find anything that stood out despite suggestions from friends and the waitress but I will definitely give it another shot because there were things on the menu that I wanted to explore.

The decor and lighting was plain in a run down way but the flourishes of color around the dining room gave it a distinct South American feel.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"I can't say that I am a mexican food expert. I've been to Mexico, I've eaten Taco Bell, that's about it for me. But I started going to Acaljutla at the request of an old friend, and I really fell in love with it. I fell in love with it even more when I took a new friend (who moved here from Mexico) to it and she couldn't get over how much it was ""like home."" 

The place is in a shifty part of the city, on 107th Ave. I've witnessed more than a few homeless guys getting tossed into the police van while sitting there, eating my dinner. But when it comes to food, I'm one who goes for more of a tasting-experience over all else, so I remain undeterred.

The restaurant is a shabby little place with colorful decorations tacked up all over the walls. It is family owned and while the service isn't exactly bursting with cheerfulness, they are efficient and know what they're doing. The food is cheaply priced but wonderful and authentic. The menu is rather large and there are lots of new things to try. When you walk in and get settled, you kind of feel like you're eating in someone's home. That kind of care and love for the food goes into your meal.

If you are seeking an authentic, different meal with no frills and satisfaction, definitely try out Acaljutla. Definitely great for the long winter months when all you need is a little vacation - if you can't go to Mexico, bring Mexico to you!",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because of the food, if it were for service it would be a -1 star.   The waitresses don't give a damn about the customers, its incredibly evident.  They are slow to serve you and not at all friendly.
However, the food is superb.  the pupusas were out of this world amazing, especially with the cabbage slaw and avocado cream you put on them
I would rather get take out then dine in because of the haughty attitudes.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"6 years later and I am still in love with the mixed papusas here.  ALWAYS ask for the  green sauce and extra cabbage.  There is never enough cabbage.

Prices have gone up slightly over the years but that's to be expected.

We've tried most of the menu and really it's just the papusas that keep us coming back for more :-)

Be warned - the wait for papusas on a busy day can seem like an eternity.  But they are worth it!",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"For my first time at acajutla I am very impressed with the quality of the food. I tried the tortilla soup (a bit over priced in my mind) but very tasty, and the Mexican enchilada, the chicken was cooked to perfection and I really like the cheese factor. I gave four stars as an all around experience, the service was good and the decor reminded me of my only trip to Mexico. I'll def. go back again very soon!",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Came here during vacation, outside of El Salvador, these pupusas are among the best I've had. The pupusas are gluten free, The green Salsa adds a nice quick of spice to the curtido and house salsa. The price is quite reasonable and the cute Salvadorian girl was extremely helpful. #imaddicted can't wait to be back and refresh my pallet",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Came here with the fam jam last week after a day of errands. 

We've been coming here, specifically for mixed papusas, for 15 years now. 

I have to say either our taste buds have changed or the papusas are different.  They somehow don't excite us as much here anymore.  There are a few other changes - the pickled cabbage slaw that comes with the papusas now comes in a small jar (despite our order of 6) and extra is an additional charge. 

The kiddos liked the nachos and tacos best. 

We still love El Salvadorian but somehow the other options in town are now calling my name louder.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"A co-worker recommended this place to me as a great place to try for tasty mexican food. I'm glad I went, the restaurant is not in the best neighbourhood in the city, but they do have free parking in the back. From outside it even might look a bit sketchy, inside you will hear latin or mexican music playing, they recently in the last couple of year spruced up the place a bit (new paint, carpet, wall decor). I usually order the chicken Flaatas and Enchiladas with a nice big strawberry Margarita - I am literally addicted to all 3. I found their food very tasty and there was no skimping on the ingredients especially the cheese. The service isn't the quickest, but if they are making my meal from scratch I do not mind waiting for the fresh food. The server didn't seem to warm up to us at first, but after a few visits and some friendly chats that went away. So in summary if you are looking for a tasty, fresh mexican meal that you may end up craving for in the future and are not expecting the ritz this would be a great place to out on your list to try in the future.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Food was good. Recommend papusa. Burrito was really good too. Margarita was really way too sweet - would not recommend. The server was not friendly nor professional, that's why I had to only give two stars. Sadly, I think I would want to try other restaurants before coming back.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Warm, nicely decorated restaurant with an authentic El Salvadoran ambience.  I went there with my girlfriend and her little boy on a Sunday afternoon (they open at noon on Sundays).  After ordering, we waited quite a long time for our food to come out---more than half an hour (!), but the food was good.  I ordered pork pupusas, corn tamale filled with chicken, and plantain with sour cream.   For drink, I ordered a glass of Horchata.   In addition to the long wait time, I thought the plantain with sour cream was way overpriced.  The dish was just one plantain, simply pan-fried and sliced with nothing added, and served with sour cream.  $7.00?  If I had known the dish was going to be so small, I wouldn't have ordered it.  For seven dollars, I could have ordered two more tamales instead.   Comparing this restaurant to Mamenche's, which I went to a few weeks ago, I prefer Mamenche.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"While the food offered by Acajutla is good in my estimation, it is about 30-40% more expensive than it should be.  The service can be spotty as noted (one of the gals working there seems to be more interested in using her smartphone than waiting upon and bussing the tables), but the occasionally indifferent service and the wait are worth it for a once-in-awhile treat.  If you like chichi decor, then don't come here.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Fresh, healthy ingredients. The food tastes good. It just feels better to eat at a clean, family run place like this.

Reasonable prices. The margarita was tasty too.

Will definitely go back.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"it tastes great, I am mexican and i can tell u this place its 100 % authentic, the portions arent huge, but everything tastes great, mm i want a pupusa right now lol really try it this is real mexican food, not like taco bell (thats crap n shouldnt be called mexican) i love also their tacos either the beef tacos or chorizo ones simple an tasty with the freshly made corn tortilla and cilantro n onios , fresh lime n salsa u cant go wrong",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"The last time I went is the last time I'll go

Waited for 45 minutes at my table and never got served. Can't comment on the food because I never got any.

 To be fair, I enjoyed them in the past when they were on 97 St.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"I want to preface this review by saying I have zero tolerance for spicy food... standard hot wings from a pub are usually too much for me... it's pretty pathetic actually. And when I eat spicy food, I get hot and sweaty and generally unpleasant. 

With that out of the way, I'll get to my experience. The restaurant is very bright, vibrant and welcoming. I wouldn't say the food was slow to come out, but being a small kitchen it takes a little longer than your average chain restaurant and I'm perfectly fine with that. 

Our server was nice and attentive and helped me decide on a dish. I went with the Chicken Escabeche, which was three chicken thighs with peppers and onions and  chimol on the side, which is kind of a salsa/salad with tomatoes, green peppers, jalapenos and cilantro. Our server asked if I wanted the chicken spicy or medium and because of my aforementioned weakness for anything that is spicy, I didn't hesitate in choosing the medium option.

Thankfully, the chicken wasn't overly spicy. It warmed me up a little bit, like a hot toddy after a long day of snowboarding, but nothing to complain about. Then I tried the chimol -- an innocent looking mix that was anything but. It was a raging inferno disguised as a cute little salad. After a large bite, my eyes started to water, my sinuses instantly cleared up and I started sweating... I actually wanted to go home and shower. Now mind you, my wife and friend, who both have much higher tolerances to spicy food, didn't have these same symptoms, but did say that is was probably too hot for them to enjoy. And I understand that since Acajutla is known for being very authentic, this is probably the way this dish is meant to be served, so that's cool. But it was way too much for my unaccustomed tastes.

We also had three pupusas - bean, pork and mixed. They were all pretty tasty and I would recommend them as a small appetizer. 

Overall, the experience was great. If my mouth and lips didn't feel like a flaming upside down police car on streets of Vancouver after a Game 7 Stanley Cup Final loss, I probably would have given it a five.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"This place is family run, provides great service, is clean, and the price is right! I can't believe it's taken me so long to finally eat here! Best experience at an authentic Latin American restaurant so far in Edmonton!!!

Get the pupusas!!! You can get any mix of pork, bean, and/or cheese. My personal favorites are pork&cheese and pork&cheese&beans but just cheese is a classic. I love that you get a whole jar of the cabbage slaw and a squeeze bottle of the red vinegar sauce. They'd give you more if you want too. I like it with their hot sauce. This hot sauce has some serious heat to it so use it sparingly unless you like the burn! It goes well with the cheese pupusa cuz the dairy offsets the heat. 

I also really like the tamales. The chicken is probably the most popular but there's a corn one that is sweet enough to be a dessert. Worth trying for sure. 

I'm a really big fan of Acajutla. The family that owns and manages the restaurant is friendly, accomodating, and makes authentic Latin cuisine. The service is timely and professional while warm and inviting. Acajutla is my new standard in Edmonton... Long may their reign!",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"So I have been going here for 20 years, however for the last 10 I have maybe visited once? Not sure why...maybe because there is more competition with other restaurants....maybe we broadened our food horizons....but I was feeling nostalgic so we went there last weekend after a 8 year hiatus. And you know what...everything was just how I remembered it. Place looks the same...fun colorful with lots of things hanging, and zippy music playing in the background. Menu was the same, and even the sides are the same. I ordered what I always order. Started with an order of mixed papusas and then the combination plate - Tostada, deep fried pastel, taco and fajita. I love the pastel with hot sauce and cabbage. It is my favourite thing on the menu here. The flavour combination can't be beat.  I know I should try other things on the menu, but I can't bring myself to. Papusas amazing...love the cheese one. My husband loves the meat one. And the pastel is sooo delicious. Nothing fancy...nothing pretentious..but everything is delicious. It will not be another 8 years returning.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Finally got to try this place out yesterday for lunch with my mom and we both loved it! After Latinos shut down we thought we should give the restaurant a try and I'm so glad we did. 
Around 2:00pm on a Friday we were the only ones there so it doesn't seem too busy. Theyre on skip the dishes I believe so I'm assuming most of their costumers are through that. The waitress was attentive and helped us out with choices. We started with chicken flautas which were a perfect appetizer size for two. Crispy, warm - just really quite good. 
I ended up ordering the beef soup and my mom ordered their tacos. The soup was awesome and I would definitely recommend it. I'm never one to get soup at a restaurant but it fills you up and tastes like something from home - it actually reminded me of a Croatian stew. 
Afterwards we tried the horchatas and their fried plantains. The horchatas were different than any others I've had - they were far less sweet and thick but really good regardless. 
The fried plantains, also different from some I've had was also just as good and had me scraping at anything left in the bowl. 
Overall good experience and great authentic salvadorian/mexican food!",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"I have been a regular at this restaurant since the beginning. I actually started going when they were on 97th St and 108 Ave, so obviously I really like this place. But lately something has changed that has really irritated me. They have become more and more expensive relative to other restaurants. For instance there tacos. They are delicious for sure, but you only get three little ones for $11.00 while you can go to Tres Carnales and get 4 amazing tacos for $10. And no offence but the atmosphere at Tres Carnales is substantially better than Acajutla. Also annoying is the new practice of portioning out how much curtido (or the cabbage) you can have with your papusas. They use to bring out a nice big jar when you ordered more than 5 or 6, now they bring you exactly what they feel is enough for you. We had a group of 3 order 5 papusas and they brought out a tiny little jar of cabbage. This was enough for 2 papusas tops. When we asked for more we were charged an extra $4.50 on our bill for another little jar. I find this ridiculous for cabbage! If you ask for the tasty green sauce that they use to always provide complimentary, they charge you extra for that as well. There papusas are still the best in town but at $3.75 each, they are not a great cheap meal out anymore. By the time they charge you for the extra cabbage and green sauce your spending $20 for a plate of papusas! These things go for 50 cents each in El Salvador and Honduras. We have a lot of Latin friends who refuse to come here because they can't believe the prices. 
We use to come weekly to Acajutla but we won't anymore as I hate being nickel and dimed for everything in a run down unappealing restaurant in not the greatest part of town. The food is still good but the changes have annoyed me enough to move elsewhere like El Rancho for papusas and Tres Carnales for tacos.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Very disgusted from this place. Ordered a beef soup(menudo) and a burrito because from my last visit I knew that the soup was more of an appetizer than a serving of food. The soup had black skin with hairs on it which is not typical of menudo, I would know coming from Florida and being very familiar with Hispanic cooking. As the for the burrito, I was just about finished with it and when I cut the last bit up...I noticed a thick, long hair in it. 
I notified the waitress, and all she had to say was ""do you want something else?"" Why would I want something else? To get MORE hair? No. 
We paid $55 for the food - did not discount the price. Waitress said that the cook says she ""thinks"" it was a hair from corn stalk. My wife asked her how does beef, or beans get near corn stalks?? No answer for that.  
We told them we would report this. They acted all nonchalant, and said ok. 
So they'll be reported and we also won't be visiting here again.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"I've been coming here once or twice a month for somewhere between 10 and 20 years, and it hasn't changed too much. The pupusas are still delicious, as is everything else I've tried on the menu. I mostly order pupusas and the huevos rancheros, but you can't go wrong with any of the dishes at this place.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Some of Edmonton's tastiest bites hail from random tiny, divey, ethnic abodes scattered all around (and outside of ) the inner city. Acajutla is a homey family-run restaurant offering delicious Latin cuisine. The tortilla chicken soup was delicious and comforting as if it gave me a hug. And the lengua tacos were very tender and well-seasoned however the ceviche was the best dish that I enjoyed.  If you're looking for a nice and cozy place with unpretentious service and incredible food, Acajutla hits the spot.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Excellent food! Everything is so fresh and hot when it comes out, we have always left happy. High quality ingredients with average portion sizes. Definitely a place to take note of! Service can sometimes be a little off, but food is 5/5.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Appearances can be deceiving. The restaurant decor is something from small town Saskatchewan cafe design - but the service makes up with happiness and friendliness. Our waitress was serving everyone in this cafe, and she was still happy go lucky. That sort of server is a rarity in Edmonton!
A great place for Latin American cuisine. 
It appears that they 'tone down the intensity' of their dishes for 'white people""? The side dishes are bland, BUT the Pupusa's (?) & cabbage slaw are execellent. Remind the server that you can take the spice - and it will all work out for the best. We wouldnt drive across town for a meal, but  a good choice if you are in the neighborhood.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA

"Went here for lunch with 2 friends recently with high expectations after reading the good reviews. The service was completely terrible!

The place was on the crowded side when we arrived, but most of the tables seemed to be finishing up and it mostly cleared out within a few minutes of us being seated. Nonetheless, no one acknowledged us for at least 30 minutes after we were seated, despite numerous attempts to make eye contact. We eventually managed to flag someone down and told her that we wanted to order, but it wasn't until several minutes later as we were getting up to leave in disgust that someone finally came to take our order.
When our food finally arrived it was alright, but definitely not worth the  wait!",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA

"I heard mix reviews about this place, and one day I got the chance to check it out.  It's a family own restaurant, and when I got to the door, the place didn't really stood out to me.  The decor was very simple and it seems that they didn't put too much effort in it.  It looks simple and outdated, my water was serve in a plastic glass that you'll find in a school cafeteria, the plating and the presentation of the food looked effortless.  Now the food on the other hand, very authentic, fresh, and flavorful.  Being a Salvadorian own restaurant, I also tried the tacos, and they were also very tasteful.  My only complain about the this place was the atmosphere, the decor and how uninviting the setting looks inside as soon as you step in.  I'm not surprise that this restaurant got good reviews, being one of the few Spanish/Latin restaurants in the city to compare to.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"I visited this place with a Salvadorian friend. Its a simple family owned diner...wouldnt really call it a restaurant. The food itself is amazing!

I had the tamarindo to drink. I havent had the taste of real tamarind in years! The other drink options although I cant remember the names were good. Tropical punch style drinks...non-alcoholic though!

I had a pupusa which is like a stuffed pita pocket with pork, beans and veggies. Also had a tamale which is stuff corn bread kinda mix steam cooked while wrapped in a banana leaf. Both were excellent. A bit pricey I thought but they both are labourious to make from what I heard. 

For mains I had the combination platter as some other did on this forum. The spicy homemade sausages were really good. Overall, it was a fantastic experience.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"AUTHENTIC!!! I have been coming here for YEARS with my very good friend. We always get the pupusas revueltas (mix pupusas). This time we went, the prices had gone up, $4 per pupusa (mixed ones). However I still feel they are a good deal for the price. We always ask for the avocado sauce as well to add on. And the Horchata is a bit sweet but delicious! 

They were cleaning constantly while we were there which is very comforting as they have a lot of pick up orders. The service is friendly and they make everything fresh so it may take a bit longer than most places.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Being located in the not so glamorous part of our city, Acajutla is a restaurant worth visiting. Both times I visited Acajutla, I had a dining companion as I wouldn't risk visiting the area where this restaurant is located alone. Acajutla serves Mexican and Salvadorian cuisine which is definitely a huge step beyond Taco Bell and Taco Del Mar. The food is authentic and flavorful.  The restaurant itself is small, with rather simple yet festive d√©cor. The menu isn't very long but sufficient enough. I have tried Chicken Escabeche which consists of marinated chicken thighs served with bell and jalapeno peppers, onions, refried beans and tortillas; and a combination plate which has pastel, taco, fajita and tostada all topped with salsa and cabbage salad. To say that these meals were good would be oversimplifying it! They were savory and fulfilling yet didn't make my stomach feel heavy as sometimes happens when I eat Mexican food. 
Acajutla is a cozy restaurant that feels homey. Chefs put their hearts into the food they prepare. And these two facts result in a pleasant dining experience for those of us who decide to come to Acajutla.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"After driving past this place numerous times (and recently developing a fixation with all things Spanish), I finally decided to give it a go. 

My friend and I went on a Friday night. I got there a few minutes earlier, and was immediately greeted by a friendly, French-accented waitress. The interior had that quaint and cozy atmosphere typical of family-run restaurants, and was tastefully decorated with a few Mexican-Salvadorean-themed decorations, and a painting on the back wall.

There was only one other table, occupied by a large family. I asked what she recommended to drink, and they do have some interesting looking fruit-based drinks. The one she recommended included peanuts and milk, which I will probably try next time. I settled on a pineapple margarita. It was tasty, but pretty typical- identical to what I've had at Julio's Barrio.

My co-diner and I started with the chicken tamales. Neither one of us had any idea what to expect. They arrived wrapped in a leaf, appearing to have been steamed- and consisted of very soft dough, holding a small piece of mildly spiced chicken and a piece of green pepper. I was hoping for more spice, and doused it in hot sauce to compensate.

Next, I had a mixed pupusa, which was pretty satisfactory- especially when topped with the cabbage slaw and yet more hot sauce! My co-diner was dissatisfied with the lack of veggies in his quesadillas. I felt the same way. The food was filling, but rather boring.

3 Stars for the service and d√©cor- 1 star for the food. If you're looking for spicy, exciting Latin/Spanish flavors, check out El Rancho on 118th Avenue.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"Chorizo Tacos, Ceviche and Pupusas

Continuing with one of my all time favorite foods, tacos, we went to Acajutla. This restaurant boasts El Salvadorian and Mexican cuisine and overall does it alright. Tacos came in 3, served on corn tortillas with onions, cilantro and avocado. I had the chorizo (that is typically never moist), had some kick to it but the rest of the ingredients like the veggies were so-so. Ceviche had diced tilapia, in lime juice and chimol had a pretty decent tase. Definitely tasted better than the tacos for sure. Main reason we came here though were the pupusas. Traditional Salvadoran pupusas made with corn flour and stuffed with cheese and pork. I thought the flavor was ok, but wish there were more filling. There might be some standard value for the tacos here, but the pupusas being 4 bucks each is kinda pushing it. Also running out of chicken was kind of weird. Friday night seems like a primetime to have chicken y'know?

Located on 107th ave and 113st, this small restaurant has some charm. Although the service was lacking as I had to get up from my seat to get someone's attention, place was a decent enough place to try if you're in the neighborhood. 

Sal says: Just Try It (3/5)
Jen says: Pupusas are tasty and very satisfying. Mixing cheese, beans, and pork are the way to go. Ceviche is light and fresh. Running out of chicken was odd.
Bal says: It's a cute little restaurant. I love the pupusas. I really enjoyed the Chile con carne dish as well.",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA
"PAPUSAS!  Need I say more?  My husband and I come here just for their mixed papusas - (my feeble attempt to describe) a corn like tortilla stuffed with cheese, beans, and mixed meat (pork and chicken I think) with a variety of hot sauces and sweet and salty cabbage served on top.  An El Salvadorian staple and Acajutla's does it right!  

We have tried several entrees there but nothing is as delicious as the papusas so we usually just order a platter of 6 or 7 to share and we are happy as clams!

Be advised the wait can be awhile and if you want a large order of papusas for a large group, it's best to call ahead and let them know.  They make everything from scratch to order so be prepared to wait... oh so worth it!  Have a nice margarita while you wait...",TTUsGHhMch_hW03be2H0oA

"Villa Bistro is the new restaurant where the Free Press Bistro used to be, and I loved it!!!

The service was great - friendly and fast. We grabbed a seat on the patio for lunch on Saturday. The prices are a little expensive, but I found the value to be totally worth the money.

We ordered the Salmon salad and a pulled pork sandwich with fries and shared both. The salmon salad I was especially leery of because it was 20$ (yikes!), but it looked delicious, and we were splitting, so I gave it a try. And boy am I glad I did! They split it for us and it was a large portion, absolutely worth 10$. With roasted yams and brussel sprouts and a champagne vinagrette...I can't wait to eat it again!!

Like I said, we also split the pulled pork sandwich with fries, which was 17$. The pulled pork was a little bit spicy, with a nice creamy slaw on top. It was great. 

Although a little expensive, I feel like the prices are in line with delicious, downtown food. Overall, I loved it and will be going back often.",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw

"I went to check out Villa Bistro a couple weeks back with a couple coworkers! It is tucked away on the end of 104st that I rarely venture, but definitely is worth a visit. They do have a patio for those nice summer or spring days, as well as ample seating. I believe this previously was the location of a sandwich/soup joint a few years back, as I recall catching up with a friend here once!

The cafe is modern and quite quiet so it makes for the perfect ambience to catch up with a friend or have lunch (or dinner) meeting or even a small getogether! 

They do also have different specials throughout the week! We happened to stop in on a Thursday when they have $15 pasta specials! My co-workers both ordered the seafood linguine filled with salmon, scallops, and prawns and came with a slice of garlic bread on the side and looked delicious. The portion size was decent. I opted for the 2 piece fish and chips because I was in that kind of mood that day. It was served with fries and coleslaw that kind of was more saladesque but still delicious nonetheless. The leafy greens were fresh and crunchy and the dressing was just right! The fish was super flaky and served with some tartar sauce on the side.

Service was quite speedy and attentive despite there only being one waitress that day! Perfect, when you only have an hour long lunch break! The next time you need a quiet place to catch up with a friend Villa Bistro definitely is worth being a contender!",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw

"Quaint corner bistro on 104 street located around the corner from the Holiday Express Inn in the heart of downtown Edmonton.

Today was a bitterly cold day with extreme wind chills so the desire to wander far for lunch was non existant. I turned down 104 street and literally stumbled on this corner bistro.

I was in the hot pursuit for comfort food.

A toasty sandwich and a hot  bowl of soup. 

I must have timed it right before the lunch rush as it was just me.

I am writing this as the rich aroma from the cream of mushroom soup tickles my nose.

A new spin on a classic Grilled Cheese Sandwich and my taste buds have found happiness. Like a warm blanket on a cold Saturday morning.

"Checked out this place because it was part of the Downtown Harvest Dining event taken place in Edmonton. I wanted to check it out because it is a fairly newish restaurant, with not too much fanfare attached to it. It was pleasant enough in the inside. It had rather warm interior. One thing I didn't like was that there are not any interior bathrooms rather you need to remember a code and take it to hallway. This is not convenient but not completely a deal breaker. Our server was pleasant enough and left us with menus even though we were ordering off of a special menu. Glancing at the menu it had nothing standoutish but a good selection of burgers, sandwiches,  appetizers, and main entrees. We ordered a squash soup as well as a  cream of mushroom. I had the Cajun salmon  while my husband chose the  braised short rib. I have to say, the food was amazing. Possibly one of the best cream of mushroom soups I have tried, my own butternut squash soup was rich and warming. My trout was perfectly cooked, the generous portion was plated on top of fried mushroom quinoa and perfectly cooked asparagus. I loved how they prepared the quinoa, the frying gave an additional crunch. My husband's short ribs were flake off the fork tender. Definitively worth trying out.",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
"I popped into Villa Bistro because I was waiting for the Red Arrow bus and it was hot out and there were people on the patio and they had a Happy Hour and I was thiiiiiirs-tay.  Man am I ever glad I did.  This place is GREAT and I haven't even eaten there yet!

I sat at the bar and chit chatted with owner and drank my $4 Happy Hour pint and it was an absolute treat.  I'm 5 starring this place based on the d√©cor, the location and the lovely people that run it.  Just by watching how much care went into the cocktails that were being made and the care going into polishing glasses while serving and having a sincere convo with me, I can tell this place is a total lucky find on my part.

I HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED THE FOOD YET YOU GUYS.  But boy-oh-boy I watched the dishes coming out of the kitchen and everything looked spectacular.  There's not a doubt in my mind that everything isn't as delicious as it looks. I've been away at work for 3 weeks and legit my first stop when I get home is to hit Villa Bistro.  They advertise a $30 3-course date night on Saturday nights: appy, main and dessert plus $2 off cocktails and I'll be hitting that up ASAP.",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
"Hidden gem.  Tucked away south of Jasper Ave on 104s St, this place deserves more evening traffic than it gets. We booked a table for 2 on a cold Friday night in January, and when we arrived there was only 1 other group of customers in the place. Menu has the usual Bistro things like burgers, sandwiches, salads and a good selection of dinner type things like pasta, short rib, and salmon.  
I chose the Loaded Villa Burger and it was absolutely delicious.  Thick handmade patty that was juicy and flavourful, fresh toppings and lovely flavourful sauces like aioli and a couple slices of glazed bacon. It was, possibly, one of the best burgers I've had in Edmonton.  I chose the truffle fries as my side and they were also full of flavour and delicious.  
Service was also excellent, really friendly, knew the menu and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was a good one. 
Beer menu was ok, but only had 1 local beer option. Edmonton's beer scene is getting to be very good, it would nice to see more restaurants support them instead of the big brand stuff.

"I hate that I have to dole out a 1 on a place but this is what it is. Joint was exceptionally bad from the get go...

On the ruins of what was Nello's/Il Pasticchio/Nello's lays the newest Italian reincarnation of the iconic spot on the corner of 116st and 100ave...this place has a special spot in my heart, my grandmother used to love this spot back in the day and we celebrated a few bday dinners years ago..unfortunately it's fallen on hard times.

We walk into an empty room basically, and after having a laugh at getting propositioned for oral pleasure by a homeless person in the bathroom (albeit a public bathroom) I was certainly hoping for a good meal...my bad.

We started with some lamb lollipops with a chimichurri which looked absolutely incredible but fell majorly flat. Just under seasoned and bland. Well cooked temperature wise but just blah. The Chimi was super oily and didn't have much flavour at all...not a good start ,Fingers crossed for the mains

I ordered the braised short rib, which I'm gonna order pretty much every time I see one on a menu...unfortunately they didn't have any ready, we were told it would be ready in an hour or so...this was at 630..on a Friday night...cause why would you have that ready? Not sure who is running the kitchen but you'd better be able to produce items from the menu at 630 on a Friday night especially when there's 2 table in your restaurant...so I settled for a lobster gnocchi while my GF decided on the half chicken with fried brussel sprouts and mash. I've never had more dense gummy gnocchi in my life. Instead of light and fluffy it was a little like eating chunks of dry wall paste. The lobster was ok, pretty over cooked but not terrible. The GF had thee most over cooked dry chicken one could possibly imagine, to the point where she couldn't even come close to finishing it. The mash was just blah and the gravy was congealed and disgusting. Huge props on the brussel sprouts tho, they were delicious! 

So a couple pointers...after we finished our lamb lollipops we had used our utensils...they were placed neatly on our side plates. Instead of taking them and bringing new ones we were instructed to just keep them and put them on the table while she got us some new napkins...just pony up the 2 new roll ups ok. Like seriously there's 6 people in the whole place I think it could be done. The napkins are another thing. They were literally the cheapest things ever, like the ones you pull outta the tin dispenser on your table at a Burger Baron. If you're gonna try to put on the facade of fine Italian dining (even in these extraordinary times) pony up for a real napkin please. Not even cloth, just more than one ply please. If you're gonna serve chicken (dry or not) and lamb maybe a steak knife of some kind? Dull bread knives aren't gonna (literally) cut it. 

We ducked out before having to endure dessert...

Our server was lovely, and was trying her best but clearly was under trained and not very knowledgeable. I really wanted to like this place but it needs some serious work or this will be another restaurant on the garbage pile of CoVid 19. I hope this stuff can be fixed and would actually like to give it a try when they get back in shape 

Cheers 

Andy",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
"Had a bad feeling about this call. Ord√©red pick up for 8:45 at 6:30. Then tried to order the short rib with risotto. No short rib, tried to order the filet of beef, told the only had a filet of fish, they could order me a tenderloin of beef...whatever. I ordered risotto instead of potato..

Beef came cooked right, but with potatoes not risotto and served as if made at 6:30 for 8:45 pickup.

Dessert a Dixie cup of icecream, a slab of brownie with 2 tiny slices of poached pear.

Underwhelming.",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
"If you plan to dine al fresco, be aware that a Red Arrow bus depot is next door and is busy with at least one idling bus at the supper hour. I had the Sea Food Linguini, which was no big deal. The shrimp were over cooked. They no longer had the Chocolate Mousse and were out of Pecan Pie, so I settled for the strawberry cheesecake which is also not memorable. There might be great items on the menu, but I don't think I'll be back to try find out. The service, however, was fine.",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
"Absolutely delicious!!! This restaurant has been recently renovated and looks so fresh! It's the perfect place for some delicious bites and great wine to go with it. Friendly, attentive service, very clean and tables are socially distanced already. They have a great patio for those warmer lunch times. 

I had the lamb popsicles, they were so good! Must be eaten hot so eat these first! Then I had the calamari and, WOW! These calamari are one of my favourites so far. They have a Portuguese flair with olives and tomatoes, delicious.  And to finish I tried the fries which were light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside! Definitely recommend this place if you're downtown and want some Portuguese inspired cuisine.",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
Excellent food and great customer service at Villa. Had a great time with friends and felt the Decore and atmosphere was very appropriate. Definitely will be back and recommend to others. I've never heard of this place until I found out about it through a friend.,UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
"Was headed back to Calgary on the Red Arrow so decided to try Villa Bistro before heading to the bus. Ordered the Caesar Salad. You could immediately tell if was freshly made, the chicken was warm and tender, seasoned perfectly. Service was excellent and welcoming. 

The salad took a bit longer than expected to arrive (that is on me) so had to gobble it down in a hurry. Would have much rather taken time to enjoy. Perhaps next trip. 

Enjoyed the first experience here and look forward to a return visit.",UqMcnY7B2WbvkC7DDnTCDw
"Steak & Cheese melt is my most fav pizza from Panago they make it sooo yummy. Their salt & pepper wings are also amazing. I also like their little dips & they have quite the range for selection as well blue cheese, ranch & cheese. Just to name a few. Can't really dine in everything is to go but I like it that way. Great pizzas for kids (especially picky eaters I have those at my house)",UwAqOh7QDJz9m9scQxH9iA
"Yayyy, finally ONE pizza place has VEGAN pizza options! It's about time! My husband and I went here on the weekend and picked up two pizzas, substituting that nasty dairy cheese for vegan, cruelty-free cheese and it was soooo good!

And unlike Famoso, who basically puts no Daiya cheese on it, and just sprinkles it on so it doesn't even cover the pizza (you suck, Famoso!), Panago actually gives you a proper amount of vegan cheeze so it covers the entire - like a real pizza should!

We are psyched that we can finally go pick up pizza or have one delivered if we want a cheat night, rather than having to make it ourselves every time. 

Delicious and fast, and we'll def be back! :)",UwAqOh7QDJz9m9scQxH9iA
"One of the best places. I'm here at least once a week to get a slice or a large pizza. 
The prices are great and the slices are always fresh!
I always get a whole pepperoni pizza with cheese on top, its great!",UwAqOh7QDJz9m9scQxH9iA
"Panago Callingwood is really great!

When I order delivery I usually get it in 15 minutes.  I'm not exaggerating... I MEAN 15 minutes!  My wife and I timed it last time we ordered.  Granted we're pretty close, but considering it takes 7 or 8 minutes just to cook the pizza, I'd say that's still amazing!

They've got tons of toppings, lots of crust options.

Any time I've ever had a problem with an order (and it doesn't happen often) I've always had a replacement rushed out to me and a credit to my account for next time.

Two thumbs up from a guy who worked as a pizza delivery guy while in college.",UwAqOh7QDJz9m9scQxH9iA
"Panago - watch out your sulking customer service.
The taste is very good and that's why customer like me came to you in the first place. Of late seem to notice that the customer service for phone ordering has been very curt. Hope this is just one of experience and they watch out and improve on this. Ultimately customer experience involves both taste and the service you provide.

Keep up the good work on your tasty pizzas.",UwAqOh7QDJz9m9scQxH9iA
"Oh Panago, will you ever stop being so delicious. As I've mentioned other times, Panago is my choice for take out. Their dough tastes fresh and have a less greasy taste (personal) than other competitors.

I like the selection of pizza offered by Panago. They have a good appetizer menu consisting of salad and wings, but I prefer not to get anything to detract from the pizza. One of my favorite dishes to order is Ham & Pineapple, but to replace the ham with Canadian Bacon. I like how they can be accommodating with orders like that.

The service at this location was good. Everything was clean and looks well kept. The people at the counter were friendly, and the pizza was prepared within the quoted time frame. Typically when you order, you are automatically transferred to the closest Panago. This was the closest location to my friend's house, so we did not have a choice to come here, however I had no problem with their service.",UwAqOh7QDJz9m9scQxH9iA
"Planned for a morning farmer's market date with my sister and nephew for their Halloween Trick-or-Treat party. The organizers put on a really cute and well managed event. Vendors were dressed up and had their booths decked out in decor. There was a scavenger hunt to find little paper ghosts for the chance to win market dollars, kids were roaming around collecting candies and there was a four piece band playing live music.

I don't want to compare to any other market in the city as I love them all. This market was designed with wide aisles which makes it very accessible for those with wheelchairs, strollers or any other assistance device. It also means you have room to shop the stalls instead of just being shuffled along like some other markets. 

The washrooms are large and clean. Parking is ample! Extended hours all weekend long. There is a children's play area for the kiddos as well. The absolute best part of this market is the vendors! Everyone is super sweet, proud of the products they make/sell and are so friendly.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"New indoor farmers' market just south of the Whitemud! Quite large and a variety of vendors. Larger than any other edm market, a close comparison to the Calgary Farmers' Market.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"Checked out this indoor market a few weeks ago since I heard all about it and I was in the area on a Saturday afternoon.  There was plenty of parking around the building however there were no signs around indicating that it was the market.

I was surprised at the size of this market and all the items that you can buy. I didn't have lunch yet that day so I was looking for something quick and easy to eat as I walked around and checked out all the vendors. I ended up with the truffle cheese pretzel which was warm and soft and very tasty. The next place I went to was Philly Wonka's chocolate factory where all the chocolate goodies are made on site. It was very difficult to choose what to buy here, everything looked yummy! I ended up with chocolate covered liquorice as well as chocolate covered marshmallows which I gave away as part of a gift. The packaging was nice and the items were not expensive. Next I spotted Pine Creek Tea, she had every kind of tea you can imagine along with tea leaf holders, tea pots and mugs and even small packets for gift giving. Again the prices are very reasonable here as well.

I didn't buy anything else that day but I'll be back.  So much more hot food to try, items for gift giving, homemade goodies, etc.  a very nice market worth checking out!",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"I'm not sure why I like it here so much but I just do. Perhaps it's the fact that Bountiful Farmer's Market is indoors so no worries about rain and snow.  Maybe it's the plentiful parking that appeals to me. It might be the eclectic mix of vendors that offer everything from wine and beer to bananas and baking that draws me in. I know that I appreciate that everyone accepts debit and credit rather than just cash.  There's also lots of entertainment on Saturday's, especially for kids. You can eat here or grab a coffee from local coffee grinders.  Actually Bountiful offers a similar ambiance to old Strathcona'Farmer's Market but Bountiful is also open three days a week (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).  There is a lot like here. I haven't done a lot of price comparisons but those things that I do like seem to be reasonably priced. I think that this is the future of farmer's markets in Edmonton as the outdoor markets are too limited to our short summers.  I recommend that you give Bountiful a try, especially if you live in Edmonton's south side.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"This is a fairly new indoor market that's open every Fri/Sat/Sunday. It's got plenty of free parking which is great - unlike the downtown and Strathcona markets where parking can be a pain. There are fewer stalls than the Strathcona market but you'll recognize some of the same vendors as well as some different. The stalls are larger and it's more spacious, feels like a more permanent layout. There's a larger cooked food area with a good selection of things to try, but less actual farmers type produce and more crafts than Strathcona - still, I came away with fresh eggs and tomatoes and local honey, and there were also plenty of local meat stalls. There's also an amazing gelato stand called Little Bear that I highly recommend! So not the best overall selection of fresh market goods of any market, but lots to look at, a good food selection, and worth stopping by if you're in the area.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"Lots of free parking, wide aisles, friendly vendors, excellent food & entertainment.  Very family oriented.  Best market on the south side.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
Love this.market. Lots of great items. The guys at the farmhouse bakery was really rude though. I will not be shopping there. But other than that I love that place!!,WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"Went to Bountiful in hopes of getting some mochi donuts but when I got there they were already sold out! Next time I will order ahead and pick them up :) I did get some fresh veggies and some farm fresh, free run eggs. Also picked up my favourite honey and found out that it's better to buy the big tubs of honey as it's less packaging for the beekeeper to have to purchase and he said it's more environmentally friendly. So true!!! 

I love the multitude of businesses you can find here. There are a few new ones I haven't seen before and I will definitely need to go back and try more things! I love walking around and talking to the business owners, getting their stories and being able to support them and their families with my purchases. 

So much delicious food here. If you're planning to go, grab some lunch for take-out too! The seating area is closed off now due to restrictions but it was definitely still a great grocery trip :)",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
Going here anytime is just heavenly. Even during the pandemic they implemented protocol and stuck with the rules and regulations. People here are friendly and informative. I've discovered many favourites like Ace Coffee Roasters and Ranch Gate Market from Sylvan Lake. I know there's more to discover. Looking forward to more visits.,WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"Absolutely LOVE this market, we meet friends here for coffee most Saturday's or Sunday's all year round. Lots of venders and variety to choose from. My three favs:
Love Irving's rashers, pudding and boiling bacon.
Have a regular fish guy now Catch of The Week beautiful fresh salmon and prawns some weeks he has fresh mussels for sales.
Transcend coffee in my opinion the nice set coffee in Edmonton. Another vender sells ice pops my daughter loves the strawberry one no matter the weather but it's always the perfect temperature inside this market.
These are my go too every week but of course other venders too just depends on my wants. 
Every week they have a theme or entertainment on. Free small play gym in the corner for the kiddies. Or arts and crafts near the stage.
I love the venue it's spacious so even on the really busy days there is room for a comfortable walk about.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"I have recently had the good fortune of shopping at the Bountiful Farmers Market in south Edmonton. What a delight. Clean and spacious aisles, a good mix of food and other products, sizeable parking area, and an eating space with picnic tables and occasional entertainment. To top it off, everyone is pleasant and welcoming, including other shoppers. This is an absolute gem!
I will be back and encourage you to rethink your purchasing habits. It is never too late to start a new one at the Bountiful Farmers Market.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"We heard about this farmers market from friends. Today was our first visit. What a great market. Very open, lots of space for vendors & Shoppers. Vendors are generous with samples. Live entertainment, easy listening music, was very enjoyable. Lots of eateries to choose from. Lots of vendors offering fresh produce, Asian, Ukrainian, Mexican & Caribbean foods. Specialty foods such as seafood, nuts, seeds, meats & vegan cheeses. Craft distillery, brewery & wines are offered. This market is an indoors market, so will be available year round. Great South Edmonton location. Ample parking. I think this will be our go to farmers market.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"Love, love, loved this farmers market! It is located on 97st and 36 avenue in a giant warehouse. There's tons of parking in their lot (they have attendants to help) as well as along the street. If you're parking on the street, just watch for little ones as it is a pretty busy road! I was there around 2 on Friday. They had live music (which was awesome!) and it wasn't too busy. I have heard it can get very busy on Saturday and Sunday. They have tons of food stalls where you could pick up lunch or dinner as well as a smorgasbord of fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, art, clothing and much more to choose from for take home. The prices were pretty farmers market standard. Loved that it's inside and will be open Friday-Sunday, year round. It was easy to walk around when we went and majority of the stalls had wonderful samples. I will definitely be going back!",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"I visited the brand new Bountiful Farmers' Market for the first time last weekend and I'm happy to report that Edmonton has yet another fantastic market to visit.

The Bountiful Market operates year-round out of an warehouse building in south Edmonton Friday to Sunday from 9-5. Unlike many markets in the city, there is tons of parking and it wasn't too busy during my visit.

They have a decent mix of produce, prepared food, and artisan goods, though I will say I could do with a few more vegetable vendors. There wasn't much to choose from on that front. While many of the vendors were new to me, there were a few old favourites as well.

I ended up going home with some fresh produce, some tasty vegan cheese, and some savoury hand pies. Even though this market is a bit of a drive for me compared to others in the city, it is worth going out of the way for. I am looking forward to my next visit!",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"What a great way to spend a Saturday! Browse the stalls of food, crafts and alcoholic beverages, pick up some fresh produce and stay for lunch! There is a fantastic selection of eateries and you might be lucky and hear some live music on the stage too. Plenty of parking and a location safely off the busy Calgary trail makes the market easily accessible.  I definitely recommend the Ecuadorian stall at the back left corner - cute sweaters, hair clips and at Christmas they had gorgeous ornaments.",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"We decided to check this place out today, on a whim, and were pleasantly surprised by the size! So many vendors, and a great variety as well. 

There's spots to grab a quick bite: one breakfast kiosk, a Ukrainian food kiosk, a Caribbean kiosk, and a few more. Prices seemed reasonable! 

Kiosks with items to sell included the traditional produce kiosks, and others for meats, seafood, sauces & salsa, woodwork, glasswork, and even a psychic! There were a few kiosks selling honey  as well 

Didn't buy anything today but will definitely be back to do so!",WSllV7Nl13wskOFWjh-BbA
"This is one of those secret haunts you wouldn't tell a new boyfriend you like, until you're sure he really gets you.  It's not fancy, the burgers come in paper sleeves and the speaker for the drive-thru is so bad you can never be sure they actually got your order right. But get over all that and have the mushroom burger (with or without Swiss cheese) or one of the many great made-to-order shakes. Just don't visit here when wearing your best duds as almost every burger comes with a great, goopy sauce that will drip down your chin as you eat in your car.",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
so sadly i did get the wrong location.. the one i was gaga over was up near 127 street.  so try to apply my rave reviews of the donair to that location.  I will try this location later if i get a chance.,WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"This is one of my favourite Burger Baron locations (each one can vary dramatically depending on the owner). 

My favourite is the mushroom swiss burger, which is hands down the best mushroom burger served anywhere! Gooey, more sauce than you can handle (use lots of napkins!) and full of flavour. Their milk shakes are amazing and super cheap (best flavours imo are root beer, rum and butter, and butterscotch). 

Their corn fritters are also amazing.

It's a small drive-through location so we usually get delivery or pickup.",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"Hands down this is my absolute favourite burger place worldwide! Each time I go back to Edmonton I am excited to eat here as I have for 30+ years. The service is quick and friendly, quality is consistent, burgers freshly cooked and fries with gravy are so tasty! Sadly I did not have their famous deep fried mushrooms this time. Their prices and deals are no match for any other fast food joint. I would be here at least once a week or more if I lived in Alberta.",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"Haven't eaten there for many years. It was great then and is still great.
We had Swiss burgers that were to die for. We're going back soon!",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
Truly the Albertan In-and-out. The mushroom burger should be as iconic to this City as the Oilers. Very mouthwatering comfort food. Big recommend.,WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"I have had the donairs here, as I have in many places, and they aren't half bad.

The meat is very good and juicy but the sweet sauce is what separates it from most donair places. It is a cold sweet sauce that is made from evaporated milk. 

Add banana peppers, tomatoes and onions and enjoy!",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
I was craving for a burger.  But not a McD's so I popped into this old establishment.  Thursday's special mushroom and Swiss delivered the carnivorous pleasures. Made to order served with the biggest smile.,WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"I love Burger Baron's mushroom burgers. It's their signature burger and they do it well. This store has specials on different days of the week that are posted on a sign out front. I love how it used to be one of the old drive in diners but is now a drive through. They've got tables inside, too but I only have been through the drive thru. They aren't open very late, I went there one night and it was closed. They're also known for their shakes which are actually pretty good though I rarely indulge. I can always count on them for their mushroom burgers and usually get some corn fritters on the side. mmm.",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"I think Burger Baron has the best fast food burgers in the city. I've always been a fan, and it's kind of a treat whenever we get a burger from here. It's pretty close to my house, yet I don't go here often (which is probably a good thing for my waistline....)

Really tasty burgers that aren't too huge (but still pretty big!), thick fries and the best gravy to top it off. They have tons of milkshake flavours as well. I love the rum and butter one myself.

I usually go through the drive-thru. I've been inside once or twice - it's nothing special, just the counter and a few tables. They have a few benches outside for those summer days. 

The service here is not great. It usually takes a while to get the food, up to 10 minutes, and the people that work there are less than friendly. They also get really busy when there are events on at Rexall. Oh well, the food is good, way better than the other chain burger places, so that's why I still gave it 4 stars.",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"I was surprised, it was pretty darn good.  Had the mushroom burger and wings.  I'd do it again for sure. :)",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"need to review buger baron but not sure im getting the right location... there was a couple of the locations on 118 ave and i went to both.  They both didnt deserve 5 stars.  

at the furthest west location.. the origional burger baron they called it.. i ordered poutine and a mozerella burger... i wont be having either at that location again.  Was served so hot i was burning mysel touching it {which isnt good for lettuce and tomatoes}

i didnt end up finishing the first order cause i really wanted a donair and the first location didnt have them available.  The one down 118 east though did... and was a quaint drive in too.  

the donair was HEAVEN... more then made up for the bad experience at their sister store... and to make it even better, this locastion makes donairs their deal of the day on saturdays.  You can get 2 donairs for 9.99.  Now thats VALUE!!!

I live south side so its quite a hike... I did have a donair on their 99 street location also since this first try.  It was ok too... very very good, but they served it smoothered in lettuce which isnt my favorite thing.  The price though is right... the serving size is right... the sauce is right... the pita wrap is soft and tasty which in my experience is unusual for donairs.  The meat is perfect.  Burger Baron does donairs right... 5 stars out of 5 and I will be back",WqxxEbwfz1xXn89jYBuQUQ
"A type of hole in the wall place that I have been eyeing quite sometimes.

As I met up with another foodie at The Art of Cake, I was thinking to make a stop before going back to the south area.

I didn't realize this business is CASH ONLY so I decided to do my quick grocery at Lucky 97 and asked for a cash back.

No dining tables nor chairs!  It's basically a place where you can get all your typical Chinese BBQ Chicken, Duck, or Pork.  They also sell sausages, fresh noodles and marinated squids.

This time, I bought a half roasted duck and a lunch combo with 1 item (I choose roasted duck).

The duck was tasty.  I'll be back to try the soya chicken or chicken feet.",YSmh3UwoCPzoLytbYKYBLw
"One of my favourites in the city for bbq pork and roasted duck. 

BBQ pork - I've never gotten a ""bad piece"" from them. I wish the outside had more of that roasted ""glaze"" on the outside though, but I think that could vary from place to place and depending on which cut you end up with. Maybe I'll ask for ""extra burnt"" or something next time. 

Roast Duck - so so so tasty and full of meat! I've sometimes gotten roast duck pieces (from other places) that are probably 50% fat and melded into the skin, making it hard to separate if you want to eat straight up fat... but I don't seem to get those icky pieces here. The pieces are still fat and juicy, but in a good way. 

Roast Pork - only had this once (when they ran out of the above), as it's not a personal fav... but my family back home would often bring this home for dinner, so I've eaten a lot of roast pork in my life. The pork skin had a good crispy texture, while the meat was tender and delicious and very flavourful. Since people that love roast pork usually love it for the skin, I'd say this passes the test since it seemed like it was pretty fresh. 

They have other stuff but I haven't been adventurous enough to try. And a ton of noodles in packages for you to take home. Things I wish they had -  ""lai-fan"", which are Chinese noodles that go great in a soup with the duck, but they're rice only!  (And cash only!). And maybe a more flavourful sauce to go with the rice instead of the generic one you always get. (Or maybe I just like the flavourings they add to the meat itself and want more of it...) 

FINALLY - the best part about this place is you can get a cheap lunch combo if you don't want to ""pay by the pound"" or cook rice. The picture I attached is a large two meat combo (with some veggies), which is $6. The boxed meals come starting at $4 for the small/1 meat. And the people there are always friendly which is a plus. :)",YSmh3UwoCPzoLytbYKYBLw
"This is probably the best place to get Chinese BBQ food in Edmonton (BBQ pork, roast duck, etc.). The quality and price of the food (both BBQ items or lunch set) is simply unbeatable",YSmh3UwoCPzoLytbYKYBLw
"Barbecue King City is one of those hidden gems in Chinatown that specializes in what else but roasted and barbequed meats. I never realized one of my buddy's parents run this place and never been. Blasphamy. Needed to change that ASAP so I went solo one Friday afternoon to grab a late lunch. 

Located right beside 97 Hot Pot and near rival Super BBQ Delight (no idea if they're actually rivals but it sounds sexy), you probably will drive/walk right by it. Maybe not though because I've seen quite a few cops drop in for lunch and you know what they say about cops...they know all the good lunch spots!

Hours are interesting as they're closed Thursday but open every other day (11am to 7pm). They have all the different types of meats (steamed, salted and roasted chicken along with pork, duck and squid) and noodles for sale. Everything is priced by the pound (around the $7-9/lb price range).

- Two item lunch box ($7.00) - yeah, you read that right. $7.00 freaking dollars for a massive lunch box filled with your choice of two meats, rice and bok choy. Yeah, you even read that last part right - you get vegetables! Almost unheard of right? Anyways, I went with the classics - char siu (BBQ pork) and siu app (roasted duck). The char sui was moist and juicy while the roasted duck was tender and had a good fat (aka. duck skin) to meat ratio. The box is basically exploding with meat and rice but I was able to finish it all. Oops.

Cash only. Seriously, for the price, you can't go wrong (if you're that hurtin', get the one meat combo for $6.00). Great spot if you want something quick and tasty to eat. So much better than CFL, just sayin'.",YSmh3UwoCPzoLytbYKYBLw
Just went in for BBQ pork in mid afternoon on a Sat. Other stores were sold out but this store still had a few slabs left. The pork was sliced in good sized pieces and sauce was provided on the side. Good taste and I picked at it alot while cooking.,YSmh3UwoCPzoLytbYKYBLw
"My boyfriend was eager to drop in to this small location last week. Having just finished another meal I was a little hesitant, but in we went. It's a very small space intended for takeout or purchasing meat by the pound. We were not starving so we decided to share a lunch combo with two meat options. You get what you expect and sometimes that's everything you need. 

We chose the BBQ pork and the roasted duck. The meat comes with a generous serving of rice with a portion of bok choy on the side. We choose to have our rice with sauce on top- the other option presumably being no sauce. The combo comes with a fair portion of both meats, but once you start eating they seem to disappear. I have not eaten around much in terms of Chinese BBQ, and it was my first experience with barbecue duck. I have to say it was really delicious and some of the best I've had in the city! The meat was tender and full of flavour, it was perfectly juicy over the fluffy bed of rice. Of course the star was the crispy skin, absolutely amazing. I am a big fan of places that serve simple options prepared very well and Barbecue King hit the mark. It smelt so good I ate my half (and probably more) on our drive home. I was very impressed by the quality. 

There were several customers that were there ahead of us and even more followed in behind us. It was nice to see the shared appreciation for great food and amazing prices. The two piece lunch combo was less than $10! They are located downtown which can be a pain sometimes, but if you're in the area it's a great option! I would definitely recommend Barbeque King if you're looking for a fast and delicious Chinese BBQ. They do only take cash and it is all takeout, so make sure you come prepared, but it's absolutely worth it! Happy to five five stars for perfectly satisfying expectations. We will for sure be returning again!",YSmh3UwoCPzoLytbYKYBLw
"Most of the time I do enjoy the food at Moxie, but this time I wasn't really impressed by the appetizers we ordered. 
I was meeting a friend in this part of the city and Moxie was one of the restaurant that was open a little later than the others.

This Moxie was a very chic and had a lot of beautiful modern decors. The layout of the restaurant was easy to map out and the ambiance was a sweet romantic calmness . It was a quiet evening with a few couples in the dining room this evening.

I like that they had a coat rack around the booth so we could hang our coats instead of having to squish our jackets inside our booth.

We sat close to the kitchen, so we were able to see what everyone was up to. 
The server was great, she came around to refill our waters and check on us on many occasions, but some reason she also seem like she was struggling with communicating with us in a customer friendly manner. Or maybe she was annoyed with my friend who had a little too much to drink and was talking a lot! LOL

We ordered the Sweet Chili Chicken that came with there hand-cut chipotle potato chips. The breaded chicken pieces were really soggy and it didn't look appealing at all. 
The Mosaic Dip was made with Quebec goat cheese, mushrooms & fresh tomatoes and it came with naan bread. I nibbled on some of the food and was quickly turned off, because it didn't taste fresh out of the kitchen. The food looked old and it didn't taste good at all. 

The description of the food on the menu was very appealing, but unfortunately we got a bad batch of food this evening.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Today Im a fan of this place. This place can be good or not but at least the managers there are usually accommodating to any problems.  Today I had the most yummy Beef Vindaloo.
beef vindaloo 15.99
tender strips of marinated steak, vegetables, ginger, garlic and shredded sweet coconut in a very spicy vindaloo curry sauce, served on a bed of jasmine rice with yogurt and curry-buttered naan bread.
The ladies had it beside me and I thought it was a bowl of beans from where I was sitting. When it came, I ate it though! It was orgasmic! I also had the bruschetta and loafs of little bread. Its not on menu but I always ask and its there!

What a change from Moxies last week or horrifying experience.  The rumors are that this Moxies is losing its quality, but for today, it was Greattt Says Tony the Tiger.

Oh, cute servers!",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Love eating at Moxies! I find the food here is good quality, comparably priced and has a great atmosphere.  During my last visit I did notice the prices have gone up by a few dollars per entr√©e.

My favourite is the beef dip, it was $22. It comes with french fries although you can get sweet potatoes or a salad for a few dollars more.  The beef is very tender and the au jus was more like a gravy consistency but still tasty.  I dipped my fries in it.  I've also had the burger, it was also delicious.  They have a happy menu from 2:00 to 5:00 but I've never eating here during that time period.

The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing.  I like how you can't hear other peoples' conversations and also don't need to speak loudly to your friends.

Plenty of parking around the building and very easy to get to.  Good location as close to the movie theatre and shopping along 137 Ave.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Awesome!! We came for a lunch and they were very prepared for that. The service was excellent, very friendly, and we got everything that we asked for. Strange how you don't get that at some places. 

I had the chicken chipotle quesadilla and it was just crazy. I haven't had a quesadilla like this in a long time. The chicken pieces were huge and a delicious salsa with lots of cilantro. 

Yummmm!",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Not a good experience and its the first time we went. Waited more than an hour for three entree's to be acknowledged that there was a mix up and food will be delayed. Trying to get our servers attention to cancel but kinda avoids us. Then when I got the attention of the other server to just cancel the food she informed me that the manager will approach us but then no one talked to us. Right after we PAID the bill for the drinks and starters and we're already about to walk out the door they will offer us coupons for us to come back?! Uh no thanks! We will never come back! I don't usually complain since I know how it is in food industry, but it was really a big disappointment.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
Disappointing Canada Day dinner.  Not only the worst Moxie's we have been to but one of the worst restaurants.  Food came 52 min after we sat down.  Terrible sushi cones and other 2 meals were cold. Manager advised kitchen running 25 min behind and offered no apology.   Will never go back.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I feel so bad leaving this review... Two major things stood out for me that I wish hadn't: my bulldog tasted so bitter even my husband wouldn't drink it, and it turns out the dry ribs were breaded even though there was no mention of breading on the menu. I tasted the lime slush on its own and it was fine, but The drink as a combo was unfortunately undrinkable due to the bitterness, and we couldn't figure out why. The bartender was nice enough to replace it with a vodka soda so it's not his fault. Most dry ribs are keto friendly and are not breaded. Our mistake for not asking, I totally get that. The ribs were very breaded, so we couldn't eat them and just packed them up and took them home. In short, the bulldog was undrinkable and the dry ribs were breaded, which like I said was probably our fault for not asking about.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
I love moxies food but the service (management included) has been brutal 2 of 3 times. Will not return to this location.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Food is always good here, and they have a decent wine list (a little on the expensive side). The staff are all very pleasant and respectful.

The lounge is great - good energy & music and sports are always on for my boyfriend.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"We were in there on a Tues night after a movie.  It was the worst food and service we have ever experience.  The hostess was also the waitress so she had to seat people and at the same time take our order, serve our food and water.  I had the sirloin which was okay, but the broccholi was overcooked and soggy and the beans were way over cooked to the point that it was yellow.  But my husband's pasta dish was bad.  He had specifically asked for easy on the sauce because he is really sensitive to salt.  It was overladen with sauce.  So he returned it and asked for a hamburger ""unsalted"" and no cheese.  It came back salted with cheese and the rest of us had already finished our meal.  At that point, we just said forget it and asked for our bill.  It took another 15 minutes for our bill, because the waitress had to sit another table and serve them first.  It was the food and the worst service ever and no one even bother to apologize.  Definitely will not go back again.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
This is a great place to go!  Gary and his team do a great job. Been going here for years.  Family friendly and great atmosphere make for a winning experience.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"The experience @ Moxies was different this time ... I found that the table was sticky when we sat down ... Not real appetizing and my drink I ordered was flat. 
I then requested the poco de gallo instead of salsa with my nachos .. Which I loved on previous visits. 
The waitress then asked the kitchen - they didn't know what I was talking about and even the manager said they didn't have it. 
Well I guess it was the bruschetta I was thinking about. What I  find really amazing was that they couldn't decipher what the hell I was talking about! They serve their bruschetta on the side in all their dishes .. So u would think they'd see the similarities ... And get what I was referring to!??? No ... Anyway .. 
We ordered the nachos with beef ... It was only ok .. Then we ordered the sushi cones and they were very good but waaaaaay too spicy for me .. Even without the dipping sauce. I woulda been nice to know that ahead of time. But there's no reference to it being spicy in the menu. 
My bf enjoyed it but I couldn't eat it at all. 
So essentially, I left kinda hungry 
 
Moxies ...hmm don't know if I'll rush back.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
I hadn't been to Moxie's in years and was pleasantly surprised by the great service and food we had tonight. I had to make a last minute reservation for 12 on a Friday night and they were wonderful for accommodating us so last minute. I had the mango chicken and it was easy for me to order it gluten and dairy free with no issues. The food tasted great and I didn't feel sick afterwards. My boyfriend received a free dessert since it was his birthday and we left full and happy.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Five of us closed out our regular season hockey year in style by heading to Moxie's for brunch. I wasn't expecting anything special when I arrived. I've been to this location many times for lunch and supper but never brunch. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the menu selection. They had enough of a variety to whet any appetite. I opted for the Sicilian sausage hash. The poached eggs were done well and their hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy. I really liked the way they prepared their shredded hash browns. They mixed in peppers and the sausage. Once you break the poached egg and let the yolk coat the hash.....it made for a fantastic meal. 

I am quite impressed with Moxie's brunch. I had low expectations walking in but they pleasantly surprised me. Thanks for the hearty meal. I will be keeping this place on my list for brunch options.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Totally disappointing experience... have only had good food and service at other locations, this was our first time here and will be our last.

Not only was our food mediocre, they totally screwed up the gluten free order -- taken off their  gluten-friendly menu!! -- and brought a salad with croutons and other questionable items. Then the replacement took three servers asking questions (including the idiotic ""How do you feel about cross contamination"" to which I replied ""I'm not a fan"") and then the replacement meal took so long to come that my three companions had finished their meals. 

Plus my husband's order was wrong, however after the ridiculous drama over mine he decided to eat it and just move on.

They comp'd my meal which seemed sub par in terms of compensation. Again didn't want more drama although our friends urged us to ask/expect more.

First time I have EVER not left a tip for a restaurant meal...",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Just returned from a great dinner.  Moxie's was spot on tonight -- service was better than the last couple of times -- thanks Reese!  I had calamari and it was cooked to perfection, very tender and juicy.  Hubby had red curry and he razed about it.  We also had dessert, which is not usual, and both the flourless chocolate cake and the sticky pudding were wonderful.  The sticky pudding may be a lot for most people, it was huge!  We will definitely be going back.
Unfortunately, the whole place needs a little refresh.  It is starting to look old and tired.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I only visit this Moxie's when meeting a friend who lives in North Edmonton, and it's always just ""fine"".

Nothing about the food screams amazing, it's not bad,  but the meals are never anything that I find myself reflecting (or drooling) over even hours later.

The service is also non-descript. Sometimes it's good, other times lacking. 

All in all, this review is  2.5/5. I wish I had negative feedback or even really any positive comments to make this an interesting review, but
 my impression is Moxie's is coasting along, doing their thing, and just existing.

Meh.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"No matter where you go, Moxies is the same.  All across Canada, you're getting the same level of service and food quality.  Or so you think.

This Moxies is one we go to when we are heading for dinner before a movie.  Some days are good, some days are bad (but you find that at any major chain restaurants).  We generally have great service here, but I think it all depends on the time of day and how busy they are.

The food is good, but I wouldn't go as far to say that it is some of my favourites.  They are constantly changing the menu, and it seems like the items I enjoy are always being removed.  I understand that they need to stay current and fresh, but some of the options seem to be more out there than they need to be.

I don't know if I would choose to return here over going to another restaurant, but if we are running out of time before a show, this will do in a pinch.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Moxie's is a great restaurant and that's pretty much all that needs to be said. Their food and drinks are great and their decor is modern. This place can get pretty busy but at lunch you can pretty much walk right in with a group of 4 or less. At dinner, you will have to wait a bit to get in, unless you get lucky and their is a spot open in the lounge (which is always preferable to anyone without kids anyways...). Their appetizers are really good, but their chicken tenders are amazing (buffalo sauce is my favorite). As for their main menu, they have some good pasta, but their chicken burgers are where it's at.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
Just finished supper at this Moxie's. The service was pretty good. The food was amazing and they even split a kids meal in half for my two children so we wouldn't have to. Definitely come here if you want good food and decent service.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"The food at this location is average at best, but the beef dip is absolutely disgusting. The beef is of poor quality, was undercooked and just plain horrible. I wouldn't feed it to a homeless dog.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
Had a decent time in the lounge. Lots of TV's my beer was never empty without another one on the way.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"This chain is fun to visit for a meal. I think this particular restaurant location is handled by a  very young teenage staff. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day.. perhaps not, but the staff seemed to be more interested in talking about what happened at school and who was dating who and also  not to mention a lot of female staff generally flirting with and paying attention more to the tables with male adolescent patrons. They filled my water glass frequently though so I guess that's a plus. Overall, the food is good and service is mediocre.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"This score should be a 3...for the food....HOWEVER, the serve was a 2....so, if I cut it down the middle, 2.5?  Again, this score doesn't speak for the food which was quite good and satisfying...rather, it speaks to the service.

So, on a chilly Wednesday night (Feb 5) I went with 2 other colleagues from work as we hadn't gotten together for the holidays for reasons of everything.  We figured it would be a good compromise, distance wise for us all and frankly, having been to this location once before, I didn't remember the service being so lack lustre.  

We all ordered mains which were quite good:  The Mustard Salmon, the Lemon/Pepper Haddock and the Chicken and Ribs.  All VERY good, even the dessert....the Tasting Trio.

What wasn't appreciated was the fact that the wait staff attending to us wasn't particularly attentive to the fact that one of us hadn't tasted a particular wine before and even said so....so instead of just putting a little bit in the glass so she could taste it....poured the WHOLE thing in and that was that.  ""Don't like it?  Oh, darn, 'sorry', you should have known"".  Basically, this is what happened.  One of my colleagues didn't like her wine and though the waitress came to ask and was told it wasn't what she expected, the waitress didn't even bother to ask:  Would you like to try a different one? or at least bother to offer to ask her Manager if she could get my colleague another glass and allow her to not pay for the first one.....since, afterall, HOW MUCH is the markup on a glass?  And while I am at it, WHAT is this NEW policy of pouring the WHOLE amount of wine in the glass?? I have seen it happen in a few other places and am NOT liking it.  It won't make me order a second glass any faster, if at all....

In the end, my colleague ordered a second glass of wine which she enjoyed more and from this point, the waitress decided that she needed to get the bill paid up after having told us that ""any time you are ready"".  WHY do people make this statement and then come back 5-10 minutes later with a pay machine?  To make light of the situation, she (stupidly, sorry, this is my opinion) asked ""What do you ladies have planned after this tonight?""  No offence, but it's Wednesday night, about 9pm.... Unless we looked like we don't need to have jobs (and I SO wish we didn't, but alas, we do ;-] ), I simply replied, ""It's a school night, so THIS is our evening"".  And in fact, we did have fun, together, chatting, laughing and eating a reasonably good meal....it would have been better if the waitress had considered the wine and also to whom she was speaking.  I get that she is tired and wanting to leave....so why not just say so and then, consider WHO you are talking with when you make the comments you do....",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Great, a place that you can make a reservation on a Saturday evening! I called a few weeks before the date to book a table for 7 on Saturday at 6PM and was able to do so.  There were people waiting for a table when we arrived so nice to be seated right away.  The one side of the table was right up against the wall so not good for those who need more room.

The server was prompt throughout the evening with taking our orders and bringing our drinks.  The food didn't take too long for a full Saturday evening and the staff looked like they were all busy to ensure food was coming out timely.  

Nothing really jumped out as a try me dish so I had a turkey club with sweet potato fries.  It's the type of meal that you can't go wrong with and a boring one too.  But for this meal, it was satisfying enough.  They charge an extra $3 for the sweet potato fries instead of french fries.  My table mates had burger, beef dip, fish tacos, chicken, and beef vindaloo, and everyone agreed their meal was good or alright.

For the birthday girl, she received a bite of brownie, which is always a great treat to end a meal.  The server brought us separate bills and his colleague helped him with machines for anyone paying by card.

Another alright meal at Moxies but likely will be a while before my next visit.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I'm giving a 3 Star rating at this time because my experiences here go between a 3 and a 4. Lately it's been a 4. Service has been quite good. Food has been very good. The patio is lovely and there's always room. We've been having the pizzas. The Italian pizza is excellent. The mushroom chicken is very good. We round it out with an appetizer and recommend the lettuce rolls, they've been consistently good 3 times in a row. Also I had a steak sandwich last time and I substituted a salad for the potatoe and switched my veggies from the standard bok choy/carrots (who wants bok choy/carrots?!) For Brocoli/green bean. The only thing that was missed was I asked for the salad dressing on the side but admittedly I special ordered quite a bit so I'm not complaining. Right now management is good. We're going back as long as it stays like this.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
Maybe it is nostalgia but I have always loved this Moxies. It is the first place I took my fianc√©. We went again last night. While it is a bit early for a patio they have a great patio there. Good size to. Anyways we sat in lounge which is also nice. The drinks were good. And the wine is decent priced. The med bread is a must have. And I tried the street tacos. Wow are they ever good!! As always a white chocolate brownie to wash it all down. All around $100 aint cheap but decent price!,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Good food, great ambiance, friendly staff. Nothing really extraordinary - but great for a night out. Not too expensive & they have half size desserts for $3.50. Really great!",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I am a huge fan of Caesars. However, Moxies served me the most brutal Caesar I've had in a long time. Lack of flavor and ""pizazz"" has soured me from coming back to Moxies for a drink. There was a garnish in the Casear, that the server said was a slice of dried mango on a skewer with spices on it. Turns out, it was a stale tortilla. Go figure. Maybe it was an off day? Not sure, but makes me reluctant to try again.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Worst chicken burger of my life. 

I went here last night, and was really disappointed. I ordered the chicken burger and sweet potato fries, and shared the med bread as a starter. 

The med bread was really good, nice and garlicky. And the sweet potato fries were delicious as always. But the chicken burger was just all wrong. It wasn't even mediocre. It came on a different bun then they had said in the menu..and didn't have an explanation from the server as to why that was. But not only that it was just ""meh"". Kinda soggy, and flavourless. Definitely not impressed. 

The server was ok..friendly enough. But didn't exactly look professional. She had bleach blond hair with these dark black roots about an inch, and her whole appearance and demeanour was just ""I don't wanna be here"".",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Moxie's is one of my favourite restaurants. It's trendy, has a great atmosphere and is close to my house. I've been here for not just dinner, but also for lunch and happy hour and have been pleased with the quality of food and drinks. On the other hand, service can been hit and miss depending on what time of the day and what day of the week you go.

My favourite drink is the candy apply martini. Yup, these are dangerous little ditty's. Talk about a girly drink drunk if you're not careful.  They also have a great rack of ribs and recommend any of their desserts.

They have a movie and dinner deal on as North Edmonton Cinema's is right behind them. So, if you're looking for a night out stop in for dinner then carry on for a movie.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
Small portions. Staff aren't very  friendly. Overpriced. Food quality very poor. Try getting refills,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"One of the nice thing about Moxie's I find is that no matter what location your at the quality of the experience whether it be the food,service,or ambiance is generally the same. I am a regular at the WEM location but was meeting a family member from St. Albert for lunch today so we went here. 

The service was quite good with the waitress returning multiple times throughout the meal to ensure our drinks were topped up and the food was tasting good. I had the buffalo style chicken tenders with a Caesar salad and they were delicious. Their Caesar dressing seems like it's partially oil based versus the creamy Kraft type dressing and is quite possibly the best dressing I have ever tasted. My cousin got the enchiladas and also thought her meal was great although she did comment that at one time they did make them larger.

All in all it was a great experience and if I was on the North side again I would definitely stop in for another visit. Much like Boston Pizza there is something for everybody on the menu and it's also right by the Cineplex which makes it a great stop before or after a movie date.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
Went for our valentines dinner tonight and the staff and manager went out of their way to make this night so special. Highly recommend this location!,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"An overall great Moxie's location. The restaurant was pretty busy when we went so we sat at the bar. The bar tender was delightful, both in regards to conversation and service. We got our drinks and food promptly (considering how busy it was).

My brother and I had the beef dip. Quite tasty but a little on the salty side. I ordered sweet potatoe fries as a side. They came with the most garlicky aioli I have ever had.... I found it delicious!",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Had a super good experience at moxies recently.  Largely credited to a well-informed, friendly, and conscientious server but also the food was great.  We were there before 6 so we caught some of the happy hour pricing. There is ample parking. The lounge is comfortable, although could be a touch warmer. 
We had the cauliflower appetizer, nicely lightly breaded and tasty dips. We also had the sirloin and the lemon basil salmon.  All were done nicely and we made several special orders all accommodated. Just things like a side salad instead of potatoes and sauces on the side etc....",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA

"Food is typical like Joey's or Earl's.
I like coming here for a drink or bite before hitting the movie theatre, or just chill out on the patio in the summer.

Never had any issues with service.  Always attentive and friendly.
Gets an extra star because there's really nothing else in the area with a patio.

PS. I do curse this place in the summer, when I'm going to my gym across the parking lot, and see all the people on the patio enjoying their drinks....mmmmmm cold beer on a hot day!",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I've been to the lounge and I was recently in the restaurant because the lounge was nutted on a Saturday night around 7pm. We were told it might be a 30 minute wait for a table but it was like ten minutes. I had a steak sandwich with fries. Other members of my party had the beef dip, the burger and the 7 ounce steak. Everyone enjoyed their food. The service was fine. The table could have been wiped down a bit more before we sat down but it's a small thing. Overall I'd easily return for another bite.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Its been a really  l-o-n-g  time since I was at Moxie's, don't really know why we decided on this place , but we did.  To tell you the truth, the host was totally inexperienced and had no customer service skills, in fact he  had some ATTITUDE, which is why I asked my date lets go.  But my date said No we'll stay. so ok We'll stay. We were seated with the rude HOST and as he slammed the menus on the table and walked away, we just decided that he was plain STUPID...  Any way our waiter came buy took our drink order, and returned. We then ordered the Appy's and it was delish, we had the bruschetta with warmed bread. So Good. We then asked our waiter about our wine choice and he gave us some advise on what we should order , but my honey picked it out.  We then ordered our main. I had the Seafood Linguine, and my date had the Penne Tuscano, a very manly dish.  We enjoy'd our pasta it was good , although I hate those little spidery octopus thingys in my pasta, YUK , I just put them to the side. But  otherwise it was good, nothing great, but good. The wine helped. Service from here on , was also  good, our waiter came by several times to refill our wine glass, which was nice, he made up for the rude host with all the attitude. No room for dessert, we were stuffed. I don't know if I'll be back, everything was good , but I found it to be very GENERIC. Not really my style.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I visited Moxie's northside with a friend on a Friday night.  We enjoyed their GT (gin and tonic) special.  I had the citrus chicken salad and my friend had the santorini salad, both very good - fresh ingredients and the right temperature.  It was a Friday night, so busy as usual, and you can expect to wait; we only waited maybe 10 minutes.  This location has a nice patio with fireplace, although it was too rainy to sit outside.  There are heaters for cool nights.  Our server was very pleasant and we only waited a reasonable time for our food.  I would definitely visit again.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I'll start by saying that I absolutely LOVE Moxie's normally..the food is great..AND the Bellini's are even better..!

But I went to this location last night for dinner, and I really think this particular location is starting to slide a bit :( I normally get the top sirloin salad, and that's what I had last night. So I'm thinking it can't be just me, because this was everyone's comment at the table last night..but are the portions getting smaller? 

Like my salad was teeny..like there was hardly any greens at all. And the steak has definitely shrunk. I actually had to order a side of sweet potato fries AND the bread pudding for desert (I mean I love desert, don't get me wrong). But that salad used to be enough for me. It just seems like the standards have slipped slightly.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA

"Moxies are pretty standard Canada wide.  This one is no different.  You can always expect good drinks and a decent menu.  I especially like this location as it is the perfect place to grab a bite either before or after seeing a film at Cineplex north!

They have a pretty good patio and their sangria is top notch!! Plus they have a great brunch menu and everyone loves a good brunch.  I had great service every time I visit this location.  I never have a hard time getting a table here but that may be because I come at non peak times? 

I can easily say that moxies may very well be the best restaurant in the complex there!",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"We have been going to this location for at least 10 years and the last 3-4 times we have gone it has just been...not good. Last night was probably the last time we will bother. The food is just ok, it's pretty standard chain food but they just don't seem to give a shit about it and it shows. The staff are barely friendly, our server last night just really didn't seem to care. Just the little things that make service special like ""oops we gave you regular fries instead of sweet potato why don't you munch on those while we get them for you"" instead of taking them away and throwing them out. Just a small gesture - but it seemed so...petty.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"I generally visit Moxie's in Toronto.  My boys usually go to the 170 St location but this time we visited this location.  I like the set up of this location.  Instead of going to the resto area, we went to the lounge.  It's designed with a warm feeling. The decor is dark with tvs all around.  There is a higher seating area and a lower level seating area with bench seating.  Probably could be used as some sort of dance floor since the tables are not stationary like say the Moxies at Yorkdale.

Very friendly staff and always excellent food.  I ordered the Kitsilano sandwich for the first time and very delicious. My colleague ordered his fave fish and chips.  Those things were massive.  

Next time my fellow mates suggest to go somewhere for lunch, it's here.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
Been coming to this location a lot over the last year (maybe too much; it's half-way between work and home). There's always a consistency of quality and the service is fantastic and that's what keeps me coming back.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Is anyone else out there in love with the moxie white chocolate brownie as I am. This dessert is a huge slice of warm white chocolate brownie with a heap of vanilla ice cream and one heap of nonsweetened whip cream, served in a puddle of chocolate sauce. And best of all its so big it's perfect for sharing with two.

Overall I have never been disappointed by Moxie but this brownie is something else. I have eaten at a lot of great restaurants in Edmonton and Moxies still has one of the best desserts in town. Of coarse if your looking for something else I would suggest the terrimiso at Sicilian  downtown.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"Moxies, you've lost your moxie. Everyone should read this. 

I was impressed by the delicious food and stellar drinks, but Jesus Christ my server was absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't believe how rude she was. Me and my girlfriend never eat at Moxies. I like it, but she doesn't. I convinced her to try it and we were severely disappointed in our server. Not only was she rude and un-accommodating, she got our order wrong. When I had to track her down (because it took her entirely  too long for her check on us) I advised her my girlfriends order came out wrong and proceeded to the bathroom. 

When I got out, I witnessed our waitress ask my girlfriend in a condescending manner ""So what? You're just NOT gonna eat it?"" after stopping at every table but ours, of course...  WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK!!!! She acted although it was a personal favour for her to go fix her mistake.

I'm truly repulsed by the experience I had here here. I will NOT be back. As it stands, this location already fails miserably with foot traffic and I wonder how they stay open. I can't believe they so frivolously treat customers like annoyances and inconveniences when they struggle to fill the seats. Is that how they are here, or is it just something about us ...

When the food finally came, my girlfriend lost her appetite. What a waste of a good night. 

To add insult to injury, I asked to speak to a manager about the terrible server we had, and our server avoided bringing them to our table 2x. 

Never ever eat here. Stacy and Scott - get your shit together. 

Sincerely.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
This is no Earls.  Now I remember why I don't come here.   The Main restaurant is open and plain like a cafeteria style place with booth seating.  The lounge was modern and cosy with round booths .  They have a patio.  Staff were attentive and friendly.  But it's all about the food.  The steak salad was not good.  The steak was small for $22 and an old rubbery marinated steak.  The vinaigrette in the salad was too spicy.  It lacked the attention to detail.   The enchiladas  were good but the tortilla chips were stale.  I would not return for the food.  Only for drinks.  But maybe I'm too fussy.,_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"When I dine out, I'm doing do as someone with severe food allergies. This limits both the places I can eat, and what I can eat there. However, the service I received today at this Moxie's location while having lunch with my parents was outstanding!

We split a plate of nachos to start (which is HUGE, by the way,) and I had the beef dip sandwich entr√©e. When I made my ingredient omission requests, the server asked me two very important questions: ""Allergy or Preference?"" (allergy) and ""Mild or Severe?"" (severe). As someone with food allergies, I hate when people cause a huge fuss over some garnish they could just pick off; it can make people less empathetic to the genuinely afflicted. Anywho... It took a bit of time to put our orders in because she had the kitchen head check every ingredient in my dishes for allergens. Then, the chef came out and gave my food the all-clear. I've never felt so safe about eating something before!

The food was good, the service was fine, (especially considering it was a Friday lunch,) but the way they handle allergies is wonderful. Definitely recommend for that reason alone.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"When we went here after a movie, it was pretty dead inside, and we had a table in the bar side really fast. I just had a beer, but the rest of the party had food. There were a few errors to the orders and very messy plates, but the food tasted alright. It's nothing special, but nothing amazing. It seems that the people behind the plating at head office don't think about actually having to serve or eat the food, as long as it looks pretty leaving the kitchen. I've been to better Moxies, but the chain as a whole is just okay.",_v8Ccd70N6uXw8muQeyhOA
"The last time I will order from here. Their ginger beef is soggy, not even a bit crispy. The cantonese chow mein noodles are crunchy and the sauce for it is like jelly. We spent 90$ there and expected for it to be better quality. I phoned to complain and she tried to tell me it was the style of the noodles and when mixed it the noodles will be softer. How can they get softer with the sauce like jelly? It was like a pool of fat. I asked for them to bring me the same things delivered to my house as I was not happy. She told me delivery would be 3 hours! They told me when I first ordered mine would be an hour and it got to my place in half hour. How does it go in half hour to 3 hour wait time? Was not impressed by the service or food so no I will not recommend or get food from there.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"Very friendly and efficient staff.  Picked up our order and everything was in the bag (food choices, sauces, etc.)
Almost everything we ordered was great - lemon chicken, friend rice and veggies, szechuan chicken and veggies, spring roll, green onion cake
The crispy ginger beef was disappointing- not crisp and very tough/chewy (required a lot of cutting). 
Overall, good and we'll be back (especially if they can improve the ginger beef)!",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"This place used to be a favourite for my husband and I. We made a smaller order a few days ago for chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken balls and wor won ton soup. We were extremely disappointed. I'm not sure if there is change in management or you guys are trying to cut corners but the food is now disgusting!! Extremely greasy for everything you get with next to no meat in everything you order. And on top of that the chicken doesn't even taste like real chicken, it has a rubbery texture with an extremely off after taste. All ingredients taste very cheap. 100% don't recommend this place anymore. It has went very down hill.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"So disappointed with this place. Read great reviews and had high hopes. We ordered Singapore noodles, honey garlic chicken, chicken balls & Chicken fried rice. Very bland taste, most of it went to the bin. For all you Irish people that are expecting it to be as good as home, it most certainly is nothing like it.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
Their food is going downhill. I ordered a combination plate which included dry ribs.  The other items were somewhat okay but the four dry ribs consisted of nothing but fat and bone!  So this is what you pay for fat and bone! The rest of the food wasn't that great. I won't be going here again !  I felt ill most of the night. This restaurant failed an inspection twice last year for cleanliness. Caution,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
I have been to this place several times since the pandemic started and it is great! I have never dined in but have picked up and had food delivered. I usually get the Combo C and the portions are very large and delicious. The staff are so kind and friendly. I am happy to have found this gem in our neighborhood! Will definitely be back!,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"This place is delicious! I love ordering from here because not only is their food good, but so is their customer service. Added bonus that their food doesn't contain MSG.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
Ordered Delivery about 2 weeks ago. We called at 7:15 and they said it would take an hour. We didn't get our food until 9:30 and it was cold by then.and we were less than 15 minutes away. Didn't mind the food but very poor delivery.,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"Wow, I can't believe there are no reviews for this local chinese food joint as it's been popular since it opened in 1979.  Maybe the problem is that the name is listed incorrectly on Yelp.  It's name is Blue Quill Chinese Food (I've contacted Yelp to correct the name.)  Anyway, this is one of the few places where you can get delicious chinese food without MSG and even on their busiest nights we've never had to wait more than 30 mins to pick up our order (usually only 20 mins).  We always order the Beef with Brocolli and Black Bean Sauce, Chicken with Lemon Sauce, Ginger Chicken, Shrimp with Cashew Nuts and BBQ Pork Fried Rice.  Entrees are in the $10 range and everything we order consistently tastes good. Three entrees plus rice and the free wontons is enough to feed two people for a couple of meals.  10% off pick up orders over $27 and free Deep Fried Wontons if you spend more than a certain amount ($35, I think).  The only dishes we ever tried that we didn't care for were the Ginger Beef because the beef was too stringy to chew, but that could have just been an off night, and the Deep Friend Shrimp which (as with most chinese food places) was mostly batter and not enough shrimp.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
Very delicious food and friendly service. Wish the portion for dinner for two was a bit bigger :),a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"This place is a bit of a hole in the wall. You can tell its been there for many years!  Food was quick and pretty good, fresh at least.  The wor wonton soup was excellent. We are still looking for our next favorite Chinese restaurant, but would go back.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
i have ordered here before to me it's always been good got a dinner for one was more than enough the staff was always been polite if you people think your gonna get good food fast from this place when there is a pandemic lock down then tell me where it is cause i phoned it in and it was ready 5 min before they said it was gonna be so you haters tell me where the better place is and i'll review it my self with no bias opinions love you be safe and take care,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"We order about $60 of food, they said one hour, after numerous calls and getting put on hold and asked each time what we where calling about. 2 hours later they told us oh we have not started on your order, it will be another 1 hour, that's 3 hours , what was your order again, I will never ever order from this place again, such poor service and they did not even care.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
I ordered from this place and became ill the very next day! Please beware. Oh wish I knew if anyone else had this same experience? Won't order from there again!,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"Excellent food and great prices. It was nice to find really good Chinese food here, we are new to Edmonton and was beginning to think it just didn't exist here. Ordered wonton soup, chicken fried rice, chicken chow mein, chicken chop suey, beef in black pepper sauce and eggrolls, which were normal ""wrapped"" eggrolls not these huge masses of deep fried batter with traces of mushy meat and veg inside. The only possible complaint would be that we didn't expect quite so many veggies in the Beef since it is not called beef with vegetables in a black pepper sauce. But either way it was DELISH!! this is now our go to Chinese food restaurant",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"Visitied this place 3 times. twice for takeout and once in restaurant.
Food is good, take out done quickly and restaurant service pretty quick.
It's good, not awesome with pretty good service.
Have returned here and will again.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
Do not order food from this restaurant.  We called for delivery and the food took 2 hours to get to our house.  They kept saying that they were almost there..  Then when it arrived the soup was upside down and the food was destroyed.  When we called they did not care.  Worst service ever.,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
Not happy with place anymore. They have changed owners and the food is going downhill which is too bad because they were really good at one time,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"We ordered delivery and the call to do so was horrible.  Very very rude man on the phone.  I understand cultural differences and language barriers however if he would have stopped interrupting and not hung up immediately after asking if 'that is all'  it may have gone a lot better.
 The delivery was quite quick. 
The food sizes for individual combos large but the food itself was bland and quite greasy. 
We wanted to go to Chan can work but the wait was over two hours. I wish we had just been patient.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"Ordered food from this place a few weeks ago. The menu from this site says the meal for 6 costs $78 but we ended up paying $95. Thought there was a delivery fee at first, apparently the online menu isn't updated and the delivery guy was nice but he didn't honor the price we were quoted online. I think ill stick with Good Buddy, its cheaper and the food quality is better.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
Nothing but good things to say about this place! The owner is friendly and I've have been very happy with the food we have ordered from here for both take-out and dining in. The service is quick and the drinks are delicious. The food is also great and doesn't include MSG which is huge for Chinese food. If you're staying in on a Friday night and want some Chines food this is the place to go!,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"The food here is tasty, but the customer service and timeliness SUCKS.

We've ordered from here twice -- once takeout, once delivery.

For the takeout experience: I arrived at the restaurant a couple minutes before when it was to be ready.  I stood waiting in the ""lobby"" area for over half an hour.

For the delivery experience, we were told 1:15 on a Sunday night.  Ok, fine.  

At the 1 hour mark, they called to ask if we could pay cash instead of Visa as we mentioned placing the order (cash? does ANYBODY have more than an emergency $20 in their wallets nowadays?).  We said ""no"" then they quickly said ""oh, it's ok, the machine just got back and we'll be sending the driver right away.""

Fast forward *45* minutes (we are a 10 minute drive from the restaurant) and the guy shows up with our food -- lukewarm at best -- and has the nerve to request a tip, not once but twice!

We told him ""no tip when you show up 30 minutes late!""

As for eating in -- not an option.  I didn't even want to sit down while I waited for takeout that night... the chairs & tables are old and nasty.

Sadly, despite the service issues, this remains some of the better Chinese Food we've found in Edmonton.  Not sure why it's so hard to come by -- our previous city of 10% the population had several good ones to choose from!",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"I've eaten at many chinese restaurants in Edmonton. This was by far the WORST experience. I went there today with a buddy to eat out for New Years. The server completely ignored us for 10 mins straight. So my buddy went and asked the lady at the counter if we could have menus. We ordered two Hong Kong noodles and one green onion cake. I asked my Hong Kong noodles to come without bean sprouts. When the order came, they didn't even put any other vegetables that usually come with the dish. So I told the waiter that I said only no bean sprouts. So he goes in and brings me back the dish with some veggies just tossed on top of my meal. Then, he forgets to bring my green onion cake. So, I have to remind him again and then what he brought was the WORST Green onion cake I've had in my life. The thing was sooo dry. It felt like a cardboard in my mouth. Also the dish was super super greasy. There was literally oil dripping all over the plate and the dish. The oil didn't even make the food taste good. My buddy didn't even care to eat half his meal because it was so bad. It seemed to me that they cared more about their take outs rather than serving their customers inside their restaurant.",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"Blue Quill offers average Chineez fud, but nothing more than that.  Blue-eyed Chineez fud experts can't be mistaken about this being the best Chineez fud around, can they?  ;-)",a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
There is no better fresher Chinese food in Edmonton. Quality ingredients and NO MSG! Very friendly service and speedy delivery. Thanks you Blue quill:),a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
This place is great for pickup orders. As they dont have alot of drivers. They realise this so. If you can plan to pay cash on arrival. You will be honored with a discount. Now for the food. I have found my favorite dish to be the crispy ginger beef. It isnt overly crispy which im ok with. Sweet sour pork is always spot on. My only bummer with this place is the lemon chicken. Maybe due to size of chicken fillet being large. There is always major issues with the batter. They make their version of lemon chicken with sauce on the side ( which im not used to ). As said dont go with delivery unless you are ok with waiting. As said before me. The dinning room is dated but has a dated charm that is slowly dying out. I enjoy the old deco. Its some where id feel like my grandmother would enjoy. The lady that normally takes the orders is very nice and easy to order with. ( returning customer ).,a24bmNPatJARqO1H4QnWgQ
"Not a bad place to come for breakfast. Fast service, food was good and cheap. Haven't had lunch or dinner so I can't comment on what they have on there menu.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"We've been going here for years. Breakfast is always fantastic,  tastes home cooked like mom's. Prices are very good. Get there early on weekends to get a table, they fill up fast!",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"The food was ok. The service was absolute garbage.

My wife and I stopped off cuz we were hungry. I ordered a bacon cheese burger with mushrooms and fries on the side and she ordered Philly cheese sandwich and mashed potato.

I received a mushroom burger fries and gravy and my wife received Philly cheese sandwich and fries.

Yes...the gravy was on my bill. I didn't touch it. I hate gravy...and my wife was looking forward to the mashed potato but she never eats fries... i would have mentioned it to the waitress had she actually spoke to us during the meal at some point, and I had to chase her down so I could get the bill.

If this place mailed me a $100 gift certificate i would throw it away. Bad service. Terrible",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
Very underated. Went a couple of weeks ago. Had a club with onion rings. Food was pretty good. The customer service excellent and the atmosphere really comfortable. It was a lady who served us. Not sure about what the other reviewer was talking about but hope that's not true?,d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"JB's is old school - a great little diner with cheap prices, great food, big portions and very friendly older waitresses. I've only ever had breakfast here and haven't been disappointed. Ask the waitress about the specials, they usually have some sort of massive breakfast boat that is of pretty good value. The only complaint I have is their sausages aren't great. Go for the bacon instead.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"I never venture to the northeast side of the city, but recently a friend and I found ourselves in the Old Town Beverly. We noticed Jay-Bee's and decided to come back for breakfast the following Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised. It has a sort of old school diner feel, and the decor is pretty nice. I was happy to see turkey bacon on the menu. I don't often find that. The service was good, the food was good, and the prices were fair. Can't wait to go back again.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Jay-Bee's is a big restaurant over in Beverly, and it's one of my favorite places to go for breakfast and brunch on the weekends. The restaurant is clearly a vintage beauty that's been polished up, and it's the perfect mix of retro diner without that tired, dirty feeling. 

Meals are large and great value - I prefer the breakfast combos (I usually opt for an omelette and pancakes). The pancakes are big, fluffy and slightly sweet - they're my absolute favorite and rival my love for the pancakes on Route 99. My significant other has tried a few of the dinner dishes (beef dip, fish and chips, etc) and they are 'diner' acceptable but not a complete home run. I think that the breakfast foods are the best part of the menu and I believe they serve them up until about 8PM.

Service at Jay Bee's can vary, simply because sometimes they are too full and understaffed. The staff members are friendly and attentive, but sometimes there are just too few of them. 

The restaurant can get busy but we've never been able to NOT find parking, and we've never had to wait for a table. Overall, it's a great little place over in the East side of our city and I would definitely revisit for some pancakes and eggs.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"JB's reminds me of the kinds of restaurants that my grandparents liked to go for breakfast, but the decor has been nicely updated. And there's lots of flat screen tv's located around the room if you want to watch sports while enjoying your meal. 

Price-wise, JB's is competitive with Denny's and Cora, but I find my meals more satisfying here. And they often have specials. On Thanksgiving, I greatly enjoyed my Roast Turkey Benedict, which came with a homemade Hollandaise sauce.

They have an all-you-can-eat pasta special on Thursdays for $10. It's not Corso 32 or Cafe Amore, but you don't need a reservation and it's a good value.

Oh, and they serve pancakes to kids for free.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Great breakfast spot! Friendly service, good prices, and decent diner food.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"This restaurant is awful, the decor is a mix of 'Eww, how long has this been here?' and 'Did they get that from the Ikea dumpster?'. The service was alright, that was the best thing I had to say about the place. The food is unknown, and I mean that as 'I have no idea what I ate.' My burger slid out of the bun...and my onion rings tasted like popcorn. Yuck. I am getting nausea's thinking about this meal.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"First time going here since it was Big Boys restaurant, food was good and hot , fries were crispy and the Monte Cristo has real Turkey . Server was quick , can't complain.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"I have been to this restaurant twice with the first time being great where I would have rated it a four, but the second time was lacking in service and food quality and would have received a two, so I have split the difference. Breakfast was great and I loved that we had a carafe of coffee on the table, but when we came back for dinner on a different day, the waitress seemed disinterested. When I asked for salad instead of fries (an option that is available on the menu) she brought me a side salad that I was charged extra for with fries on my plate. She said that she would fix it on the bill but when the bill arrived the charge was still there. I asked for Italian salad dressing and she brought me thousand island dressing and insisted it was Italian, until a different waitress stopped her and got the dressing that I had asked for. The salad itself had brown lettuce in it and was less than fresh. This is quite a distance from my home, but we may go back - for breakfast.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"This place was actually quite good! 

It was clean. It was pretty busy. We like busy...means the food turns over quick!

We had breakfast here and it was as good as the big ""D"""" as far as quality, if not better. 

One thing we REALLY liked about this place was the fact they put a whole carafe  of coffee on your table. No waiting for the waitress  to come by and refill it. Definite plus, and the coffee is good!

Food was great, too. Home made  and very generous.

Only downside was we had to wait for the bill for about 15 minutes after we were done. Other than that, it is a great  place for  a good breakfast!",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"I'm reading the reviews of JB's here on Yelp and noticing they are very mixed. I had my first experience here the other night, as the person I was with told me his workmates recommended the place highly. This is a diner with all of the things you would expect to find on the menu: breakfast, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, and traditional mains like fish and chips and hot turkey. Some of the breakfast offerings are quite unique for this sort of establishment, like the option of beef sausages and turkey bacon with your eggs. I had one of the ""scrambles"" with smoked meat. It was more like a flat omelette that was so huge, it covered the plate. Underneath was a bagel which was very fresh and actually tasted like a bagel (as opposed to some places where bagels just taste like bread in a round shape), and hash browns. The server said they were going to be cubes, but they were small strings that were a bit greasy, and a bit overcooked in places, but then again this is a ""greasy spoon"" sort of place. My eggs tasted heavily from the smoked meat, as it should have, and the onions were sweet and cooked. I held the marble cheese that would also have been a part of the dish. I was totally stuffed at the end, and the dish was less than $15. The place was clean, spacious, and the service was good - my server went back to the kitchen several times to get answers to my questions. I will definitely be back if I am in the area, and I hope future visits will live up to this one.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"This is my families first time at this location and found the food to be good, not really greasy as mentioned in other posts. Very home style cooking.. 
The only complaint came with the omelet, they didn't cook the extra ingredients into the omelet, it as placed in the middle and some of the ingredients were not fully cooked and still slightly raw.

Atmosphere is unique, there are some real up to date looks (black brick) but then there are these large gold looking bricks that look like something from the 70s. Overall that has no real bearing on the quality of service or food, both of which rate decently.

One thing that our family likes is the parking lot is decent. We love smaller places for good food and atmosphere and service but typically hard t get parking.. this is really good!!!",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"I don't think I've ever given a 1 star but the star is for the place being really nice and roomy on the inside and it has a nice vibe and it has good potential. I'm struggling to think of anything else good but I can't add anything to the positive list :( We went here yesterday for breakfast. I have never been to a breakfast place where they didn't serve fruit with the meal, even in third world countries this is customary. And so you'd think the prices would reflect that but for my husband and I and 2 kids meals it came to $45 with tax and tip. I could have gone somewhere nice for that price. The food was all beige and my husband and I had a tummy ache when we left there.  Unfortunately we got a seemly tired/uninteresting waitress. When my husband  told her it was our first time there  (to make conversation) she was like Oh. I heard others that were really friendly all around, maybe she just had an off day BUT she has THE longest nose hairs I have ever seen on a woman. I know that sounds mean and when I mentioned it to me husband (in private later on I wouldn't want my kids to hear) he said he didn't notice. We went since the reviews were pretty good but I was very disappointed in the place. I had to make a make-up breakfast for my family today WITH fruit!
I'm sorry to say I don't know where all these good reviews are coming from. The food was bland and it didn't even look appealing, no presentation or effort. I think the reason I'm so disappointed is that Beverly area is where I grew up and I was really hoping to give this place a good review, I've passed this place 1000 times and by the reviews decided to go in but it was a total let down. Hopefully owners read people's reviews as a way of improving service, just because the place is in a ghetto area doesn't mean people deserve food/service without effort.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"JB's has some of the best breakfasts in the city. You get a ton of food and the prices are very decent. Today I had bacon and eggs with hashbrowns and toast, and it was only $8.45 for a huge plate of food. There's no way I could ever finish a plate here. Lucky for me my husband has a bigger stomach than I :) Other breakfast offerings include omelettes, french toast, and pancakes. They have a full lunch/dinner menu as well.

JB's is in Beverly in the northeast part of the city. It's not too far from my place, so it's easy to get to and nicer than going to Denny's or something like that. It's got a real diner feel, in that the food is tasty and reasonably prices, and the waitresses are waitresses, darnit!, who have been doing this for years with real personality, not teenagers in short skirts trying to get tips. The restaurant is actually really big with a lot of tables and a high ceiling; very clean and open space. Every time I've been to JB's it's totally busy, but I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table. 
They have a small parking lot but it's usually full. Lots of street parking available.

Breakfast lovers, go here!",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"All in all a mostly pleasant experience. Lost a star because due to the age of the building and open door to the patio I had to flick a couple of ants off of the booth seats. Food was surprising actually. I'm a sicker for a good clubhouse sandwich and this place delivered. Turkey was real not processed slices and nice and juicy. Bacon well cooked and crispy, not under done. Nice thick layer of ham. Real cheese on it. The fries were fries. Nothing super special there but crispy and hot on the plate. Good service and decently priced as well. I'd go back.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Service here is superb, especially if you have kids. We came for breakfast and while the food is good, it really isn't anything special and the prices are not as low as some of the reviews would have you think. For around the same price, I could have breakfast at any other restaurant in town including some hotels like Madison's grill. 

The restaurant itself is clean, seems like it was updated not too long ago and the booths were comfy. 

I probably wouldn't return as it isn't near enough to home to be considered convenient and the prices aren't low enough to be worth the special trip.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
Definately better than the 127st pocation in my opinion.  Good food and decent portions. Staff seems friendky and service is good. Menu has enough choices to please most people. Wotha stop.,d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Terrible, I ordered two large pizzas- they sent, through skip, two medium pizzas. Absolute garbage, don't order from here.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"friendly service but mouldy burger bun. frozen packaged fries and patties. kitchen staff rude to waitressing staff when she sent my order back.

reviewed them on facebook and the owners contacted me on there to offer a free meal, but i never got around to taking them up on it.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Two of us had breakfast here today. Bacon & eggs and sausage & eggs. The bacon was crisp, sausage was flavorful, eggs were cooked perfectly the way we wanted them. 
The hashbrowns are homemade and delicious. Service was prompt and courteous. The only downfall was thin bland toast. We will be going back",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"It's a little sketchy but it's comforting diner food in a restaurant that's a lot bigger than it appears. Portions are good, prices are decent and the service was average. It's simple, unpretentious, greasy food. Sometimes you need that in your life, you know?",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"I make a point of stopping at JBs when I'm in the area. I have always liked the atmosphere,  and love my bacon and eggs there. I went there yesterday, between appointments. 
When I first entered they had liver and onions on for the days special ( or so I thought).  I was torn between my bacon and eggs, and the liver, as I really like both.I decided on the liver, simply because it has been some time since I've had it. I got my food. It was a huge portion, for sure. I ate about half my meal. It was about 10 minutes after eating that I got this really painful stomach ache and ended up having to run to the washroom more than once, and  it wasn't to comb my hair so to speak. I informed the waitress of my situation, explaining that there was  a problem with the liver. Response was, oh no , I don't think so. She continued to serve everyone who entered the restaurant,  not bothering to consult with the cook or the manager, on my complaint. I paid my bill, left. NO TIP. I kept the left over liver, and am seriously thinking of having it tested. I may also file a complaint with the health and safety food board. I have been a long time fan of JBs,  and don't make a fuss over little things. To be treated so disrespectfully is disgusting.  The restaurant has lost a long time customer, and I will never recommend them to anyone. I WILL  share  this experience with people. Oh yeah. I was charged 16 dollars and some cents for a meal that was on the daily special board, for 10 dollars.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"For a flashback to the good old days may I suggest that you get your butts on over to JB'S! 
They pride themselves on home style meals,huge portions and wonderful with staff!
Best place to go if you were out and about the night before ;)",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"JB's (or Jay Bee's, depending on which sign you're looking at) is an unassuming little diner in northeast Edmonton. It's similar to a Smitty's but with a more friendly, small-town atmosphere.

The staff at JB's really make you feel at home and the food is nothing to scoff at. The prices are very good for the portion sizes and the food is usually quite good.

Now, the food is certainly not fine dining, so don't expect that. But it's a step above the Smitty's and Humpty's restaurants that it competes with in most respects. The burgers are a bit weak, since they are just made from pre-made patties, but their homemade entr√©es are generally good and the breakfasts are excellent.

Honestly, I should probably only be giving JB's 3.5 stars, because while I love the ""at home"" feeling and the good prices, the food isn't quite worthy of a four-star rating. But, you can't give half-stars on Yelp and 3 stars doesn't quite capture my feelings about JB's.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Classic Diner fare. Menus are hardboard and beatup.  Seating is a bit odd and 'find yer own seat'.
The service was prompt, polite, and simple. The place was clean, even the mensroom.

The food portions are quite large, and of good quality. The sausages are great, the bacon crisp,  the rye toast just right, and my sunny side eggs were spot on.

The ham disk was a bit greasy, I did not eat the roasted tomatoes as I personally am not a fan, and forgot to ask them to remove them.

I did ask for the hashbrowns to be well done, as is my preference, but they came warmed and even on the raw side. They are shredded and quite thick, with bits of onion. If they were better cooked I think they would be most excellent.

The peach pancakes were good, with a generous portion of peaches, a few strawberries for garnish, and a big glob of whipped cream. My only complaint is they had that 'from a box' package taste.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"This place is one of my favourite.  Atmosphere is very welcoming.  The ladies work very hard to attend to your needs. JB's will do their best to make sure your are happy.  If you are a good eater, you will really enjoy it here.  You definitely get more for your money.  Another great reason is the coffee!  I don't know of anywhere else that gives you endless coffee without hesitation!   Its always hot and right in front of you in your own thermal container (not to take home).  Manager (Sam) is working hard to get more TVs installed for the customers and some background music also.  I hope it won't be too loud with the music because I do enjoy visiting family and friends here. I do recommend trying it out...you will not be disappointed.  I know (read) other complaints about the prices...please let me know when you find another establishment that is comfy and food is free and good!",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Well, after ~ 35 years attending this restaurant with children and now grandchildren , I'm done! The food has gone downhill with prices rising exponentially. The cooks don't scramble the eggs but place them on the grill and cook them flat like a plain omelette.When I tried to send them back I was told "" That's the way they scramble eggs"" If you want tomatoes instead of the greasy hash browns , there's a charge . Even turkey bacon is greasy!Buttered toast is hit and miss . Often, it's a little dollop of butter in the centre with the rest of it dry. If you send it back , the next offering is so overloaded the butter drips though. Today the pancakes were very small but not dollar pancakes . When asked the response from the cooks was they were told to do that. I left hungry and usually can't finish them. Our impression is the cooks rule the roost , the servers bear the brunt of the complaints and the owner gives you the answers you want but doesn't control the cooks . The decor has been updated and is ok but the bathroom doors have cowgirls and cowboys on them yet the servers wear long sleeve shirts , ties and vests . The owner doesn't appear to have decided on his theme . Overall, sorry to say goodbye but enough is enough . Will treasure the good memories .",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"A little rough around the edges but great food diner. 
A friend of ours goes there regularly and has fond childhood memories of the place. 
For Sunday brunch it wasn't super busy and there were plenty of open spaces. Parking is right next to and behind the building. 
The menu recently had been updated as our friend advised us- and we found there was a good selection. 
The servings are quite large and we all enjoyed what we ordered. The extra toast, hashbrowns, or pancakes is a nice touch for those with hollow legs. 
Service was decent, our food all came out at the same time and the best item was the eggs Benedict. We also tried the caramel apple French toast and blueberry pancakes. The fruit on top of these items is the super sweet sticky stuff so if you like that it is in abundance. 
Our servers were great- very pleasant and helped us whenever we asked. There was also a survey and a draw we could enter.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Jay Bee's started life as a Big Boy back in the dark ages, and while the vibe and the decor have been held over, the overall tone is now much more ""Mom and Pop.""
I have eaten here a few times and found it to be a bit hit and miss.
The food has usually been good for me, but the service can be, shall we say... inconsistent.
I get the impression that there is a lot of staff turn over.

This is a great spot for your standard ""all day breakfast"" with generous portions of fried goodness, especially helpful in cutting through a midday lingering hangover.
They do decent things with eggs and potatoes here, and make a decent burger. Grilled Cheese, fries, Club Sandwiches are all things I have enjoyed off the menu, but Jay Bee's Monte Cristo is a bit legendary in certain circles.

This is one of those places where you will find people who spend 4 hours in a booth lingering over coffee and fries, with the group changing it's make-up over the time. It is a hangout as much as a restaurant, but this is a lot of what gives it it's charm.
Regulars can add a coziness to a restaurant like this.

Why do I keep going back? 
Comfortable neighbourhood place. It has a warm atmosphere and is usually full of local regulars who tend to be characters.
The food, while not brilliant, is decent, and the portions are large at a reasonable price.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Usually I'm not the ""go out to eat for breakfast"" type, but we were feeling lazy one weekend and decided to try JB's since it was close to home base. 
Service was great and friendly, cheap specials...unfortunately this came with old burnt coffee, soggy cold buttered toast, and weird ham. Yes. Weird. Ham.
The highlight that would have me return though is the amazing French toast they have there. 

It's a MUST TRY!! But only the French toast.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Mediocre food. Bad coffee. Bad service.

I had the eggs Benedict and my husband had the cowboy breakfast.
Asked for water, never got it. They take your order , leave you with a carafe of bad coffee, drop off food, drop off bill. No follow up on the food.
Hash browns have no seasoning and my husband's were mushy, I asked for very well done hash browns. 
Deep fried sausage- yuck! 

Average prices - not cheap, not overly expensive. But for this same price I have much better breakfasts. 

This is not my normal part of town but even if it was I would not be back.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Love their breakfasts, I eat there about once a week. In my experience their lunches aren't as good",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
Nice atmosphere. Good staff. Good was ok for the cost. Great pancakes. Nice omelettes. The onion rings aren't very good at all :(,d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"Have been driving by this place for years, what a mistake. Decided to stop in for breakfast, fantastic! Nice restaurant, feels like a small town shop. Clean and yet old school feel. Had the bacon, sausage and eggs, just terrific. Dinner is next, so glad there is a good place in Beverly.",d8tLbQ9o3aVdOLgueJtYXw
"dinner on 28Mar14.  Outstanding service, likely the best we ever had in Edmonton.  Arctic Char was very good.  Duck over done.  Enjoyable atmosphere.  The service was fantastic.  We stayed at the hotel, which was average.  The breakfast is very good. Good selection and portions.  Service is above average.  The juices are horrible. We will certainly dine here again for breakfast and dinner.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Only rating a 4 because I've only ever had breakfast.   Breakfast is comped if you are a hotel guest which is a nice bonus. The room is stunning.  Formal yet you feel welcomed.  Service is top notch. Prompt courteous what more can I say.   Breakfast choices are eggs, eggs Benny, yogurt parfait, omlettes and pancakes.  Not much missing for choice.  Coffee is really good and you have your own French press.   Love eating here.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Superb service, amazing food, business casual atmosphere. Fresh ingredients. Superb quality meat and vegtables.

Service is top notch here. Water glass refilled and very detailed classy service.

The food is simple with a classic touch to typical comfort foods. I always am fasinated with how they make a classic dish unique with simple fresh ingredients. Scalloped potatoes elevated with a unique cheese, tender brussels sprouts charred perfectly with bacon, or a snitzel unique with panko crumbs. My arugula salad was so fresh, the crispy prosciutto was divine, and the fruit was fresh! 

The food is outstanding and everytime i eat here, i am blown away with delicious food. Its pricey, but if you want to splurge then its a place you wont be disappointed at.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"My husband I went here for Edmonton Dining Week, it is a treat that we do occasionally when there is this 3 course for $45 deal. First of all the restaurant itself is elegant. Fireplace, beautiful silver and grey accented furniture, and dark wood gives it a feel of elegance and sophistication. Also, service is excellent. Even when the restaurant was full  my water glass was filled and I was asked how I was enjoying the dishes.
And onto the food....my husband and I ordered each a different choice so we could sample everything. There was some hits and some misses in the meal....first the hits...apple braised pork cheeks were flavourful and melt in your mouth soft. And the parsnip puree and the red cabbage were complimentary to the dish. The pan seared steelhead trout was delicious and I enjoyed the lentils, however the carrots were not cooked long enough. They were hard to cut/eat, so I left them on my plate. My husband enjoyed the beef striploin. It was spiced nicely. He is not a veggie fan, but I think they did a fantastic job with the charred tomatoes and Brussel sprouts. My husband also enjoyed the smashed potatoes.  And now to the misses. I was really, really disappointed with the beef tartar. I have had much better in Edmonton. The meat was much too chewy and lacked any flavour. Won't be ordering this again. The cr√®me Brule was a generous portion, and cooked well but seemed to me to be too sweet. Not horrible, but not terrific. I will come back here for Edmonton Dining week because for the quality of the service, and the chance to try something interesting. However, I won't be venturing here before then.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Came here tonight with 5 other colleagues and overall it was a good experience. It didn't warrant 5 stars but it was a pretty solid 4....

To begin, they were able to take a reservation for 7 with only 2 hours notice - that's pretty accommodating considering the holiday party season. There were 2 other very large parties this night, along with smaller groups of 4 or less.

The restaurant is nestled inside the very quaint Union Bank Inn. This historical building is nicely decorated with fine finishings that make the restaurant a good date, or special occasion place.

The service is excellent with very attentive service but not in a pestering way. Professional, courteous, and knowledgeable about the food, wine, and specials.

The food was good, but just short of great. The Stuffed Yorkie was a great starter, although the dish should have been hotter. I had the beet salad with a VERY healthy portion of Chevre cheese, but unfortunately, the dressing was fairly plain almost borderline bland. I had the Artic Char and it was cooked just right but again lacked depth. It could have used a little bit of spice or salt, but instead sat on a bed of tomato and olive mixture that wasn't really sauce and didn't resemble tapenade. Others had the pork shank, beef & lobster, and steak special....alll were good.

Desserts were also notable, especially the creme bulee - which was egg nog flavor tonight. The other 2 desserts we ordered were the Apple Tarte Tatin and Choc Truffle Torte. The Tarte was very good, flaky crust and good amount of apples and flavors. The Torte was good, with callebaut chocolate that was not too sweet or bitter.

All in all a good place but there's room for improvement in my books to earn the 5th star. For a comparable price/place, try the Wildflower Grill and RGE RD.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"The best thing Madison's has got going is atmosphere and service. The ambiance was romantic and comfortable (right down to the furniture) and the service was prompt and (mostly) helpful but unobtrusive.

The food is good. Nothing mind-blowing here, but solid. I ate a six-course fixed menu for Valentine's Day and was alternately indifferent and impressed. The tomato basil ""pistou"" was essentially a minestrone; I didn't enjoy the chunky texture and could have used a creamy accoutrement. The bread rolls were schmeh and I suppose it's one of those background things but details say a lot about overall direction in menu. I don't like eating seafood in Alberta: it comes from too far away. Not that Madison's billets itself as a localvore haunt but considering the category (I'd say it's bordering on fine) and price, you'd expect there to be something that pops out. 

The beef and salad courses were fantastic. All the flavours and ingredients were well balanced and executed well. I also enjoyed the sablefish, even though I know it came from faraway. But I couldn't get behind the other seafood courses and feel that Alberta has a lot to offer in terms of meat options. 

The only knock I have on the service was the wine recommendation. I asked for something fruity but not ""in your face, like Australian shiraz"". We were served a French _____ (sorry, can't remember the region) and it started off pleasantly enough (light, aromatic fruit, zippy acidity) but as it had a chance to decant, it became downright sour, almost vinegary. Not the nicest last few sips. 

I will probably go back but due to the cost, not anytime soon. So close Edmonton, so close.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Came to Madison's Grill this past week for the first time as part of Downtown Dining Week 2017.

Madison's Grill is located inside the historic Union Bank Inn on Jasper Avenue.  Expect to hunt for a meter to park if you are driving. 

Madison's was one of only a few restaurants that did not offer choices but rather gave a set menu for $15:

Course 1

Tequila Pressed Watermelon with Ash Aged Chevre & Cherry Tomatoes on a Bed of Arugula and Frisee tossed in White Balsamic Vinaigrette

Course 2

Pan Seared Salmon with Seasonal Vegetables, Mushroom Thyme Risotto and Grapefruit Beurre Blanc

Both courses were absolutely phenomenal.  The salad was delicious and light and the main was cooked to perfection.  Seriously might have been the best salmon I've had in Alberta.

We also looked over the regular menu and there were many options I would want to come back and try.  They also offer a $28 set lunch menu that includes your option of starter, main, and dessert.  Lunch is only offered here Monday through Friday.

The atmosphere was beautiful and spacious - the service impeccable.

My only disliked was that I ordered a bottle of San Pellegrino and was shocked to see a charge of $9 on the bill.  Most fine dining restaurants downtown charge between $6 and $7.50 for the same bottle so that was surprising and a little crazy given that it's not something they prepare.  It would be nice if they offered Q sparkling water on tap or the like.

Aside from that, the meal was perfection.

I will definitely be back to try out more of their menu.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I come to Madison's for breakfast about once a week, and I've never been disappointed. The food is excellent, and service is nearly impossible to beat, and they even bring you your own mini-caraffe of coffee -- a great thing to have if you love to drink coffee as much as I do.

Most recently, I opted for an omelette. You can pick three different ingredients, so I chose spinach, tomato and goat's cheese. It was like a glorious explosion of eggy flavour in my mouth. I smoothed out the tang of the goat's cheese with a few pieces of toast and some pan-fried potatoes. This meal left me full until beyond lunchtime.

Madison's seems like a super-upscale place -- and it is -- but that doesn't mean you can come here dressed a little more casually. I definitely recommend you book reservations, which you can do easily online since the restaurant uses OpenTable.

Madison's has breakfast down pat. I'm really looking forward to trying dinner here.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I was really disappointed with this place. My husband and I went there for my birthday we took the 6 meal cours with wine paring. On 6 meals 3 were ok the rest were not good at all no flavours and our main meal was two carrots with Tenderloin no sauce or potatoes it was really dry. The only part that was really good was the wine paring.
Not worth the amount of money it costed. And we also had breakfast there potatoes and fruits were really old and my egg Benedict had a weird taste that got me sick.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"When you dine out in downtown Edmonton, you often run into the problem where cost battles pretension in a war between the rock and the hard place.  My first trip for lunch at Madison's solved that problem nicely.  Upscale yet comfortable, classy but inviting, the Coco Chanel-like black and white theme mixes with a 1930s hotel interior to say ""You're in a nice place, but you won't break the bank"".  I tried the Mac n Cheese, intrigued because the menu description made little mention of either, and enjoyed the meat topped dish very much.  My fellow lawyer guests loved their salmon.  As for atmosphere, they wore suits, I wore shorts with a collared shirt, and I only wished that I had time for a scotch at the bar.  Not quite the Hotel Mac, but that can be a good thing at times.  A great find.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I am rating this restaurant solely on breakfast. My husband and me do an annual stay cation in Edmonton's downtown core after Christmas, and this time we stayed at Union Bank Inn. Breakfast was included with our stay. Holy crap, this is no continental breakfast (for the better). I had the BEST eggs benedict I have ever tasted. We both agreed that this was the best breakfast experience ever. We would totally go back and pay full price for it. The service was good, but the food-- go for the food! It would be difficult to go back regularly because of the lack of parking, but I would, as it would be worth it!",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"We were here on April 15th, a chillier Spring day and after quite a while of being here....

Overall, it was quite nice and the staff very attentive.  

We came in and were seated quite quickly.  I was surprised at how quiet it was when we got in, however, by the time we left it was busier.  We ordered a 1/2 litre of Pinot Gris (house wine) which was quite good and from there we ordered:  the Scallops and pouched prawn and the Crimini Croquette appetizers.  The Croquettes were very good and had a really nice white sauce at the base which was just enough :-)  the scallops and prawn were enjoyed by my companion too as he said the taste was fresh and they were not overcooked.  My companion chose the vegetable ravioli and I went for the wild caughy Arctic Char (which almost confused me with salmon....our waiter told us that it was char as it does has the same colouring when it is wild and not farmed :-) ).  The ravioli was al dente and not overloaded with sauce and my Char was very good with the accompanying vegetables.

Our desserts were wonderful!  I had the ""Love at First Bite"" and my companion had the ""Dulce de leche"" Cheesecake.  Both were the perfect size and SO nice tasting to top off a lovely meal in a quiet and easy space to just enjoy each other's company without the usual ""noise"" that is now very ""in"" at many local restaurants and eateries.

Have been this evening, I remember why we have missed coming and are SO glad the service and quality have always remained the same:  VERY good and inviting :-)",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"What a hidden gem. Madison's Grill is located in the boutique hotel Union Bank Inn in the heart of Downtown Edmonton. Currently they are allowing seat in dining but it is expected to wear a face mask when in areas of the restaurant such as washrooms or lobby.  

I went to Madison Grill on a Sunday at 10 am. No reservation was needed. They allow group sitting for up to 6 people. The brunch menu is small but good. I had the French toast at $14. Great taste and portion. 

The Menu for Brunch could use some expanding to allow more variety and choices for people who are vegan or Vegetarian. Otherwise Madison's Grill is a great place to have a delicious meal.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
Last night was our first time at Madison's Grill. We took a chance and ordered the chefs surprise 6 course meal. My husband and I love great food and trying new things and I have to tell you this is a five star restaurant! Every course got better and better. The Chilean sea bass on lobster risotto was one of the best meals I have ever had. Absolutely recommend to everyone!!,eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I went here for lunch during downtown dining week. It's located in Union Bank Inn and I was surprised I've  never heard of this place until now. Inside is very spacious and reflects a true fine dining experience. Certain tables will have couches as seats. The service here is very friendly and welcoming.

As for their $18 set menu:

Aruguala Salad-this was a tasty salad. Although the ingredients were simple, they really enhanced each other. Fresh pears, crispy prosciutto, parmesan and walnuts are delicious together as a salad. 

Pork Cutlet-this really reminded me of the Schnitzels I had in Europe. It came with wild mushroom sauce, cheese scalloped potatoes and bacon seared brussel sprouts. I found that the pork got a little too dry near the end becuase there wasn't enough sauce. The potatoes were soft and creamy. I really enjoyed the seasoning of the brussel sprouts


Overall I'm glad I've discovered this restaurant and wouldn't mind coming back to try their full menu next time!",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"A very special ""Thank-you"" for a wonderful brunch that went above and beyond for our 40th wedding anniversary.   The food was all amazing.  We have 2 family members who are vegan and so I called the day before to see what the options might be.    I left it with the chef who prepared an awesome savoury vegan brunch.    The dining room is lovely, the food was excellent and the extra vegan service was really appreciated.   Many thanks.  We will be back.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Our server was the only reason I gave two stars instead of one, he was prompt, polite and friendly. 19 dollars for 3 scallops that were rubbery and completely flavourless de-railed our dinner experience train very quickly but my partner and I stayed optimistic because almost every entree on the menu looked to be a good choice. I got the pan seared sea bream and she got the rabbit. All I can say is that both meals were almost flavourless. The fish tasted like tilapia you buy from Safeway and throw in the oven. My brother and I caught a rabbit when we were teenagers at my cabin in the foothills and bbq'd it after butchering it ourselves and made a much better piece of meat then was served to us last night. Every single aspect of the food was underwhelming, there was no wow factor that a 40 dollar dish anywhere else has. The word bland was used by both of us with every part of both our meals. Our server asked how our meals were and I was completely honest with him. He took it very graciously, and didn't charge us any of our 39 dollar alcohol tab to try and make amends. Highly unlikely either of us will ever go back. Mucho burrito would be a better choice for a night out...",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"It was date night and we usually try a new place to eat.

Booking reservations within two days was a breeze. I took a glance at the menu and wasn't thorougly impressed as it served a lot of staple dishes but I tried to go in with an open mind.

To start off, parking is quite challenging. I parked right beside Madison's in the Impark lot and for some reason, I think it might have double charged me. Long story short, no ticket slip was given and I had to pay twice. That kept me thinking all night.

We were seated in the middle of the restaurant and one of the strong points of Madison's is the environment and d√©cor. Floor to ceiling columns tasteful adorned the dining hall with intricate crown mouldings made me really appreciate the attention and detail of the restaurant.

Our server, who was a trainee was able to recommend some dishes to us. It looked as though he was the only one as he was quite busy talking to other tables while we waited for him. Unfortunate that he was the only one on the floor but you would think there would be more servers?

My date ordered a cosmopolitan and I ordered their signature bloody caesar. I think wires were crossed because I simply got a bloody mary. We were recommended to try their seafood pinchos and calamari. Although I had a bite of the seafood pinchos, they were extremely delectable and each of the three sampler pieces were very unique and delicious.
The calamari I had ordered was battered and fried reasonably well. However, it wasn't as flavorful and lacked a certain amount of savory. The marina dipping sauce that came with it was a little too subtle and could not make up for the lack of flavor of the calamari on its own.

Our main dishes were the Chilean sea bass and the 12 oz. striploin. The sea bass was marinated wonderfully and the buttery texture was further enhanced by the more rough quinoa. My striploin was cooked a little too well for medium rare. It was a fine cut of meat and tasted well. However, the peppercorn seasoning was too much as it made the steak extra spicy. The mashed potatoes, sweet cabbage and asparagus were fine and it would be what you would expect from a steakhouse such as The Keg.

Overall, we had a pleasant evening. I think I was too hyped for this establishment especially when it is noted as award winning. The ambiance is very unique but the food apart from the seafood is nothing surprising.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Madison Grill is located right on Jasper Ave in an old historical building and Union Bank Hotel. The restaurant itself is quite posh with big comfy upholstered chairs set at quaint tables.

We stopped in for lunch with a friend to try out their downtown dining week special. First coarse was deep fried cauliflower in a spicy thai sauce. It was the perfect combination of savory and sweet with just the right amount of spice.

The main entr√©e was a  piece of perfectly seared salmon on top of a small bed of buttery lemon orzo pasta with a couple broccolini. The dish was flavored beautifully but was a little on the small side. I noticed that plates oderded off their regular menu had very generous serving. I have to say their salads look killer.

To fill our bellies we decided to share a dessert. We went with the chocolate dome (sorry I can't remember it's official name, it was something to do with love). This dessert is a very rich mousse that is encased in a truffle chocolate dome. In the center is some thick raspberry sauce. The plate is garnished with some raspberry coulis. I'm glad that we were sharing this plate because it was very rich. I just wish there had been more coulis because the tartness of the sauce really helped cut down on the chocolate overload.

Overall it was a great lunch. I think this place would be super if you wanted to impress someone with a fine dining experience in Edmonton .",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg

"I was here for lunch recently and enjoyed the coq au vin as my main course and the bread pudding as my dessert. It really is a beautiful restaurant and I like the fact that they took my bulky winter coat for my when I arrived (providing a coat check token). The staff were really helpful and it's a fancy place with good food quality so all in all I had a good lunch meal. I love the decor and the attention to detail in this space. I was here on a slow business day before a long weekend, so I'm not sure how it would feel if the place were busier, but I really do like the food and the staff were very attentive and helpful.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I KNOW!!  For all the times I have been here for dinner, I have never NEVER given Madison's Grill any review below a 3....in fact, I have always given this establishment 3.5 and up.

Maybe Madison's Grill doesn't do brunch well.  This is one time where my calories were wasted on my meal. It has taken me over a week to write this review because I am still trying to wrap my head around what happened.

First off, it took 3 phone calls to confirm this reservation (Easter Sunday....first call to make the reservation for BUFFET Brunch at 11:30--done. Second phone call to be asked to decide on one of two seatings: 10:30 or 12:30 [because the person I originally spoke to misunderstood the system for brunch] BUFFET Brunch. The third call was made to me to give them a credit card to reserve the table for BUFFET Brunch. You are wondering why I have written BUFFET so many time and in CAPS.  Well, this is what I asked each time and each time it was told to me that it was a BUFFET....NOT so. First.
Second. We get to our table well enough and the staff is quite nice.  The room is NOT overly booked so silly me thinks that the kitchen is okay .... 
Third. For the money we paid (44.95 per person), we received a 1/3 cup of yogurt parfait, a small basket of mini puff pastries (1-2 per person), and then you could select one of the ""brunch mains"".  We all picked the same one: The spinach (bitter) with emmenthal (none that I could detect) and mushroom (VERY nice, actually) omelette.  I would have thought we would have had a bit of a treat, alas, this was not so.  On the side, we got a full cup of roasted cubed potatoes, ketchup and two Texas size slices of toast with unsalted butter....yep. The omelette was uneventful I have to say and I am so sorry to have to say so because I LOVE omelettes.
Fourth. The conclusion dessert a board with mini desserts...3 truffle balls, one mini tiramisu cube, a slice of cheesecake torte.
Fifth. Mimosas (Blushing, regular) and Prosecco glass $10 & $15 each.

The final note was when our server dropped the drinks (NOT her fault) and she was mortified.  No harm to us, however, the host of the room didn't even notice as he went from table to table and when he came to ours to ask how things were, we all looked at each other a moment to understand if he noticed what had happened or ? 

Again, this is the first and last time we come for Brunch.  We have enjoyed coming for dinner in the past and this is NO lie.  But given that the room wasn't bustling busy I am surprised we had the culinary experience we did.really.surprised and not in a good way :-(",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I came here on an office lunch, my boss was paying so I cant really complain about the price. I had the lamb, it was scrawny and many not have had a happy life before it became my lunch. This place seems like an institution in the downtown area, it servers a specific purpose for the business community here. Office lunches, meetings with colleagues you want to impress, networking, etc, you get the picture. My colleague had the turkey and enjoyed it, another had the burger and also liked it. The deserts were good. The service was FANCY and not in an unpleasant sort of way.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Went recently for a birthday party and it was certainly worth checking out.   Was my first time there and I was pleased for sure.  

Was nice and quiet as it was a Tuesday and the service was good because of that.  I'm sure it normally is though based on the size of the place.  

I had beef n lobster which both were cooked well and I was happy.  Also the mashed and asparagus that came with it were both very good.  

I wasn't to stoked with the appy we had which was these crab and cheese balls as they were very bland with little crab taste and no real seasoning it seemed.  Maybe just not for me but I wouldn't recommend those. 

Also had Creme Brule which was solid and is get it again for sure.  

Overall I'd say four due to a couple things like the appy and the shaky table, seriously so stupid to have that at a place that nice.  

But I'd gladly go again and would tell friends to try it.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"During a stay at the attached Union Bank Inn we dined at Madison's twice. 

Dinner had decent if slightly cold service, the food was mediocre and for $200 I would expect to be wow'd but certainly wasn't. Everything served was pretty subpar and left a lot to be desired. I had the scallops and my partner had the quail. Upon tasting the sauce on my dish he commented that it tasted like the sauce from frozen pizza and I had to agree... certainly not worth the $42. The desert also tasted like a pudding cup with marshmallow fluff on top, generically and overpoweringly sweet without much actual flavour. My companion did seem to enjoy his quail though and I would have been more generous with 2 or 3 stars if it hadn't been for breakfast.

Breakfast had service so bad I had to wonder if we'd stumbled into a Denny's. There was only one other table in the restaurant but the server was so rushed that he walked away before I could finish telling him my order. He did come back to take the rest (looking highly annoyed that I dare interrupt his time) but when our food came he had brought me the wrong thing anyway. After the fix (ie: going to the garbage can to toss the portion I'd asked to omit) the meal was delicious. I just couldn't believe how this man treated me. 

Overall, I would avoid Madison's. The Union Bank Inn is a gorgeous hotel but the restaurant totally ruined the experience for me. Paying more for underwhelming meals than for my hotel room itself is very disappointing.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Madison's Grill is the top-end restaurant at Union Bank Inn. It's well-known as one of the best dining places in the city. As expected, it is expensive. I went there and had a $20-plus salad with a lobster tail on it that was absolutely delicious. I also had a $40 bison steak that wasn't that good. I found it a bit tough. But in fairness to the chef, I didn't order it rare which you're supposed to. It's a very nice, smaller and intimate space. If you're waking up at the hotel and having brunch here, the coffee is wonderful and the breakfast menu is fabulous. The staff and servers are more mature, respectable and present well. My boyfriend was a bit embarrassed when he asked what they had for beers on tap and the waiter replied, ""We don't have a tap here, sir."" The wine list is lovely and you will have a memorable meal, but be prepared to splurge.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I'm giving Madison's only 4 stars because of its price point.  The food was excellent.  I had the split pea soup and the duck breast. Both were first rate.  The wine list was adequate. Service was good. I just felt that for Edmonton the price point was higher than it should be. Entrees were, in my view, $10 more than they should be.  Recommend but keep in mind that it's pricey.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"My husband and I went to Madison's Grill to celebrate his birthday, along with my Aunt and Uncle who were celebrating my Uncle's retirement.
As soon as we arrived, we were seated by a very friendly waiter, unfortunately, he was not the one waiting on our table.
My aunt asked for the tasting menu, and our waitress informed her that its not recommended if only one person at the table wants it because then the timing of the dishes is off, and she will be getting dishes while everyone else doesn't.  We all agreed that we didn't mind, but then the server scrambled and said that its actually too much work for the kitchen to compile a tasting menu for just one person.  That is understandable, and that is what we should have been told in the first place rather than a fib about it being for ""our convenience"".  It also does not say on the menu that the tasting menu is only available for an entire table.
With our appetizer and entree orders placed, our server brought out buns and butter - I asked that she bring extra butter, which she did, and threw it on the table in front of me with a roll of her eyes.
For appetizers, we had the pork belly ravioli, the shortrib & gnocchi soup, and the twice baked goat cheese souffle.  All were delicious, though the soup seemed like the worst value at $12 for a bowl.
For entrees, we got the bison, the arctic char, the lamb shank and the pheasant breast.  Again, every single thing on each plate was delicious.  The meat was all perfectly cooked and fall-off-the-bone tender.  The sides (mashed potatoes, potato pave, mushroom risotto, and potato strings) were tasty, and we each got a nice selection of veggies.
The service, however, continued to be somewhat disdainful, bordering on being outright rude.
We should have ended the meal there, but we made the mistake of ordering dessert.  Obviously, desert is not Madison's strong point.
We got the upside-down blueberry cake, the apple tart, and the ice cream sandwich.  The only really yummy thing was the blueberry cake.  The apple tart was overly spiced with cinnamon (and I love cinnamon), the crust on the tart was very tough, and it came garnished with almond brittle that was impossible to eat.  The biggest let down was the ice cream sandwich.  We got a a 1""x1"" square of chocolate cake with a minuscule layer of ice cream inside, this was accompanied by a 1 oz cup of ""milkshake"".  This tiny dessert cost us $10 (the same price as the other 2, relatively large portions), and what little there was had no taste at all.  When the waitress came to retrieve our plates (not asking how it was), we made sure to tell her that not only was the price point ridiculous for such a tiny serving, but that it didn't taste like anything at all.
Then she never came back.  We waited at least 20 minutes for the bill, and it was finally brought by another server.
I would love to give Madison's more than 3 stars, because all of the appetizers and entrees were spectacular, but unfortunately the service was average at best, and we were actually made to feel quite uncomfortable by our assigned waitress.  And our last taste of the meal was that awful, overpriced dessert (which was not removed from the bill despite our obvious displeasure).
I would recommend Madison's, but stay our of Seria's (I think that was her name) section, and don't waste your money on dessert.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Many thanks to the staff of Madison Grill for their prompt attention to solving things 
Very commendable 
We will continue to enjoy the beautiful Madison Grill",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Went for breakfast around 7:30 AM on a Tuesday. Not many other people in the restaurant.

I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  It came with homefries and a small fruit cup. The eggs benedict was good, the salmon clearly fresh. I thought $15 was a bit much considering the portion size, but the restaurant itself is quite chic and nestled in a boutique hotel. The coffee wasn't very good at all. 

The service was perfect.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"A favorite spot for dessert! The creme brule is amazing as well as the cheesecake. 

One night I remember in particular the waiter was taking a lot of flack from one table because this & that wasn't up to their standard. He handled it with grace & was nothing but pleasant when his time to check on us came up. I know how hard that is to keep your composure when people take their hard day out on you. He was great & even recommended the cheesecake to me.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Came here as part of Edmonton Dining Week. I originally checked out their Dining Week menu online, and upon arrival was pleasantly delighted to see their regular dinner menu to be just as good.
Because of this half of our table ordered the preset 3 course meal, the others decided to try out a selection of appetizers and entrees.

The table shared the dynamite rolls and the arancini balls. The dynamite roll were underwhelming, flavour was not balanced and lacked a sauce. On the other hand, the arancini balls were delicious - the risotto balls were lightly deep fried and stuffed with goat cheese and served with a marinara sauce.

I had the arctic char with crab risotto and brocollini - it was delicious, according to the server they change their accompaniments  with the arctic char dish daily. 

My sister ordered the braised oxtail - as per the server they braise them for 24 hours to soften them ""no knife needed"" and that held true. It was served with cauliflower puree, chanterelle mushrooms and caramelized onion. She also ordered and extra side of the Lobster Mac and Cheese. That was a hit - cheesy penne pasta with the boiled/buttered lobster legs.
Overall everyone was pleased with their meal.

We all shared the dessert that was part of the executive 3 course meal - Bernard Callebaut Chocolate Due Torte - served with some white chantilly cream and berry compote - It was an awesome balance of sweet, salty and spicy. Sweetness from the chocolate, saltiness from the almonds and the berry compote had a after taste hint of cayenne.

The waiter was very attentive and was happy to describe all the dishes and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone for a nice night out or a celebration.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Madison's used to be one of my favourite lunch places pre-kids. Haven't been for a few years and went for a late lunch yesterday. Restaurant decor still immaculate as I remembered. Our server was very friendly and attentive. 

Lunch menu options were abundant. Started with soup of day seafood chowder. Creamy bisque with shrimp cooked to perfection. Pan-seared halibut was nice portion, accompanied with hard and overcooked chips and a side salad. Salmon trio was disappointing - salmon sashimi was really salmon nigiri. Salmon sliced paper thin and put on a 2"" high densely packed rice roll. The fried salmon belly wonton was extra crispy, borderline burnt. Finished off the meal with coffees and shared ""Death by Chocolate"" dessert - carnival food and sloppy plating. Chocolate mousse and torte tasted ok, missing habanero salt. The tempura brownie was disgusting; oily cake with a think batter crust. Sweeting nothing to say the least for this chocolate fiasco. 

Frankly I left disappointed from this meal. I expected more from their food. Nothing like I remembered from my past meals here. Kitchen staff did a great disservice in putting out lackluster and pricey dishes that didn't pair with the ""elegant atmosphere and excellent service"". Not fine dining if the food was subpar. 3 stars only for their service and decor.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
My recent trip was not as good as I have experienced before. The quality of food has dropped down. The service was also not what one would expect from a place like this. Taking away one star from the rating.,eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
Accolades to the staff of Madison and Grill for their prompt attention to an issue. We will gladly enjoy the beautiful Madison Grill once again. Many thanks,eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I was curious to return to Madison's Grill in the Union Bank Inn since the renovation.  To be sure, the new colours do add light without needing any actual light, a plus :-]

We had a bit of an early dinner since 7pm seating was full, however, we were assured we wouldn't be rushed out and we weren't.  We had a nice table for 2 at the windows and from there we started eyeing the menu.

First off, the meals we ordered were quite good and aside a few VERY little things, I must say, this is one of the few places that I hope I can count on to be consistent in ALL its features;  from the friendly and attentive staff to the good food we did have.

I had as an appetizer the Baked Portneuf Brie which was quite good, however, and it is really my first only ""ding"" on my meal; the candied nuts were a bit too much and it would have been more pleasing to the palate to have the bread slices that accompanied the brie toasted.  From there, I ordered, per the recommendation of it being less gamey than the bison, the Hog Wild Boar.  It was VERY good and tender, NOT gamey at all. With our meal, as we do when it is available, we ordered champagne :-]  which also went nicely with the creme brulee, unfortunately, my second little ""ding""; the top was a more burnt than crisp, however, once I got the top off, the ""creme"" was very nice, light and perfect with the last drops of champagne.

I am not ready to give it a 4/5 simply because I would like to return to ""confirm"" this experience.  However, rest assured, I am very confident in recommending Madison's for a lovely and tranquil, AND delicious night out.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"We came here and boy it looked like a fancy place. We ordered 2 oriental appetizer of a slice of a roll of sushi with salmon, Korean hot sauce (ko chu jang) with a deep fried wonton and a smoked salmon on a potato pancake. 
Well, I would have spit out the sushi if there was a can some where. The old old rice coated my mouth and I couldn't answer the inquire of how is it (the sushi) because of the saw dust like feeling in my mouth. As soon as I cut into it I should have known but popped it into my mouth...wrong move! May have taken me easily over a minute and sips of water (couldn't gulp it) until I could speak. 
The potato pancake was old also and tasted oily and not good. The server said he will give us free dessert instead of taking our TWO orders off the bill. 

When in Edmonton eat the steaks as we did not encounter any bad steak place. 

By the way we came for the FIFA women's World Cup!",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Excellent lamb shank and polenta. My guest claims its the best mashed potatoes he's ever had. Arrived early on a Tuesday, and the ambience was very relaxing. Peace and quiet, fantastic service, and of everything we ordered, from seafood starters, to the creme br√ªl√©e dessert, everything was at the very least above average and pleasant to enjoy.
When traveling and you're just looking for an awesome meal to wrap up the day, this place delivered one hundred percent. Not a single element of the meal or service was mediocre or plain average, hence my taking the time to say so here!",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Lunch here was lovely. Quiet setting, especially considering its location on Jasper Avenue. 

The staff treated us warmly and took excellent care of us. I found it a tad overwhelming to be approaches by four different staff members, especially for a business lunch. But as I said, professional and courteous service.

The flatbread was delicious - chicken, pear, caramelized onions, and gorgonzola cheese. Nicely done, Madison Grill. I'll definitely return.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"The food at Madison's Grill is good and the service offered there is friendly, but neither is at the level of excellence demanded by this price point and this kind of environment.  With some small improvements in both, then Madison's Grill would surely deserve all of the praise it so often receives on this site from its enthusiastic boosters.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
This was a treat experiencing Madison's Grill for the first time for Edmonton Dining Week. We got to choose from a couple selections for a three course dinner for $45. The restaurant atmosphere was perfect to unwind from work and catch up with a friend. The service was super friendly and the server had a great sense of humour. Both the server and manager checked in on us after each course of the meal served. The restaurant was clean and the decor was both modern and romantic. I would without a doubt recommend others to try the restaurant out! The food is very flavourful and cooked to perfection; the steak melted in my mouth!! My only wish is that they had more parking for their restaurant specifically being located in busy downtown.,eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
One of my favorites when in downtown Edmonton.  Today we had tomato soup to start- always tasty and it comes with great fresh made crackers. The Little Miss Pretty is mushrooms and pasta. It was rated as only fair - it was slightly acidic and needed more mushrooms.  I asked for the salmon but with vegetables other than Korean as I can't eat chillies. The vegetables were oven roasted carrots and cauliflower with potatoes and crimini mushrooms - excellent. The salmon was just right moist.,eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I've been to Madison's more in the last month than I have since it opened.  I remember giving it a try when it was still new, and found that the menu read really well, full of very tempting and unique sounding combinations, but the meal never met the promise of those descriptions. A great chef may have planned the menu, or a great writer wrote it, but it seemed that neither stayed on to ensure their vision made it to the table.

More recently I've been there quite a few times for work, both a breakfast and several lunches.  Sadly they didn't impress at breakfast, my basted eggs came sunny-side up, with the undercooked snot that is the reason I avoid ordering that style. They also gave me hash browns, which were easy enough to avoid eating, but were not what I ordered when I asked for eggs and toast. They didn't have either soy or almond milk for my coffee, which I know can be a stretch for smaller establishments to have on hand, but if you are going for superior service you should be prepared to accommodate guests avoiding dairy. One of my breakfast companions had the eggs benedict. They said it was good, but a grey hollandaise isn't particularly appetizing looking.

Lunch fortunately has been much much better.  They were able to accommodate a group that was much larger than our reservation and this time the menu read less inspiring than the tastes that were a delightful surprise.  The Gull Valley tomato salad is amazing, with arugula, 3 or 4 varieties of tomato, goat cheese and a stunning smoky sweet onion relish that I couldn't stop adding to every bite.  The soups I've tried suffered from not meeting the promise that the servers gave from exquisite descriptions (the writer must be on staff), but were ok, just not so great that  I needed to devour them like that salad. other dishes I've sampled have been very good, and I've put this place back onto my lunch list.

My rating is lunch only, as this is my main reason for coming here.  I'd only give them 2 stars for breakfast.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Just enjoyed a lovely dinner, lovely ambiance. Service was impeccable. We weren't enjoying the wine we selected ( no fault of the restaurant, we just did not select the right one for our palate) and our server noticed we didn't seem to be enjoying it, and without us even mentioning anything he immediately offered to replace our selection with a different wine. The Arctic Char was delicious as was the rissoto. We had a lovely, relaxing and delicious meal, can't say enough about the service. Excellent.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"A group of us came to Madison's Grill for a birthday celebration - we had such a great time! The food was fantastic and the servers were very attentive and answered all of our questions. I had never eaten here before, but I can't wait to go back!",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
Formal dinner was great. Steak with flavorful sauce. Topped with a filling caramel br√ªl√©e . Service was good but be aware of paid parking if. No street parking available. Their mc/debit machine broke down so they went old school or had to tell patrons to go across the street to use an atm. Not fun after having a great full 3 course dinner with wine :). Service was great otherwise,eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Union Bank Inn and had supper/breakfast at Madison's for our 10th Anniversary. Our supper service was very good however it was a very long wait between courses even by fine dining standards. Our food was satisfactory when it came out, however my husbands filet was cooked medium-medium well rather than medium rare. I had duck and while it was cooked nicely, both the duck and risotto were way over seasoned in my opinion. I then had earl grey creme br√ªl√©e and the flavour was good but the texture was quite grainy. In my opinion, it was substandard for a $200 supper with a bottle of wine. 

We then stayed the night and came down for breakfast in the morning as it was included with our hotel. The service was absolutely terrible. A server brought us our coffee, took our order, and then was not seen again until our food came out 1/2 hour later, then again was not seen at all. We were supposed to wait to sign a receipt and we finally got up and left. The food was ok. I had a Caprese sandwich and it was very bland. My husband had salmon eggs Benedict and while it tasted ok, he struggled with and upset stomach most of the afternoon. 

While we did end up enjoying our stay, the restaurant was not worth the price tag.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Excellent resturant. Great food. Amazing menu. Great taste, never had anything there which did not taste good. Also have a nice dining hall for meetings. Great service. Only thing missing is free parking. Have to pay for parking at the back of the building. Highly recommended if u like high end dining.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I always wanted to check out some of the high-end restaurants downtown and thanks to program like downtown dinning week I was able to do so without spending a fortune.  So we had a girl's night out and Madison's Grill was my first stop.  When I first walked in, was surprised how small it was.  It was cozy and intimate.  Perfect for date night or party of four with friends.  I was greeted right away.  Coat checked and shown to my table.  My waiter was Kevin K.  We started with Cosmos.  My glass was a little short (not as full as it should have been) but that didn't damper my excitement.  My appetizer was Duet of Pork which is hickory smoked jowl with braised cheek paired with spicy blackberry gastric & chipotle tossed frisee.  It was delicious! The flavor's just exploded in my mouth.  Paired with the wine Kevin K. suggested just made it even better.  For the Main course I had the Black Garlic Rested Striploin.  Paprika Lemon Roasted Creamers, Confit Baby Carrots & Pomegranate Molasses.  My steak was cooked perfect (medium rare) and very tasty.  My Carrots?  Well, let's just say I HATE carrots, BUT I ate these ones.  Absolutely scrumptious!  Hats off the chief!  My mother will love you because you got me to eat carrots.  For dessert we had the Rosemary Olive Oil Cake with Macerated Berries, Vanilla Ice cream, Basil Snow & Lavender Syrup.  My friends love it.  As for me it was ok.  The flavors just wasn't a wow factor for me.   Kevin K. our waiter, did an awesome job.   We never had to look for him, he was always there keeping our glasses full and our party happy.   All in all it was a good night.  Great service (Kevin K; awesome job), good food and atmosphere.  Madison is now on my list of favs to go to.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Came here most recently as part of the Downtown Dining week event, but I've been here a few times prior.  

Madison's Grill is located inside the Union Bank Inn, which is easily spotted on Jasper Ave.  That being said, because it's Jasper Ave, parking is a pain.  No free parking available, unless you find a meter outside the meter hours.  

Service is always prompt and impeccable, and I haven't had a bad meal here yet.  Food tastes great and presented well.  Good pace for plates coming out, and our server asked us whether we needed things picked up or slowed down.  

Good ambience if you're looking for a nice restaurant for a romantic meal for two.   

Couple of downsides: the washrooms are located in the basement (basements of old buildings always creep me out), and they don't make it a usual practice to ask whether you are splitting a bill when dining with friends, instead, they give you one total bill.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Our server was Todd and he was on top of his game. He knew the menu well and made great suggestions. We did go on a late Sunday night so it was very quite.

We had the tuna which was done perfect, spinach salad, the lamb and tenderloin. Their wasn't a part of the meal that wasn't off. Dessert I had the apple tart and it was bang on and cooked fresh.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Possibly the best eggs benedict we have had in Edmonton. Surprisingly inexpensive brunch menu, pleasant and attentive service, lovely decor. It's divine! Wish Edmonton had more eateries like this one.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"Wow, what an amazing experience. I came here for downtown dining week just before all the major shutdowns. We were seated promptly and our coats were checked. The atmosphere was posh with white linen table cloths and napkins. The hostess, server and (I can only assume) the manager were all very polite, warm and accommodating. We had a lovely 2 course meal with complementary sparkling water. The soup was a roasted tomato soup with a cream topping. So delicious, I would have licked the plate if it wasn't such a swanky place. And the pasta was just scrumptious. Mushrooms, chicken and black truffle in a cream sauce. There were many sighs of contentment during this meal. The literal cherry on top at the end was a delicious complementary chocolate covered cherry, obviously makdein house. Stellar service and exceptional food. I can't wait until we can dine in house again.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"We stayed at the Union Bank inn and had a couple meals at Madison's.   For being a higher end restaurant It was right up there with being one of the better experiences in this class of dining experience.  

We didn't arrive during peak times so it wasn't busy for us which adds to my experience of the food being extremely quick but very good.   Service was polite and friendly.  The prices were on par with other places of similar class.  Decor was nice. 

I'm a vegetarian (vegan at home) and usually restaurants of this scale don't carter to me.   Sometimes they are willing to ""whip"" something up for me because it's not on the menu and generally get whatever the chief will make me which isn't always to my taste and sometimes they offer to serve me a double portion of salad with most of the distinguishing features missing.  Either way I rarely consider that an easy or special dining experience and sometimes open food at a place of this scale can be extremely expensive because they charge whatever they want when the bill shows up.   Madison's has at least one suitable and good choice per menu which always pleases me because I can eat multiple courses with my companion and feel like a normal customer. 

I particularly liked the chocolate tasting plate for dessert (dinner menu).  The price was reasonable ($10) and portions were decent for ""tastes"" so it felt like I had 3 very good desserts.",eJFw8xWcqyAno0SclR4uzg
"I did not ever in my life think I would be writing a review on a pizza place, but this is worth it. 

Always easy online or telephone ordering, no problem finding our apparently difficult to find address, the staff is always super friendly and very courteous and professional.

The other big pizza places in the city have given us the exact opposite experience, so this is refreshing.",fgIAN_Y-hgPq6E-MPZk8vg

Well, I know I've mentioned that Red Brick was one of the two places they actually really like eating pizza from; the other place is Panago Pizza.  The pizza is pretty tasty and I love the fact that they have a lot to choose from.  If you ask my nieces which pizza they like best one would say cheese and the other would say pepperoni.  I love the fact that Panago lets you split the pizza into two different flavors and there is a special some times so it's cheaper.  If you ask my brother which pizza he likes the best he would probably say the Tropical Hawaiian or the BBQ Chicken; these are both my favorites also.  Another great tasting pizza is the Buffalo Chicken.  If you are a veggie lover then I suggest picking up the Garden Veggie.  Their wings are okay, I've had better, but I really like their Rosemary garlic breadsticks.  

Their prices are pretty decent and you get dips with your pizza; my nieces think this is the best part of the deal; they go crazy with the dip!  The staff is really great; I had placed an order over the phone for a pick up and when I got to the place to pick up my pizza they informed me know about the special that was on (the cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza slip on one pizza) and that they miss charged me.  I was happy to find out that I only had to spend just over $10 for a dinner for three instead of about $14.",fgIAN_Y-hgPq6E-MPZk8vg
They are honey garlic and salt and peper chicken wings. So disappointed! They all ocer cooked and even has the bitter taste. The worst chicken wings i ever had!,fgIAN_Y-hgPq6E-MPZk8vg
"My husband and I joke every single time we go to this panago (which is a lot) that we NEED to write a Yelp review about it. 
They are the nicest, most efficient employees I have ever seen. I don't know who is managing this place but WOW, so many companies could take a page from their book. They all seem happy to be there, but they are so professional. A year after moving to this area it's all the same employees so they obviously like working there. 
I've been to dozens of panago locations all over Canada and this is by far the best and most consistent.",fgIAN_Y-hgPq6E-MPZk8vg
"Really good pizza, plenty of choice and super affordable!

You can call ahead to place your order and pick up (which means If im shopping in Save on Foods I can call and pick it up once im done shopping)
You can stop in and have it made while you wait (and they are super quick!) 
OR you can get it delivered (my favorite option - literally took them 15 minutes from us calling them to have it made and delivered to our door!)

My favorite lately is the new BLT pizza.....soooo good!",fgIAN_Y-hgPq6E-MPZk8vg
Very delicious toppings with a huge varieties. They have vegan pepperoni and gluten free toppings and sauces.,fgIAN_Y-hgPq6E-MPZk8vg
"I normally book from Panago downtown.

However, had friends over this weekend with kids and wanted something quick local and filling. Pizza it was.

The staff member on the phone didn't make suggestions for the amount of people or suggestions on different crust flavours etc. When the order was delivered it was incorrect and by the time they  came with the right pizza it was cold.",fgIAN_Y-hgPq6E-MPZk8vg
"My go to place for oxtail . It's so good , wish they had one on the North  side  if Edmonton . There jerk chicken is good too . I think Wednesday they have a special on jerk",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Stopped in on a whim and ordered a Jamaican patty and a small oxtail meal, based on the owner's recommendation. Both came to just over $18 and was a lot of food.

The patty dough was a bit thick, but was flaky and crispy. The meat filling had great flavour - I just wish there was more of it.

The meal came with a dumpling - kind of like a large, dense timbit that isn't as sweet. The salad was a bit of mix with a creamy mayo - excellent to cut the spice if you can't handle it. A generous portion of rice & beans was the bed for the oxtail. Lots of flavour and meat - I quite enjoyed it. 

Had a nice conversation with the owner while I waited - she's been doing this for a long time and it showed in her food. I'd love to come back to try more items! I noticed the menu advertised Sunday brunch - very curious about that!",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Best jerk chicken I've come across, and their beef patties cannot be beaten.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"A simple place that yields the best comfort food you'll ever have.
I always order the oxtail and their beef patties. The sauce is delicious, and if you order this, you BETTER be sucking them bones because that's where all the flavour is.
Pretty pricey but it takes a long ass time to make the stews as delicious as they are.

Their food is just as good if you ever catch their food truck and don't forget to grab a Ting or Ginger Beer!",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"I can't believe we've never been here before. Lived in Millwoods my whole life and we love Jamaican food (usually attempt to make at home).

Ordered:
Jamaican Patties
Chicken Stew
Jerk Chicken
Dumplings


Everything was amazing!  We blew through it so fast. The jerk chicken was flavorful and spicy but not too spicy for those that don't like heat. Chicken stew was incredible, a little sweet and hot, tons of flavor. Both came with rice and salad. I pushed the beans to the side but my husband ate them allllll! 
The patties were the best part. Try them, you won't be disappointed.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"I ordered a jerked whole chicken before opening time and went to pick it up shortly after they opened. I got two small lunch boxes of chicken costing $33.00
It was very very dry inside and out; I couldn't eat it. I've been eating jerked chicken for about 25 years so I know what it's supposed to taste like. I'm not one to complain about food then re-order. So I just left it at that.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Wednesday's are my new favourite day lol why? Because of JERK CHICKEN for $9.99, what a deal. Their portions are huge and so much flavour. I love the sauce that comes with the jerk chicken *drool* and not only that you get rice and chicken, it also comes with a house made coleslaw and this deep fried dough ( not sure what its called, but it's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside) 

Another must try is their ox tail AND their beef patties.  Also if you love spicy, be sure to add some of their Habanero Calypso sauce",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"We live in California but come to visit family in Edmonton every few years. We always come here and order jerk chicken, oxtail, and curry chicken roti. It is to die for! I crave it for months after I leave. Definitely the BEST!",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"If you're a fan of Caribbean food, they cook up a mean chicken curry  and Ital roti here. Ital is vegetarian, and the cook changes the recipe up each time, depending on which veggies she's got in her fridge. 

The shop's small and simple, with a counter, kitchen and drink case. Nothing special, really. It's all about the food here - and what they do, they do well! 

The roti shells are fantastic - full of delicious dhal puri - and I love the Champagne cola. It's the perfect bevy for a hot and spicy roti if you're not into mango juice or ginger beer. I've driven all the way across town through rush hour just to sate my craving. I haven't tasted a roti anywhere in Canada this good since I lived in Toronto and ate at Bacchus Roti Shop at Queen & Dufferin. They've mastered the roti - but this is as close as I've gotten, here in E-town.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Irie Foods is a little Jamaican restaurant in a Millwoods strip mall. There's only a few tables to sit down at, and when I stopped here for lunch (about 1pm) the restaurant was pretty full. That was okay because I was just getting some beef patties to go. I haven't been to Jamaica so I'm certainly not an expert in Jamaican food, but these beef patties were quite good. The crust was flaky, and there was a good amount of spice in the filling. They were a bit greasy and messy to eat, but it seems like that would be pretty common with this dish. It was quite tasty, and two beef patties was more than I needed. The order came in pretty quick, and the lady who took my order was friendly. I'm not often in this area of the city, but next time I am I might stop back at Irie Foods to try something else on the menu.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"The food was great and the service wasn't bad either. Hubby got a chicken roti and I got the jerk chicken meal. If you're in the Millwoods area and want a taste of the West Indies, definitely drop by!",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"This place is an old, long-term hidden Millwoods gem!
Best jerk chicken in town; always amazing and so full of flavor.
The staff are friendly and efficient, never a long wait. And you can even take it to go and expect the taste to still be fresh when you get home.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Small storefront in Millwoods with about 6 tables, but it isn't exactly a place made for dine in.  
Service was without a smile, chose the curried chicken roti from the small menu.  Food appeared quickly, I was summoned back up to the counter to get my food in the styrofoam container and was shown where the plastic cutlery was.  
Roti was excellent, salad was crunchy, chicken curry was a bit salty.  Overall, it's just ok, so, onward I go to the next Caribbean place on my list in an effort to find the best place in Edmonton for one of my favorite cuisines.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
I grew up eating Jamaican food at home.  This is some of the best jerk chicken I've had the privilege to enjoy.  The paties are pretty good too.,ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"An update to this old review. I know live on the south side and in respect to all others, this is the best roti in town. I still wish they did the roti with the curried chicken, potatoes, chickpeas,etc in the roti wrapped up,etc. But that is trivial and I'm just happy to have some West Indian restaurant is consistently operating. Love Irie Foods!",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"It has been about 10 years since I was last at Irie Foods. In that time a lot has changed and a lot hasn't changed. Last time I was there the food was cooked when ordered and tasty, the staff was friendly, and the setting was fresh.
Unfortunately this time the food was precooked and not overly exciting, the staff were not unfriendly, and the setting is certainly not fresh.
I do not feel we received value for money.
Perhaps their Jerk Chicken Wednesdays for $9.95 might be better value for money, but it certainly didn't feel that is what we got yesterday.
I was disappointed with my experience and will not be returning.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Jamaican cuisine is hands down my favourite ethnic food.  The simplicity of the dishes and the depth of flavours are the reasons why I can consume it everyday for the rest of my life and not get bored of it.  Coming from Toronto where Caribbean restaurants are plentiful, I can say with a straight face that Irie Foods is on par with some of the best from my hometown.

I usually order the curry goat combo which comes with a side of fluffy rice & peas, vinaigrette iceberg lettuce salad, or creamy coleslaw and a piece of dumpling.  I'm not really a fan of roti as a side because I don't feel I get my money's worth.  Portion sizes took me by surprise.  The small size takeout is equivalent to most large takeout trays in back home.  This place also offers seating for its patrons unlike most in Toronto.   The decor is simple and the lobby and washrooms look clean.  Yes the menu items are a bit pricey but we live in Alberta where cost of food is a bit higher than most provinces.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Irie Foods will always have a special place in my heart. I grew up around this area an irie was mandatory every Wednesday for the jerk chicken special. Everything about this dish is amazing from the classic Togo box they serve it in, the little salad with the dressing the dumpling an of course the rice an beans mix with the jerk chicken on top. Every time I come here it brings joy to my little heart an my stomach. I'll always keep coming back here as long as they keep pumping out the amazing food. I guess you can order online via door dash.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"One of my favourite places to stop for lunch in the South. I get the Jerk Chicken and its the best ever. The portions are large and your licking your plate clean. Also get the beef patty I think it is, cant remember. Even that was fantastic so good it wiped my memory. You are so full after you finished your meal. The staff is super friendly, love to talk.  Its very inviting. The issue is it is by two highschools so it can get pretty packed. If you can go a little early I would recommend it.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"So here I come from big city Toronto by way of Barbados West Indies, yearning for some straight from the island foods... I LOVE Ital Food, proper Rastafarian cuisine, but rarely can find it.  Now I KNOW there are other West Indian people living in Edmonton, so I utilized yelp to find a good place to eat. The searches lead me to this place, Irie Foods, located in Millwoods. Which, from what I can tell from the area, makes sense.

Today the wife (who is Guyanese descent) and myself drop all the way to Millwoods to specifically eat at this place. We live in the NW of Edmonton, so it was a little hop, skip and a jump to the place.

Irie Foods is located in a small plaza strip with businesses like: Servus Credit Union, KFC, 7/11 Gas Station and a few other places. It is a very quaint/small place with only a few tables and chairs.  For those of you who might have never visited the Caribbean before, it's vibe/decor is straight outta the islands. Very basic place with white walls and with generic island advertisements. The front order counter has a display case with many Reggae/Dancehall/Soca cds for purchase and has a fridge with a few examples of drinks (Grace Sodas, Coke, Pepsi,etc) They have a single bathroom for men & women to use, please remember to leave the door open after you leave it.

As for the food, both my wife and I picked the Curry Chicken Roti. It wasn't Ital Food, as Ital Food is typically vegetarian based and contains zero meat. The woman who took our order was VERY nice and greeted us with a smile and nice small talk, during the taking of our order. After she took our order she disappeared to the back, where we saw a man moving around there doing something.

The wife and I took a seat to wait while the meal was prepared, listening to the music they were playing. At this time two other guys came in and wanted to place an order.  Which they did after the woman returned from the back with our order. We paid and thanked her for the service, as she began to serve the two gentlemen.

We opted to not sit in the establishment, as it was a nice bright and sunny day. So we picked up a couple drinks and parked across the street in the school parking lot. We figured it was more enjoyable/private this way, compared to sitting in the place.

The food comes to you in take-out form, so we broke out the food napkins and began to eat. The roti was more like Jamaican rotis, the major difference is that it comes deconstructed. This means the meat and sauce,etc are not in the actual roti. The roti was rolled up and placed on one side, and the curry chicken roti mixture was placed in a plastic container on the other side. This is different compared to most rotis I have ate, as they have ALWAYS come constructed with the chicken and stuffing inside the roti. ie: like a completely enclosed wrap.

The food was DELICIOUS though. It came with a deep fried bread ball, which was done perfectly, the coleslaw was also great. The curry chicken tasted amazing and was seasoned perfectly. The roti wraps were standard roti wraps and were tasty.  However my only complaints are: A) Wish there was more curry chicken, B) If the chicken was de-boned and C) wish the curry chicken was actually put INTO the roti wrap and served that way. Especially since we paid $14 per roti, which seems a bit steep for me, but I am sure they have their reasons. Most likely because its a specialty food place and not many people are coming in for the ""exotic food"" option here in Edmonton.

Would I go back to eat there? Only if I was actually in the area for some reason, like going to the movies or going to Edmonton South Common to the outlets,etc. Perhaps their other options on the menu might be better, although I'm not a fan of ox-tail,etc. Maybe if I ask nicely, she could whip me up some good proper ital food. As contrary to the 2010 review by Jennifer P. Irie Foods does not list a single ""ital roti"" on the menu.

Honestly I've been begging my mother to send me a proper roti recipe,etc. Guess I just have to work harder at getting her to send me the info. That or she has to make a bunch and send them to me over night express. That and some of her amazing mac pie.

PS: I find it ironic that in writing this I scroll to the ""Have Additional Tips On This Business"" section and it asks about ""Are these photos helpful"" and it shows how a roti is SUPPOSE to be made and looks nothing like we received. Comical.",ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
It's difficult to find Jamaican food in the city so making the drive to millwoods is a monthly route for us lol. It's really nice being able to get jerk chicken for such an inexpensive price too,ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
Had great ox-tail!! Most definitely would recommend for your Edmonton's best yard food.,ivqoS7vO__2-rerN_IjZmA
"Great sushi, bit if an odd environment that is a bit old and outdated and everyone is very close together. The food came fast but wasn't as good as I had been led to believe, especially for the price. The Sashimi was very fresh and a cool variety plate that our server, well the one who dropped it off, not sure we had a specific one, couldn't explain.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Great place to have real Japanese food. Nabe udon is the best! Great owner and great staff. Always busy so make sure to have an appointment if you have time to wait..,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"I travel quite a bit for work and I always seek out the hole in the wall places that always seem to hit the mark. This is definitely one of them. The fish was fresh, the warm sake was warm, and the staff was friendly. I also had the pleasure of trying a grilled shrimp head instead of the usual fried. I am a fan!! The head had all the flavor with no grease. I will definitely return the next time I am in Edmonton!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"My usual sushi spot is on Whyte, but with Sushi Wasabi closer to home and the winter weather so cold, we decided to give this place a try.

I have driven past this place many times so it was nice to finally stop in for dinner.  I was surprised at how busy it was.  Sure it was during the xmas holidays, but it was also a monday night - and the joint was almost filled to capacity.  

The waitress was super friendly and attentive which was great.  We ordered what we thought would be enough, but after the initial meal added another round - so was great that she was on top of it.

The rice was well done - a bit sticky and perfect for rolls.  The fish was flavourful, tasty and fresh.  I'd say it was a bit pricey, but if you need a sushi fix and on the southside, it is well worth checking out Sushi Wasabi.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"A little hole in the wall sushi joint. Salmon sashimi was great. Tuna sashimi was awful.
I've definitely been to better sushi places in Edmonton (better bang for your buck as well)
If you want good Salmon sashimi I say go hard. The Bento box is a rip off and almost everywhere on the menu says ""No substitutions"" which I've never had an issue with any where else.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"I chose Sushi Wasabi for my boyfriend's birthday after reading rave reviews. As an afterthought, I made a reservation... I'm glad I did.  This place is always pretty packed when I go here & it has a really tiny waiting area.  In fact, the entire restaurant is pretty small.  They have a great selection of fish with reasonable prices and everything is really fresh.  We always get the prerequisite tempura which is also very delicious.  My only complaint is the last time we were there, the tempura arrived last and took quite awhile to come.  They bring in specials regularly... last time we tried to the bluefin tuna & it was quite the treat  - a little heavy on the wasabi in the middle but some might like that. Would definitely recommend this place but would recommend making reservations, lest you get stuck waiting a long time.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"This is a great little place to go get some quality sushi!
The venue is small and fairly active, so you may want to call in advance to book a seat as it often gets full.

The sushi is delicious, and you can tell they care about the quality of the fish they are serving you.  The food is always fresh and delivered within a reasonable amount of time. If you sit at the bar you can watch them make it right in front of you! 

The price is decent and you get a good amount for what you pay for. They are never cheap with the size of their servings.  

The service is top notch. It is a family run restaurant, and these people care about their customers. 

Overall, if you love Sushi, this is the place to go in Edmonton.

Their lunch hours are variable and they are always closed on Mondays, generally I go there for dinner for a safe bet that they will be open.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"All and all we had a decent experience however there were a couple of things that I wasn't happy with. I am not a health freak but I do try to avoid deep fried foods. Their bento box includes massive pieces of tempura and they refuse to substitute. That's a no no as far as I'm concerned. 

About 80 minutes into our meal the server approached us and very politely requested that we wrap things up as they needed our table. That's a huge no no.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Visited sushi wasabi for a special occasion. This is a moms and pops kind of shop, very obviously family run. The decor is very unassuming and slightly on the side of an aging joint.

The quality is top notch and very fresh although the prices are shockingly high. The value is slightly lower than that of other quality sushi restaurants although this is made up in the freshness of the seafood. 

Service is average and we would consider visiting again but only if in the neighborhood. Would not recommend for special occasions if only for the lack of ambiance.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"So we came here on a whim around 7pm on a Thursday evening and because we didn't have a reservation we wound up sitting at the bar.  This place is hopping - make reservations!

The bar was totally fine and service was super fast and friendly.  The food is great value for what you pay for and their sashimi was fantastic!  Their rolls are your basic sushi rolls, no attempts at recreating new/modernized rolls. The veggies were all super fresh too.  Our teapot was always full so that was really nice too - despite how busy they were they were def taking care of their customers.

Totally worth checking out!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Based on the outside I thought this place was going to be a greasy spoon, but when I went inside I was wrong. This restaurant is tiny but the inside is very modern, nicely decorated, well lit and the space is utilized well enough to still provide privacy for diners. The customer service is good and so was the food. Sushi Wasabi isn't that bad but it wouldn't be my first pick for Japanese food. If I happened to be in the neighborhood and was hungry, I would dine here because it does have reasonable prices.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Amazing! I lived in Japan for a number of years and this place is the closest you can get to authentic Japanese food in Edmonton. Anyone who thinks otherwise has probably never lived in Japan or wants Westernised Japanese food. It is pricey but worth it.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"As I sit on my couch, a little more than 12 hours after consuming a simple meal of assorted tempura, spicy octopus maki and spicy tuna maki with my husband, my insides are expressing displeasure and defiance after ingesting this meal.
The place is quaint, clean, and our waitress was very friendly.  We requested to ""start"" with the assorted tempura....didn't happen.  The rolls were brought out first and my husband made the comment ""boy, do these ever smell fishy.""  Granted we were in a sushi restaurant, fish isn't supposed to smell as fishy as it did, indicating to me that it may not have been as fresh as it should be for sushi.  We ate it anyways...and I'm sure the spices in the mix camouflaged any distaste I would have otherwise experienced.
The tempura arrived when we were already halfway through our makis, but whatever, it arrived hot.  The shrimp tempura could have been cooked slightly longer as it wasn't very crispy and almost a bit soggy.  The oil needed to be changed as well...  I was up a lot in the night with reflux and heartburn from the tempura, something which I rarely ever have
For drinks, I had green tea and my husband had the hot sake.
Unfortunately, we will not be returning to this restaurant.
I wish I could have given it a better review, but I'd rather be honest than not...",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"I haven't found a time to go to Sushi Wasabi and was feeing odd that they only opens for a few hours each day for dinner. I didn't know that we needed to make reservations when I walked in on a Sunday night.
The waitress, which I assume was also the owner, met me in the front. She told me that I had an hour to eat  if I wanted to stay before the next reservation. She seemed uninterested in my desire to eat here....
I consulted with my sister and we agreed that we will just try a few items on the menu to see how good there sushi is and if it's good, we'll come back next time.
This Japanese restaurant is small, tight and had some really cute d√©cor around.
We were quickly seated by a new waitress. She didn't really know what to recommend us and didn't know how to engage in conversation with us.
We quickly decided on a few rolls: spicy tuna rolls, avocado & shitake rolls, spicy octopus rolls and salmon maki. 
The fish tasted really fresh and really good.  The rice was a good texture and consistency. We were both impressed by how delicious the rolls were that it brought down the subtle annoyance of having only one hour to eat....
We took a huge chunk of Wasabi and was over the top surprised that it wasn't water down. We had a good spicy kick up our nose and was very happy that it happen. Boss man came around to fill up our water regularly. 
Sushi Wasabi definitely peaked my interest and I will for sure come back here to try the other items on the menu.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Arguably one of the best sushi restaurants in Edmonton, if not Alberta, this tiny hole in the wall is ridiculously popular. MAKE A RESERVATION. (there, I said it loudly.)
A family run business, the service is friendly and efficient, always with a smile.

I first tasted their sushi when they were a takeaway joint in an ill fated Asian Mall in Old Strathcona  many long dark years ago. It was amazing then, and remains so today. The move to a larger venue did not diminish the quality, but it is high time they moved to bigger quarters, yet again.

My biggest complaint is that it can get pretty cramped in there on any given night, and this is also the reason one must make reservations to get in.
The popularity has overwhelmed the seating capacity.

That complaint out of the way, the food is fabulous. Every time I have been in I have ordered something different, and each dish is as good as the last.

If you are a lover of good Japanese cuisine, Sushi Wasabi is for you.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Sushi Wasabi is a small restaurant tucked away in a busy strip mall on 111 street. They are not currently open for dine-in service but takeout is still a great option. We were able to walk-in and place an order for pickup within 30 minutes on a weekday evening.

They offer quite a few traditional vegetarian options. My favourite is their yam tempura roll which is flavourful and perfectly crispy. All of their rolls are fresh and tasty. The rice is never crumbly.

Sushi Wasabi is probably my favourite sushi spot on the southside of the river. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for some delicious handmade sushi.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Sushi Wasabi is tied for best sushi in Edmonton in my books.  I went there tonight with my family for dinner and had a fantastic experience.  The restaurant is small, so make sure you call ahead to book a table. (we called 45 minutes before getting there and they held us a table)

The highlights of our meal were the tempura, it was light and fluffy but still crisp and not greasy which was awesome.  The avocado salmon roll was amazing.  My personal favorite is the Dynamite Roll no matter where we go, but at Wasabi sushi it perfectly pairs their amazing tempura with my favorite roll.

I am also a wasabi guy, so let me tell you that their Wasabi is amazingly flavourful without being unnecessarily spicy. 

If you get the chance to go to Wasabi for sushi I highly recommend it, I drove nearly 100 blocks to get there, right past a couple of other sushi restaurants and think you should do the same.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Just moved to Edmonton after living in San Francisco Bay Area for 4 years. Was looking for some good sushi hat might compare, but was skeptical. After a bit of research (reddit mostly), tried this place out. It did not disappoint. Japanese-owned. Wow best sushi rice I've had... ever? Great tasting fish. 
We had: tekka don w/ tuna, veggie and shrimp tempura, hamachi & toro nigiri, and #7 combo. 
No complaints all around. Definitely will be back.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
This is a great place for sushi. It's rather small so I'd recommend reserving if you can. We order the sushi combination for $50 and the green bean tempura. This was a lot of food so I'd recommend just getting the combination plate. All the sushi was good except the octopus. I won't be ordering that again!,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Everybody has a favorite sushi place in Edmonton and Sushi Wasabi is one of mine. New sushi restaurants can pop up here and there but when it comes down to it, it's hard to beat favorites for a reason! Stellar food (in this case, fresh fish), good speedy service, family-owned, are just the few things I look for in restaurants. Sadly enough, those are the ones that I don't actually post a lot about. They're the restaurants that don't have a lot a hype and are easily missed on big lists, such as Avenue's Best Restaurants, or the like. So this will save me from answering the common question, ""What's your favorite sushi place in Edmonton?"" Sushi Wasabi for nigiri sushi and sashimi. Ichiban if I'm feeling like eating rolls... that post will come eventually.

There's been only one time Joe and I were seated at the bar. I wish I was brave enough to strike up a conversation with the seasoned staff behind the counter but I never did. Maybe one day if they're not busy... which is almost never. But one day!

The food is fantastic. Obviously. On our last visit, Joe had a chirashi bowl, which means ""scattered"" bowl. A rice bowl topped with whatever the chef has for the day, always including sashimi and fish roe. That day was a surf clam, octopus, tuna and salmon sashimi, ebi shrimp, tamago (egg), mushrooms and cucumbers! An awesome assortment for the seafood lover.

My lunch, although not as colorful and impressive as Joe's, was just as good though. I absolutely need salmon whenever I eat sushi, either in a hosomaki form like pictured, or in nigiri form. Last week I had a hankering for hosomaki and a couple pieces of hamachi (Japanese amberjack or yellowtail) nigiri. Mmm, both so buttery and creamy. I can eat this for days. If you're not a fan of wasabi, watch out for their nigiri pieces, there's wasabi in between the sashimi and rice. You're at Sushi Wasabi!

And there you have it! My favorite sushi place for sushi and sashimi. It's a small space so make sure you reserve a table during peak hours and especially on Fridays and weekends. My coworker's favorite is their California Roll (are you thinking, whaaaat?) but theirs has grapefruit in it and the larger variety is the size of a hockey puck! I'm not the biggest fan of that particular roll but definitely something to try if you haven't yet. Parking is available in the lot. Go check it out!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"The best sushi place I've found in Edmonton so far. I have been three times and never had anything I wouldn't call delicious. The maki, nigiri, and sashimi are all excellent. And the place has the exact vibe you want from a sushi joint. Small, friendly, and a sushi chef that looks like he's been doing it right for decades.

The prices are a little high, although not out of line for what sushi goes for in Edmonton. And while I like the small restaurant vibe, it can make getting in for dinner a challenge. But in terms of quality and taste, this place can't be matched in Edmonton.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Best sushi ever! I went there for my bday and I had amazing food/service. I was so happy I bought a grift certificate for my boyfriend's parents.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Been going here for over 10years and always happy with the friendly service and excellent food. Classically trained in Japan, the chef and his family return to Japan every year to visit family and immerse themselves in the culinary scene. So if you're looking for authenticity factor, check that off your list! Always give the specials menu an eyeball as theres always a myriad of succulent delicious dishes to be found on it and once they sell out for the night, you'll have to wait until it shows up on the special seasonal menu again. 

Highlights include: expertly balanced beef tetaki, sweet raw scallops, succulent sauced unagi/salt water eel, smokey freshwater eel, salmon Toro- buttery taste with a crisp texture; Tuna Toro -whats known as one of the most sought after fish in Japan- melt in your mouth buttery goodness. Cooked highlights include their flavor packed shrimp tempura uramaki, gargantuan nebayaki udon chock full of veges, various seafood swimming in a delectable unami filled broth; chicken karaage redolent with ginger infused crispy batter; whole grilled squid that is perfectly cooked over coals.

It's a very small and cozy restaurant, so make sure you make reservations in advance to avoid being disappointed!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Good sushi but I've never waited so long for food. It took an hour and fifteen minutes after being seated to receive any food, and we had a reservation. They also forgot some of our order and we had to wait again while one person at our table had no food for so long. We were close to walking out and many people came and went with take out orders. Seems like the priority went to take out and not the people who were sitting and waiting and made reservations. No apologies from the staff either. Going here was an annual family tradition so we'll probably pick somewhere new next time or do the take out. Too bad, it was pretty yummy.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Sushi Wasabi is family owned and the place to find the freshest sushi and sashimi here in Edmonton. It is also one of the priciest but that's what you get for good quality. The location is small so be sure to call ahead of time to book a reservation if necessary. It also  looks a little old and run down from the outside. 

On my most recent trip, we ordered the assorted sashimi dish, beef tataki, chop chop sushi, spicy tuna rolls, the salmon don and chicken karaage (not pictured). All the sashimi tasted rich and fresh. Beef tataki was delicious, gave you a decent amount of slices and wasn't overly salty. Overall a very tasty authentic Japanese meal. The bill came out to be around $100 that was split between two people. 

Don't expect to come here for a large variety of rolls or western fusion items here. This place is better for simple nigiri, maki rolls and sashimi.. but they are delicious!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
The best in the city. Surfclam tataki and sankai maki are amazing.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"I went here a while back in December. Sushi wasabi is a the right place to go if you want authentic sushi. Unfortunately thought, since this place is very authentic there is not many unique choices of maki rolls to choose from. For example, like dragon rolls, deep fried rolls, etc. I love sushi is the place to go if you want more unique rolls, which is also not authentic. However thought, the sashimi was very fresh and tasted better than most sushi restaurants I've been to. I enjoyed the tempura rolls the most, I recommend it. The reason I'm giving this a 4/5 is because although the food is very fresh and authentic, it does not have many of the deep fried rolls and variety of sushi I could choose from.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"This restaurant was only opened for takeout only, and sometimes that's the way to go! With an immense sushi craving, I really wanted to like this place more. I read reviews of how the sushi was good quality, and I definitely feel like that was somewhat true! There was no fishy taste with the sushi. With the Chirashi ($19), the salmon pieces were lean, and there was one of each of octopus and surf clam. There was a fresh piece of lettuce and cucumber slices as well. The rice was nicely marinated and there were tiny fish roe scattered all over. Quite a generous amount compared to most places. I think I would have been happier with the salmon chirashi or maybe some maki instead. Better luck next time!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Actually real Japanese restaurant, superb quality over time (we've been coming since 2006). Construction in the neighbourhood wasn't doing them a favour, but they prevailed, hats off. Really love their personalized service and understated attitude. Expect none of the Albertan obscene portion sizes, it's for your own good. Best and most authentic sushi place in town.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Whatsupb? No wait, that's wrong. Sushi Wasabi is a small but cozy Japanese restaurant located on the south side of town. The restaurant is hidden in a tiny strip mall area (look for the Shell gas station) but is definitely worth checking out. It reminded me of Vancouver as Sushi Wasabi has that cramped, intimate feel to it (to some extent). Does that mean you can skip the trip to Vancouver? Haha, let's not go overboard with those type of expectations youngin'.

We went on a Sunday for dinner and the place was pretty busy. We didn't have to wait (score!) but if you can't grab a seat, there's always the best spot in the house (sushi bar), which was empty when we arrived. Sushi Wasabi had a bunch of interesting daily specials so we decided to try out a few along with ordering a few others off their menu. The waitresses are all very friendly and the chef's are the same, greeting you when you enter and exit.

- Green tea ($3.00 for two) - the tea was hot, delicious and unlimited. My tea drinking goes through the roof when I'm at restaurants, haha.
- Goshumori (5 Item Plate) ($8.00) -an appetizer dish of eggplant saut√©ed with chili miso, takowasa, vinegared lotus root, smoked monkfish liver and vermicelli salad. I enjoyed the eggplant and monkfish liver (very similar texture to a p√¢t√©). The vinegared lotus root looked pretty but didn't have much taste to it. The tako was good but man, why are they so difficult to pick up? Haha. The vermicelli salad tasted like a poor man's coleslaw unfortunately.
- #6 Sushi combination ($22.00) - beautifully plated, you get one piece each of tuna, salmon, shrimp, surf clam, octopus, yellowtail, imitation crab stick, tobiko and masago. Also included is one roll of kappa-maki (cucumber). All the nigiri was good and everything tasted fresh.  The slices were slightly on the smaller side but the quality is there.
- Aburi salmon maki (seared) ($6.95), negitoro ($5.75) and spicy tuna ($5.75) - we tried the aburi salmon, which was one of their daily specials along with two uramaki rolls. The negitoro (tuna and green onions) and spicy tuna were a nice contrast to each other. Each order gets you 6 pieces. Everything was delicious but my fav was the aburi salmon. Searing the salmon gave it a nice charred flavour and the addition of red onions was something completely unexpected.

My first experience at Sushi Wasabi was a great one and I am happy to have found another good sushi spot in town. South side seems to be the spot to go to when you want Asian good eats. Wasabi out.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Maybe the most authentic Japanese experience in Edmonton. The sushi rice is so fresh and packed with flavour.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
I have to be honest that I don't like much Japanese restaurants in Edmonton.  But Wasabi's food is excellent. I was craving their blue fin tuna and their chop chop and it satisfied my craving x10!! Definitely a go-to place!,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in Edmonton.

Pros
Great quality fish
Family run
Lots of free parking
Really  good food for the money

Cons
Open and closed odd hours
You have to rsvp because this place is very small",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Fantastic sushi. I have been to this restaurant DOZENS of times. The sushi is delicious and always fresh. California rolls are enormous and best in the city. Small and family run, if you want to get a table on a Friday or Saturday you better make a reservation! The odd time we have gone during peak hours and waited a long time for food but it happens from time to time. Some waitresses are not overly pleasant, but the food quality makes up for it. Chefs always great you when you come in the door. Will keep returning!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Edmonton. I'm originally from Japan, and I can say with confidence that they serve ""authentic"" Japanese meals you would normally get in Japan. My favorite maki sushi is their special role that comes with crab, grapefruit, avocado etc. - very tasty! I also think their tempura is the best in town - crispy butter. I definitely recommend this place.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Tasty! Fish was fresh, tempura cooked to perfection, beek tataki was very good.  Did take out, so can't speak to the service, but it seemed like it would have been very good.

My only complaint was that it was a little pricey... but I guess we are far enough away from the ocean to justify it for fresh.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"This is a solid  neighborhood establishment serving good quality Japanese food covering all the usual suspects: sushi, tempura, teishoku and the like. 

My family and I have been going to Wasabi for over a decade, from its earlier incarnation as a simple takeout sushi stand in a small shopping centre in Old Strathcona. Over the years, the quality of the food, the generous portions of nigiri and the homely service from the Japanese couple who own the place have not diminished. Deservedly so, this restaurant is consistently busy on Friday and Saturday evenings. 

To be sure, you're not going to get cutting edge fusion Japanese, or haute cuisine from an Iron Chef, but Wasabi is consistent, friendly and has earned my loyalty for years of great sushi and friendly service. In my mind, this makes it stand out from the raft of new Japanese places that have popped up over the past decade in Edmonton. Try the beef tataki too... my favorite item on the menu!

Take out available...",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Ok so by far this is the best Japanese food in the city. Not even close. It all starts with the amazing hot towels that you can clean your hands and face with. We have enjoyed every piece of Sushi we have eaten here. Very fresh and well prepared and your rice or fish are never served cold (big no no) and the wasabi is as fresh and as real as it gets. No coloured horseradish sauce here. It's the real thing. If you go once you'll crave it again and again.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
The best sushi you can get in Edmonton. Pricey but worth it. Very authentic and uses real wasabi (not the powder stuff).,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Fish tastes great and fresh, sushi and rolls well done. Dine in or take out. The restaurant is clean and small, like sushi places all over, they take reservations and have nice pleasant staff. For the best Sushi in Edmonton, go here.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Came here as a tourist because of its excellent reviews. Certainly didn't disappoint and was absolutely amazing. All the food was fresh and high quality. Simply a very very good sushi restaurant. Go ahead and give it a go and you won't be disappointed!,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"We hadn't been here for a few years and though the owners haven't changed, the menu definitely has. They no longer offer yakitori, chicken bits on a stick, as an appetizer. 

One thing that continues to annoy me about this place is the wait persons disregard for our requested appetizers. We specifically asked for three dishes as our appetizers but they showed up at our table willy nilly. We got one person's appetizer, then the sashimi rolls and finally the other two appetizers. I feel this is the servers fault. But it is also management's fault for not training the service staff properly. 

We were not offered hot towels to clean our hands at the beginning of the meal. I don't know if this is due to a change in policy or negligence of the server. 

At any rate, the gyoza got top marks, the octopus balls were okay and a bit of a creepy novelty - see video. The chicken replacement dish was okay, but a bit more meat than I really wanted.  

The big disappointment of the evening were the California rolls. They were bigger than we usually get and had grapefruit pieces in the centre?!! Weird and hard to manage with chopsticks. The smoked salmon and avocado rolls were perfect and the avocado mushroom rolls were good. The green tea is one of my favourites here.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Best place for sushi.  The chop chop cones and the California rolls are amazing!!  One of our go to places for sushi in Edmonton for sure.  Try to make your reservations early.  The restaurant gets full early.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Disappointing service. Lost a customer! I want to give zero stars but the app won't let me. 

staff: friendly greetings at the beginning. Waitress was pleasant when she greeted us.

service: the waitress came and took our drink orders and then our food order. And then she did not come back for a long time. Half hour after our order we commented to each other that usually tempura is out by now. 45 minutes later we waved the waitress down to ask how much longer? She replied ""I will go check"" except she didn't go to the kitchen to check. She went to the computer/till. She came back to ask - sorry which one was your order - after we told her she went back to the computer/till. I went up to her and said - excuse me - are you just putting in the order now? She said oh yes I forgot and will put it in right away. 
I said we have been here over 45 minutes. And you haven't even check in with us. 

They did not apologize and they did not try to offer anything to encourage us to stay. 

We cancelled our order and went to YOKOZUNA instead!

Sadly will not be returning to Wasabi again.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Serves authentic Japanese food - but in small portions and highly over priced.  If this is not an issue then try it. There are other places that serves the same but not as pricey as this one.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Sushi Wasabi is a little gem in a stripmall near Southgate Mall (behind the Petro-Canada). It's quite small and busy all the time - reservations definitely recommended. 

We only sampled sashimi and maki. Their menu is very traditional, which is nice - don't expect any of those weird cream cheese rolls. The rice in the maki is perfect - lovely grains that are not mushy, and stick together nicely. My favourites are the spicy tuna, spicy octopus, tuna with green onion, and unagi. Simple, and showcases the quality of ingredients. Strangely, they don't have any spicy salmon or regular salmon rolls? However they do have salmon sashimi which is just phenomenal - they use high quality fish that is very fresh and actually tastes the way it should (in contrast to some places where the fish looks good but tastes like nothing). You can also order sashimi by the piece - basically anything they offer as nigiri, you can also get as sashimi. The one nigiri I did order was chop chop - I love the scallop - this one had roe mixed into the mayo which was neat. Unfortunately I found that there was too much mayo - too saucy for my liking.

For takeout, you have to order from their little paper menu (see Kris B.'s photos). I didn't compare it to their regular menu but I am pretty sure it is pared down. They have take-out specials that are mostly nigiri/simple maki combos (substitutions accepted for a fee).

It's not cheap, but I'd definitely come back to try some other items like black cod (and eat more sashimi). I would be here all the time if it was closer to me!
Note: don't expect great things for white wine - they only had two options but were out of the better one. Better to stick with beer :)",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"This is the best Japanese restaurant in Edmonton. Though they have a rather limited menu, the quality of their food is amazing. There is a distinct difference for their sashimi/sushi compared to other restaurants (freshness?cut?). Some of the items that are definitely worth getting are: beef tataki, assorted sashimi, chop chop cone, negitoro cone, and their special rolls.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
This restaurant is very cute and cozy. It's located in a strip mall near Southgate and easy to miss. The food is reasonably priced and their salmon sashimi is great - very fresh! Hard to find sashimi in this city that isn't partially frozen...,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Been here a few times but won't go back. Yes, the sushi is good (for Edmonton, which is a sad but necessary qualifier) but the service is so poor. 
 
Yes, its a tiny restaurant, but there's no need to seat you next to the toilets or right next to another table, when the restaurant is empty and you've called ahead for a reservation.

You could try ordering take-out ... but be prepared to be quoted more than an hour for your order to be ready.

As a city, we need to stop accepting poor, pretentious and untimely service!!",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Best sushi in ALBERTA... ya, i said it. Between all the sushi joints in Calgary and Edmonton (not even going to entertain the fact that another small prairie town here is going to have comparable sushi) this has been my favorite. I have been here numerous times and the quality and service never falters. 

First of all, its a small family business. The people making your sushi are actually Japanese,which is always a good first sign. Secondly their menu stays pretty traditional. You will not find rolls doused in spicy mayo/brown rice/other western nonsense. Instead the focus is on the quality of the fish which is highlighted by a smudge of wasabi placed on by the chef and perfectly vinegared rice. Prices are extremely fair for the quality of product they are offering. Lastly, if you want to understand what i'm talking about I think the mackerel and toro salmon are unreal here. 

I will say the other cooked items on the menu are just about average so it might be better to just fill up on the sushi pieces here instead as that would be more than sufficient for a pleasing full meal.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"The food here was not bad - probably better than most of the Japanese restaurants in Edmonton. However, I've never been kicked out of a restaurant. My friend and I came here for lunch recently and after our meal were just talking and catching up when at around 1:30pm were told they are locking the doors and asked us to leave. We weren't there for that long, probably just under an hour.  Ive never been to a restaurant that has kicked me out before and it's not like we were lingerers, we had just paid when the waitress came back and told us to pack up.  Anyways, that just tainted the experience for me and I won't be going back.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
Been going to this place for years. Quality of sushi is always consistent. The best sushi in town! Although sometimes they turn away take out orders cause they are so busy. But I will always continue to go back.,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"We have been their regular customers for years, I would say at least a decade.  We started to go to Wasabi when our children were little.  We did try other japanese restaurants but we always ended going back to Wasabi. Wasabi never fail us. Their foods always the top notch and we never once feel disappointed. Their beef tataki is the BEST. We must have our own plate of beef tataki because we don't want to share...lol.  I personally love their Salmon sashimi. Its always fresh and soft, feel like its melting in your mouth. People here have been saying their price is a bit on the expensive side but you get what you pay for.  This is an authentic Japanese restaurant.  Reservation is recommended.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Absolutely amazing!
I cannot get enough of this place. It has delicious sashimi and everyone is so polite there. Awesome service! Pretty small restaurant so I would book reservations just in case.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
It is the best sushi restaurant in the city and the quality has always been high. I just wish we lived closer to an ocean so the couple who own the restaurant had access to fresher food!,jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"It's a family owned restaurant, the environment is good, food was not served very fast but they definitely taste good. One thing, it is really over priced, extremely pricey.............",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Not impressed. Heard (and read) great things about this place, so decided I had to check it out. The night I went in was a Thursday, but it was completely packed. I guess these other people heard good things too. I had high expectations, but left disappointed. Why? Prices are on the high side and the food is bland and minimal. For the cost you'd expect either lots of food or high quality, and we got neither. Tiny portions and very average Japanese food. And service on this day was quite slow. Maybe I'll have to try again to give it another shot, but on this day, the food and the whole experience left much to be desired. I  actually seriously prefer Banzai.",jZoeTGRfhG9n_Jo6VMqwxw
"Only good vibes for this place! Its nestled near the Millcreek ravine so it's close to a lot of trails; it'd be a good place to get a coffee then go for a nice walk. Once you walk in, you're greeted by friendly faces. There's Transcend Coffee on the right, a little meat market at the far center and Biera (brewery/bar/lounge) on the left. Cute wooden tables and bar like seating scattered throughout the middle.

I got the London Fog milkshake which was so delectable especially if you're a fan of London Fog tea. It wasn't too rich and they use Pinocchio ice cream which was a nice local touch. My friend highly recommends the coffee milkshake, best she's ever had and it comes with two espresso shots! 

I'll definitely be trying the brewery and meat market when I'm in the neighbourhood again! Also would be a fun day date on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Love this space as it has it all! Great place to stop by after a run and treat ourselves to their amazing chocolate milkshakes, to meet up with friends or to work for an hour. I also love that my butcher ACME is also in the same space so it makes it easy to do some simple one stop shopping. Overall, great location. Also for those of you that have dogs there is outdoor seating and water always available for the dogs.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"I've had over-priced coffee here several times.  While the place has a cool vibe and is very popular with people in the neighborhood, it charges too much money for decent - not great coffee. When you make Starbucks look reasonably priced, you are too pricey.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Yes, we all love the new Transcend location.  It's new, it shares space with Acme Meats and Creekside Bikes and it has awesome tilework in the bathrooms. But I want to tell you about the beverage I had from Transcend's summer menu...Espresso and Tonic!  Given my newfound love of gin and tonics, I had to try the daytime version.  The combination caught me off guard, and I wasn't sure what to expect.  My first sip was a little tentative, but once I got into it, I really enjoyed the combination of flavours (a little too sweet for my liking, but I don't think they add sugar aside from the Canada Dry tonic water).  It was reminiscent of a sparkling lemonade and it made a really good patio drink.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"This morning I wanted to work somewhere that I wouldn't be bothered, but I needed wifi and caffeine. I love the other transcend locations so decided to give Rickie Market a try. This area is super cute. All the businesses connected to this building are so cool and promote local which I love. I also love wifi without a password and a damn fine cup of coffee.

This place roasts their own coffee and the staff happily tell you all about it! I was served by a lovely man who also told me they make their own syrups for coffee, so no chance of a low sugar vanilla latte, ok!

There is street parking out front and a few spots in the alley. They have a few outdoor seats and loads of seating indoors, including a laptop bar with ample power supply! The bar next door is separated by a glass wall so you can see right in and the ACME meat market is right there. Everything is very open, spacious and gives off a chic market vibe. It's kinda cool that the butchers is in the same room. I know that's not for everyone but I found it fascinating.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"This coffee shop is located by a brewery and while there is only a small area for tables, it still seems to accommodate quite a few.  The menu was limited but the service was great.  Why I did not provide 5 stars is more about the crowd and vibe.  It was not great.  It is hard to define what it is lacking...  it does not serve as a study/work cafe or draws for artistic reasons or otherwise .  It is a place that has been designed nicely but lacks a community feel.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"I have been going to transcend for about ten years. It's the best coffee in the city. Staff are nice and helpful when you have coffee questions. I can't express how good their coffee is, you just need to try it! They also offer fun coffee classes that are informative and fun (before Covid).",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
Always a fav for lattes. Love this location in the Richie market. Lots of seating and nice vibe!,l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Transcend is truly the leader of the Edmonton coffee scene. They've perfected the art of roasting beans, and the beans are direct-trade, ethically sourced. While I appreciate different flavours of roasts, Transcend is definitely my favorite, and I love that the beans are locally roasted.

If you think about it, over the past 10 years, we have all watched Transcend actually transcend the YEG coffee scene. And seeing this new Ritchie location is the equivalent of watching a kid grow up, find their way, and eventually become an adult with their own beautiful life. The beauty of it, the immensity of it, the success. All the struggles that lead to this moment, to this amazing location. It is truly worth checking out just out of pure respect for what Transcend has accomplished.

You'll find all your standard espresso based drinks here with options of soy and almond milk, a variety of coffee roasts to choose from, delicious baked treats, and surprisingly... MILKSHAKES! Made with Pinocchio gelato (locally made in Edmonton for about 30 years I think). I'll be back for a milkshake for sure. They also sell their beans, and an array of high end equipment for home brewers. 

Parking was no problem, and there was plenty of seating available inside, and a couple outdoor tables (hopefully more will be added).

So go check out the best coffee roaster in Edmonton, in the beautiful Ritchie Market complex.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"As soon as you walk in the amazing smell hits you. It's a coffee cafe and roastery. 
Transcend is a quick walk through the ravine from my house. 
It's in the beautiful new Ritchie Market beside the beautiful 'Blind enthusiasm Brewery' 
You can sit outside at the tables with your dog or stay inside, the atmosphere is very charming, you just feel happy when you walk in. 
They offer classes, such as 'coffee tasting and appreciation course' if you want to be an aficionado or 'pour over brewing workshop'. 
These courses are ~ $30-$40. 
This is no Starbucks, this is java culture!! 
Maybe I'll see you there.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"I think I might become a regular! Great location in the Ritchie neighbourhood. Transcend is attached to Blin Brewery, ACME meat market and a bicycle shop. It is super spacious with a nice open concept. 

I had a latte and chocolate croissant. They have a few pastry options which is always needed with a coffee! Coffee wise, you cannot go wrong.

There are also patio spots outside and bicycle racks around the corner. The neighbourhood is definitely becoming hipper all the time!",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
Poul and his team do a great job. Even though they have expanded to more locations the quality has remained hi.,l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"This place is in that new building right above Millcreek Ravine, a big walk through the ravine, up a hill and I'm at the best coffee house in Edmonton! Check it out! Great atmosphere.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"A nice little coffee shop in the Ritchie neighbourhood. Their iced coffee tastes like watery assholes, but I think that's a personal thing. It just wasn't the creamy concoction I was expecting. The cappuccinos, however, are amazing, and the service was friendly and informative.

The only thing this location needs is a comfy couch or two, but I get the aesthetic.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"The Ritchie area is the perfect quaint area. Transcend has such a great atmosphere and excellently brewed beverages. My friend and I came on a cold winter day so I walked in expecting to order a hot drink to warm me up. However, the second I saw they had a chai latte milkshake, it was GAME OVER. I got a cold beverage on a cold day and I was NOT disappointed. It was creamy and delicious and was so happy with my decision. There is ample space for seating and a good amount of natural light through the windows. I would definitely recommend coming here for the environment. Truly in love! :)",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Transcend has by far the best lattes in town! I normally go to this location, cause it's also close to a set of stairs I run on. It's a perfect go to if I wanna get a work out in, then stop in to get some work done. They have lots of plug ins and it's also attached to Bierra, if you're looking to transition from coffee to beer!

I've been on the hunt all throughout the city trying different lattes. And, Transcend wins by a landslide. It doesn't even matter which location you go to, the Ritchie Market or the Garneau location. That's what's so incredible about it. It doesn't matter who makes my lattes, it tastes the same each time. Consistence is key! They don't ever make their lattes too hot. It's perfect temperature so you can drink straight away. I always get it with almond milk, and it'd literally heaven when I take my first sip. 
I can even get it to go, or to stay, again, it's always consistently great.

I don't get pastries here too much. It would be wonderful if they started getting scones in. But, they have more croissants and muffins. I like their spinach and feta, or the chocolate croissant. However, they don't warm up the pastry at all. So, that's the only down side if you're looking to eat something warm. I'm giving it 5 stars solely on the lattes I've tried and just the overall ambiance of this cafe.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"The latte and London fog were great, but the atmosphere is lacking something here. 
We bought two different kinds of beans that they roasted on site. They both make a weak cup of coffee, unfortunately.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"I cannot speak highly enough about this place and their amazing coffee. Every single one of the staff are refreshingly friendly and extremely well trained. The coffee is so consistently good and fresh no matter what you buy or who makes it for you, and the atmosphere is comfortable and esthetically pleasing. I love it here and am a customer for life!",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"This is a coffee house that just happens to be right across the office where I work. It is a very convenient place for me during downtime or when my hunger pains are at an all-time high. Located in Richie Market Place, where there is also an amazing meat market-(Acme Meats not making a pun!), this is a offbeat unpretentious place that is welcoming. The service is prompt, friendly and coffee seems to be commendable based on conversations with peers and colleagues. Admittedly, I was not there for a coffee but rather to have something to sustain me till the afternoon. Although they didn't have a vast selection of food, I selected some baked goods of a cinnamon bun and a croissant. To my amazement, both tasted like they were freshly baked this morning and was soft, buttery, flaky and went down wonderfully. I was completely satisfied and guilty for making such short work of these delectable items in world record time. Next time I go there, I will take more time and soak up the ambiance with one of their coffees.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"We started our day @ Transcend before a planned afternoon of shopping & lunch on Whyte Ave in Edmonton. 

The coffee & cookies were the best I've had recently. Transcend is Situated in the heart of a sweet little market  known as 'RITCHIE MARKET'.

I had heard about this gem, today was my first visit ! I picked something up from ACME, and appreciated the super cool, passionate barista that assisted us. He made the 20minute drive for coffee worth the wait. Ok the coffee vibes and funky market are the real reason to go, but EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE HELPS, and this dude was awesome!  


Transcend is a great destination spot. GO!",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"We were down the street and decided to stop in to buy some fresh beans for home - and we're so glad we did. The building itself is a beautiful space and seeing the roaster right in the building made us feel like our beans were extra fresh. Grabbed a couple of bags that were roasted the day before according to the date and will definitely be back. It's definitely a different feel from the Transcend next to the Garneau, but it's a nice space. Our go-to for fresh beans for sure.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Amazing coffee and great bicycle parking are some of the reasons Transcend in Richie Market is my favorite weekend morning coffee stop. If you take a slight detour from the nearby Mill Creek Ravine paths, or you happen to be in the area and value top notch coffee, you can come in and enjoy drip coffee, cold brew, espresso beverages, lattes and great teas. And there are businesses sharing the space that you can also visit like Biera.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"What a wonderful new addition to the Ritchie neighbourhood! The building is sleek and modern, with quite a few other shops sharing the space. There's a few tables outside for patio action and little puppy hooks to tie your doggo's leash to while you get your coffee!

Transcend coffee is, as always, awesome. Very flavourful! There aren't many food options here though, so if you're looking for some bites, you'll probably want to head elsewhere.

On this particular trip, I decided to try out their non-coffee beverages and was a little disappointed. I got the iced london fog, which was okay but not great. It was on the bitter side and still had tea grounds in it. My partner got the chocolate milkshake (which I hear is made with gelato!) and taste-wise, it was yuummmy! It was a little runny though, maybe because of the gelato? I prefer a thicker milkshake myself.

In any case, it's a great little cafe and I'm excited to come back when all the other stores are open and explore.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
Transcend is a great coffee house in Edmonton. I believe the Ritchie community is growing and I can't wait to see what it turns into. Great service! but not the best cell service.,l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
Came here today for the first time and ordered an iced mocha which cost me $6.50!! I'm all for supporting local businesses but that's an insane amount for a drink that was mostly milk with the tiniest shot of espresso and chocolate added. I'll stick to Starbucks!,l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"We have been buying our coffee beans since before Transcend opened this location in Ritchie Market.  Now, with this location, we not only purchase beans, but also coffee as they are so much closer to where we live.  The staff a friendly, the waits are never too long for drinks, and the coffee is excellent.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Transcend is my favorite coffee shop in the city!  I used to enjoy their old location, but the Ritchie Market makes this so much more of an experience.  The feel is great, lots of things going on around you but the open concept takes care of that.  You can concentrate on what you have to or easily have a conversation over a coffee.  Great place!",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"The way the handle the whole covid situation is decent. I have been there 3 times and I have to say it isn't my cup of coffee, personally i find it a little too citrusy? I may have had a different bag of a different bean. To be fair. I love the vibe and the look of the place the staff are always very polite and it does take a little more time for the coffee to come but when it does it is it's own specific taste. I would definitely recommend to take a stroll down the river valley and have a cup. Support Local!!!",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"I had wanted to try this place for awhile and finally did... I got the maple flavoured flat white and my partner got a matcha latte. The drinks were good, I liked the consistency of the foam with the pours. The packaging very thought out. The only downfall was the price, I found it overpriced. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Wonderful to see another location of one of my favourite coffee shops in Edmonton. This location in the new Ritchie Market has lots of seating, plug-ins for computers and other devices, and is very spacious. You'll find the same great drink selection as the Garneau location. Drinks are pricey but very rich and fresh. The aroma of delicious coffee hits you as soon as you walk through the doors. If you're in Ritchie, this is a great place to hang out and work or have a meeting.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Hmm. Very interesting. Definitely not my favourite transcend because of the super weird layout and location, but i enjoyed my visit all the same. 

They're located inside a building in Ritchie that shares its space with a butcher/meat shop, bike gear store, and soon to be restaurant. They have a fair amount of seating, mostly high tables, and the place is always packed with members of the community. Mostly people on bike rides or walks with their families enjoying a nice sunny day. Can't blame them, transcend is a nice place to come and chill out. 

Drinks were great and pastries were good, on that front it's a typical transcend. The staff weren't overly friendly (the staff at the 109 location are way friendlier) but were pretty quick and my drink tasted great. The place was pretty clean even though it was super packed which was nice! 

The only thing I just can't get over is them sharing their space with the meat shop. The last thing I want to be looking at when enjoying a cup of coffee is dead animal flesh (sorry!). On the walk to the bathroom you can see them chopping up everything and it just makes me very uncomfortable. My friend who is a vegetarian was also quite uncomfortable coming here- it just seemed weird and out of place. 

Anywho, cute location in an up and coming community. And it's only a few blocks away from my place! I still prefer other locations but I might come here more often to check things out.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"I think it's the best coffee in Edmonton, but you pay for it too. Over 6 beans for a medium latte. I would go there all the time if the price were lower, but now and then I treat myself. They never seem to be empty, so their prices must be ballanced correctly with demand.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"As someone who purchases their own beans and grinds them at home, Transcend is always my top choice. They always have a great selection of fresh blends and the staff is very knowledgeable about the products they carry.",l8uzbLGk9CLjElcWGyBZ0Q
"Went with a large party of 20. Cold food in absolutely no particular order. Received the bread last? Who does this? Sat at 8 pm, first side dish cane out at 930. My husband ordered the burger with fries, fries came 30 minutes after the burger?!This restaurant can't get it together.
Service was amazing. That's why I gave it a one star.
Ordered the bone marrow, one side had a small amount, enough to spread on two tiny crostini's.
The other half was empty!
Boo. Thumbs down.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Love this place food is Devine, Jacob is always our server and is absolutely fantastic.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"We had dinner here about 4 nights ago, with some friends. It occupies the space where Rick's Grill used to be. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. For a restaurant that prides itself on serving Wagyu beef, it was a disappointment. 

I ordered the Brant Lake Wagyu ribeye. I ordered it medium rare, and it is served with creamed spinach and mushrooms. All the food was cold, not even warm. The steak was somewhere between blue and rare. You received a tablespoon of the creamed spinach and 3 or 4 small mushrooms. If you don't order any side dishes, you will definitely be leaving hungry. My wife had the tandoori chicken with a side of the cheesey corn, which was a better choice. 

The service was good, although the person who seated us was asked some questions about the menu, which he couldn't answer, nor did he make any effort to inquire about.  For a restaurant that can charge $160 for a steak, it needs to up its game a long way.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"DOSC: Drunken Ox, Sober Cat. 

Drunken Ox, Sober Cat are the two themes for the entire restaurant. Drunken Ox for the bar and lounge side. Sober Cat for the relaxed, coffee shop side. For this particular visit, I sat in the Drunken Ox bar side in a big booth by the kitchen. If you like small sharing plates and meat, then this is the spot for you. I don't usually eat meat, but when in Alberta... can't say no to that 'Berta beef. 

I was with a group of 3 and we ordered and shared the following dishes:
+ Sweetbreads (kind of reminded me of popcorn chicken. One of my faves!)
+ Bone marrow (I did not eat the bone marrow, but my fellow diners really seemed to enjoy it)
+ Tenderloin carpaccio (Comes w/ bread, olives, and a spread - think charcuterie board compliments)
+ Gnocchi (That butternut cream.... *drool* - Tied with the sweetbreads for being my fave)
+ Mushroom (I don't usually like mushrooms... but I liked these mushrooms!)
+ Brussel Sprouts (There's something about ordering brussel sprouts in a restaurant. It ALWAYS tastes better than what I make at home.)
+ Beets (Another favourite, just a little behind the sweetbreads and gnocchi)

Everything was delicious. All the dishes were beautifully plated and the flavours left my tastebuds wanting more. Portions were a bit small for what we were paying, but when you come here you're paying for the quality and the ambiance. 

To drink, I got a lavender oat milk latte, and it was one of the tastiest lattes I've ever had. I did not partake in any cocktail drinking this time around, unfortunately, but if I'm back in Edmonton, I'd come here again to try some of their creative drinks.

If you're looking for delicious food and cocktails, head to DOSC. Guaranteed you'll leave in a food-and-cocktail-induced coma.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Wheew........what a great place for drinks.

And the steaks are something else!!!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"This place just opened and I just moved in nearby, what a perfect combo! The entrance is easy to overlook, for all its on the corner of 104 St and 102 Ave in the heart of downtown. But inside is bright and airy and surprisingly spacious. Small tables by the windows have a great view of 104 St for people watching, and the interior has larger tables for bigger groups, plus lots of space at the bar too. 

I stopped by for late brunch on Sunday around 2:30pm and found their brunch menu is surprisingly reasonably priced, considering the downtown location and trendy looks of the place. The Rose & Leaf cocktail was tasty and refreshing and not too sweet; the tostada was a little odd (avocado, poached egg, and crispy Brussels sprouts on a large tortilla chip with sauces) so I ordered it just to try something different. I think it would be better on toasted sourdough to be honest, but it was very tasty nonetheless. 

Only down side and the reason this is 4 stars not 5 was the service was a little slow; ordering was fine, but although after I finished my brunch and drink I was considering a second drink or a pastry/dessert, Sean did not return to check on me for soooo long that by the time he finally came back I just asked for the bill. Still, I expect I'll be back, interested to try some of their other brunch dishes and to check out their dinner menu also.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"A friend and I went for dinner prior to a recording session at my studio, which is down the block on 104 st. We have eaten in most of the restaurants on the block, but there are always new places turning up.
When I first moved to this street 21 years ago, 104st was a wasteland of surface parking lots and just 1 restaurant.
It was also where you came to buy crack, but I digress...
In those 2 decades I have watched 104 st turn into the most vibrant street in Edmonton, and the dining choices have increased exponentially.

We walked north down the street trying to figure where we would dine, and when we saw DOSC (Drunken Ox, Sober Cat) we realised neither of us had been there under this incarnation.
We had visited Rick's Grill more than once, and were expecting something similar.
We were mistaken.
DOSC is a beautifully appointed space, anchored by 2 large service islands, the first serving coffee (Sober Cat) and the second a well set up cocktail bar. (Drunken Ox)
The lovely young lady who greeted us at the door seated us quickly and efficiently, and we had not been in our places more than a few seconds when our server showed up with menus.

We were expecting burgers and such, but we found ourselves in a high end steak house. Ironically, neither of us actually wanted steak.
Fortunately the ""non-steak"" choices are excellent and having ordered ourselves local microbrew beverages, I ordered Braised Duck Breast served with Root Vegetables and my associate the Pan Seared Sea Bass, on a bed of Navy Beans.

It is important to note, that the dinner menu here is short, and it is pricey. Mine was one of the least expensive entrees on the menu, at $34.00, the fish, about the same.
The steaks look really good, but are also top end.

Our dishes arrived, and we tucked in.
My Duck Breast was two decent pieces of duck, with 3 Grilled Roots Vegetables. I want to say Parsnips, or a Specialty Carrot (I did not take notes, and cannot find the menu we got online.) along with several chunks of potato.
The Duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, as were the potatoes. The mystery tubers were unique and visually pleasing, but the taste did little for me. They had an almost chemical aftertaste to my palate.

My Buddy's Sea Bass was perfectly cooked, but the big winner was the Navy Bean roulade it was served on. It was the most sumptuously delicious part of the meal.

The food at DOSC is superb and the skill of the cooks beyond reproach. The service is also top notch, and I would say DOSC has the highest ratio of servers to customers I have seen in this town, all professional and courteous. The restaurant itself is beautiful and well laid out, and the washrooms are clean enough you could eat in them. (Don't...)

I would like to try out their Cafe section for breakfast or lunch, sometime. The prices seem more reasonable, and the food choices more up my alley.
I would even return for dinner, if only to load the table with amazing sounding appetizers.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I've been for lunch and dinner recently. The menu is currently the same for both, but I believe they are working on a lunch menu. Here's my take on what I've tried:

Butternut Gnocchi: 4/5. Great flavours, but the portion is small. Questionable if it is quite enough for sharing.

Risotto: 5/5. Cooked perfectly. 

Brussel sprouts: 3.5/5. They were charred on the outside and not quite cooked enough on the inside.

Brisket: 4/5. It's a tasty dish, but I wasn't blown away.

Short rib: 2.5/5. I've heard so many great things about the short rib. The only flavour was the spicy Korean bbq sauce on the outside. The meat itself did not have much for flavour. It was tender, but I think it may have tasted a bit off TBH. I would say the portion size of this dish is shareable, dependant on how much of the ribs is fat. 

Honey cake: 5/5. I had it twice. So good.

The service has always been exceptional. If you're considering coming here, I say go for it. You probably won't be disappointed. Now that I've been here a couple times, I have no hankering to go back any time soon. But I don't regret trying it.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"DOSC seems to be a hit and miss from all the reviews. I had it for breakfast and dinner. For breakfast I ordered the breakfast sandwich and it was good! I really like it. However it was a bit small. I enjoyed the breakfast so I thought ill try dinner. We ordered the brussel sprout, oxtail poutine, steak, and katsu burger. Brussel sprout was good, but after 3 it started to taste bland and burnt. Oxtail poutine was not bad but the fries was a bit too busy... it could have been better. Katsu burger was delish and very filling, I would order this again. The steak was COLD .... Our friends also ordered it and it was also COLD! why?? the steak was very tender but the cold really killed it... For a 'steak' place serving COLD steak ... Really?! I hope they improve on the steak part ASAP!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"The four of us chose DOSC for a girls night out and it did not disappoint! We shared beef carpaccio, brussel sprouts, and croquettes for appys then each ordered a steak - mine was a 6 oz tenderloin and it was medium rare. The steaks were all cooked perfectly. And we had the mac n' cheese, mash, and mushroom risotto for sides. There was not a single dish that we didn't like. It was a lot of food and we were all extremely full. And yet, we still wanted dessert. I got the coconut bar with a peppermint fog from the cafe. I took half the coconut bar home due to being too full and had it with my next morning's coffee. One more note, the bartenders are extremely talented and you can do ""dealer's choice"" cocktail where you tell them which liquor you want and what flavour you're looking for and they will craft something for you. I asked for vodka, citrusy but not too sweet and they made something with triple sec and lemon zest that was delicious and refreshing. Can't wait to go back!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Went to dosc for brunch and the food was great! It's a beautiful restaurant and the service was amazing. Our server Jacob was the best, super nice and charismatic and made our experience so much better, will definitely come back!!!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Decided to try out DOSC with two other couples. Really enjoyed ourselves - the steak was excellent, the beef tongue was my highlight and cocktails hit the spot. The only downside was how small some of the sides are. Three carrots and a couple spoonfuls of mashed potatoes with marrow, for example. Will definitely return.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
It was a really good experience. Love the menu. Food was delicious and I left without feeling bloated !! One place to improve is the coffee drinks. They were just ok.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I was pretty impressed with this place!
At first I thought it was kind of strange that the steaks don't come with sides but it makes it all the more customizable and less wasteful!

The food here is great, I got the regular rib eye and my friends got the wagyu rib eye

Very well presented and the food was delicious

The servers here are also very friendly and attentive from what I've seen!

This is a great place to go for a date night or dinner with friends if you are okay with share plates!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Good steak!  We ordered a plethora of dishes from DOSC and everything was delicious!  A little bit on the pricier side so would recommend to go with about 4 people so everyone can share a bit of everything. 

Overall I had a pretty good experience here and would recommend for anyone who is visiting Edmonton",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Drunk Ox Sober Cat... I've driven by here a couple times and the name intrigued me. I came for dinner and it was easy to make reservations with opentable as well as make changes to the date... I was aiming for a non-event night as parking can be outrageous in the area if there was a concert or hockey game happening at Roger's Place. I even got a confirmation call in the daytime of my reservation including a verification inquiry on potential food allergies which is pretty thoughtful. 
I've been at this location when it was formerly a burger joint and although the bones of the interior is the same, they have revamped the space into an inviting, contemporary and industrial atmosphere. The caf√© bakery area is quite distinct from the lounging and dining area which makes it easy to suit a number of patrons. I have to give a shout out to the washrooms here...they have a Japanese style toilet (if you know what that's about) and the counters have basic toiletries & essentials to use; like you were at someone's home! 
It wasn't busy on a weekday and service was constant & attentive and friendly without being rushed. I have to say the main attraction of the night was the menu. Food comes out quickly and it's absolutely scrumptious from start to finish. It's the kind of food that haunts you until your return visit. We had the beef marrow appetizer, oxtail poutine, wagyu katsu burger, beef brisket. It was so.much.food. They do pack leftovers though which is great. I'm a little sorry that I didn't try the wagyu steaks because that seemed to be a star feature of this place, but it's also a reason to come back. I'm now also enticed by the daytime menu & cafe section of this place and I'm glad a place like this has graced Edmonton with its presence!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"This place was absolutely delicious!!! There was 4 of us and we all ordered different things. All of us had a great meal. The flavors were amazing. They brought us the steaks ordered before they were cooked and gave us a little overview of the marbling and where they came from etc. The atmosphere was very casual but the flavors were high end for sure. The appetizer we had was the oxtail poutine it was the best! We had salmon, ribeyes and a sirloin. Sides were Brussels sprouts and mushrooms. All of it was great!!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I visited on their first official soft opening day for some breakfast. What I loved about the menu is that each dish is about $6-$7 (some less), so you get to order several dishes if you'd like. I myself went with the vanilla porridge and the 3 egg scrambled casserole. Both were really good, and I was asked if I wanted to add sausage or bacon as a side to the eggs. This isn't indicated on the menu.

It is so very clear that a lot of love was put into every detail, from the welcoming & stylish decor to the tasty food. It's no surprise that everything tasted great. 

I have yet to make it in for dinner, but I do recommend checking it out in the morning for some good coffee and tasty bites.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
First off the restaurant has a cool vibe and nice layout. The chairs they have in their reservation area for larger groups are horrible. So uncomfortable. The service was decent. They forgot a couple drinks and dinner took almost an hour and half to come out. They showed us the cuts of meat raw that we ordered which I thought was cool but unnecessary. Now for the quality. The meat wasn't up to the price tag. The ribeye was fatty and barely any meat for 20 some dollars. The sides were good and expensive. Overall I was disappointed with this restaurant which I was looking forward to going and trying.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"One of my favourite spots right now! 
The cafe during the day is quiet and super trendy. 
Coffee is fantastic and so are the snacks!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Amazing hot spot we were all super impressed with. A fantastic date night, superb drinks, divine food, great vibe. We first tried this place out during a Yelp event and what impressed us most was how organized they were for the event, if they can be organized so well for a special event I couldn't help but be drawn back to see the space and experience it on a date night. At the event we had a sample of their Brussel sprouts and I was pleased to see them on their regular menu and ordered up two plates! That sweet white sauce, tastes like donair sauce, paired with the crispy honey brussel sprouts is an addictive combination! We also ordered to. Butterfly Pea flower br√ªl√©e and the presentation blew us away!! I love that it was all edible, including the flowers, but the taste was equally heavenly! Definitely would recommend this dessert any day. 
Cocktail Drinks were all well done and had great flavour, the gin sour was also a delight. And we love craft beer, especially local, so seeing a local brewery on tap was an automatic choice for my hubby. 
It's hard to want to go somewhere else on a future date night when this place hit the top of the charts for us so well. Loved that we could see into the kitchen; that always speaks volumes when you can see right into the heart of a restaurant, the bathrooms were so clean, the private party room looked like a great room with casks for decor. I would be intrigued to try some of the steak as this place is listed as a steakhouse. Next date night for sure!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Little bit pricier, only came here for drinks. 

Very cool interior style, half is a cafe and the other half is a bar. Enjoyable atmosphere.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I hate to give a down the middle review but that's how I felt after leaving. My service was poor. After being seated I waited 20 minutes before stopping someone to ask if I had a server. Someone finally took my order and brought me a lukewarm hot chocolate a few minutes later. My food came in a reasonable amount of time but the portion seemed small. Nobody ever came back to my table to check on me or fill my empty water glass. After I was done eating the gnocchi (which I enjoyed) it took a while for someone to bring my check. What sounds like a horrible experience was rectified a bit with a free hot chocolate, free cookie (which seemed spicy), and genuinely nice people.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"The best part about this place is the service. In particular, Celine is awesome.

The second best thing is the bartenders. True mixologists for lack of a better term. I was thoroughly impressed by them.

The third best thing is the women's washroom has awesome amenities like feminine hygiene products. Very progressive!

Otherwise I king of went back and forth between a 3 and a 4. It's more of a 3.5.

Menu is uninteresting. I read some stuff about how they were attempting to be more vegetarian friendly? I remember avoiding before because the menu wasn't my style. Then I heard through the grapevine that they had changed a few things? Maybe I heard wrong. Idk, I wouldn't recommend this place to vegetarian/vegan friends. For them I would say avoid. You can order the brussel sprouts without pancetta, that's about it. Not sure why it is being purported as friendly to vegetarians? It isn't, and that is OK! 

Fish Tacos were decent! Kale salad was OK, but very light on the dressing and some of the kale looked a bit off. 

Ambiance is meh. It's nice but didn't really have a ""wow"" factor for me. The crowd wasn't really my style either. I can see myself having fun here back when I was 21, maybe not at near 30. We didn't stay too long. 

While I appreciate the good things, it's not really me. I may come back but it's not a place I would wait in line for or fight tooth and nail to get into.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
Beautifully delicious food. We sat in the Sober Cat by the window (excellent lighting) and had an array of breakfast foods to share. Reasonably priced and such a warm experience!,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I've now been to DOSC three times this week, that's not including the VIP night. The concept is SO unique. I love stopping by for a cup of local light roaat rogue wave coffee on the way to work, unfortantly I have to wait longer for a pour over because their don't have it on drip. 

I had dinner their last night, I can say without a doubt that's one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. I had the striploin, not an expensive cut of meat, but it sure tasted like it! The marrow mash is to die for. 

My only suggestions would be to add the notes to those yellow cards of encouragement like you did on the VIP night. I was dissapointed to see they didn't continue this. And get some vanilla syrup for the cafe, people love flavoured lattes, you'll make a ton off of the additional cost to charge people for a vanilla late (coming from a former barista).",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I completely adore the vibe and interior of DOSC. 

Walking up the stairs and turning in, you're welcomed into the split space of cafe and dining. The light airy side of the cafe, molded from the exposed brick wall down to the velvet upholstered lounge chairs transitions amazingly to the dining sace. The dining area has more of a masculine feel, with dark leather couches playing with bold colored feature walls. The wooden beams with the additional eclectic brass piping features along the ceiling and the bar...Each detail comes together into  mismatched perfection, resulting in such a cool space. 

With my schedule playing i've only had time to make it down for their brunch. Basically got a chance to try everything- giving you guys a pretty good idea on what my take is on this space brunch wise. 

Now, service every single time i've been has been amazing. The servers are always so personable and friendly. They know their menu and aren't scared of  recommendations, which I'm super appreciative especially when trying new eateries. 

Food summary- As much as I love their space and detail to design. I really was expecting more from their dishes. With more misses than hits, presentation being the biggest aspect lacking for me. If not the the aesthetics and the vibe I dont think the I would have been back as much as I have been. 


Carbonated Fruit Cake - ($5) - The weirdest yet most impressive dish if id have to choose, the after taste is straight sizzly carbonation, baked into the pineapple sponge.Taste was okay, wouldn't order again though.

Millet Porridge with Mango Fresh Berries - ($6) - A play at oatmeal with some added fruits to make it boujee. This was surprisingly filling and made me feel super healthy ordering. - But honestly having oatmeal and rolled oats at home.. could you really justify spending 6 dollars on it? Eh. 

Buttermilk Stack Pancakes - ($7) -  The coconut cream is the biggest part of why I loved this dish so much I'd order this again for sure.

Prime Rib Hash - ($14) - The first dish I tried, and the best so far out of all my visits was this dish alone.The meat was super tender and the paired brandy brown sauce, YES. Scoop up a little bit of that mash and you've got yourself a perfect bite. 

Crispy Pulled Chicken - ($13) - So deceiving; I read crispy and automatically was drooling for something satisfying like fried chicken but what was brought out was something close to resembling bird food with a side of extra dry strings of chicken. Nothing else to say but, pass. 

Steak and Eggs - ($15) -  probably my second favorite dish out of the brunch items I've tried. They know how to cook their steaks -lemme give them props to that. Portion was surprisingly big as well. 

Country Sausage - ($3) - 2 Choices and we opted for the chicken cranberry sage combo, taste was unique and yummy. Came with 2 small pieces of sausage. 


DOSC also ended up being our NYE2019 place of choice and I got some cocktails to try.  The French 1914($13) and the Ryes and Shine ($13) -I'm a pretty big cocktail fanatic, especially when they look pretty and these...looked pretty. Taste was waaaaaaaaay too strong. Didn't end up finishing mine and ended up just getting chardonnay after. Food was just like brunch visits. With only one dish standing out and presentation lacking as a whole. 

Hopefully things improve as they keep updating their menu. Will still give them another shot because I'm absolutely smitten with the aesthetics.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"DOSC is probably one of my favorite restaurants this summer. They have a good ambiance and scenery of downtown Edmonton. I was bit taken aback when I learned that it was a cafe-slash-steakhouse I thought it was gonna be loud but it wasn't like other restaurants. Their customer service was really good too. Our server let us know beforehand that they serve tapas style of food from their dinner menu and suggested to try at least 4 dishes from the menu which we did and it did not disappointed us. We ordered the striploin steak and rib-eye steak cause I heard a lot of buzz about it and it was delicious, it was seasoned well and it melts into your mouth. We even ordered the arugula, bone marrow mash and the barley fried rice. I totally recommend the bone marrow mash, it's not alot but you can definitely taste the flavour of the bone marrow. The only downside is we wanted to try their desserts but we didn't get alot of options because they ran out of them and only left us with few desserts to try. Overall, it was a good experience their steaks were really good and it was definitely worth the price. I totally recommend it & would totally comeback for it. I just can't wait to have their full steakhouse menu the next time that i would go.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"The best restaurant in Edmonton. Great ambience, excellent service and delicious food. Highly recommend the steak, brussel sprouts and cabbage salad. They also have a great cafe with good snacks and great coffee.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Everything about DOSC is great. From the time we walked in to the time we left it was great. We were greeted when we got in, the decor was nice, service was excellent with our water glasses always full, and every single dish of food we had was top knotch. We had the skirt steak which was cooked perfectly, my brother had the wagyu Katsu burger which he enjoyed, and we all shared the salted potatoes, gnocchi, and sweet bread which was all excellent with amazing flavours. We finished with the honey cake which was also perfect. Thanks so much for the great dining experience DOSC. Keep it up!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
I haven't gotten my food yet but I had to write about the service. When I came in it was a bit confusing because I wanted to sit on the window side but order food. The hostess told me that I could do that but would need to order from the barista. That's fine. I needed help ordering beer so a server (Sara) was sent over to help me with the selection. Sara was amazing. She was eager to accommodate and was quick to tell me she would bring me samples of the entire menu. She is super friendly but not too much. Perfect service. I find so often these days I feel like I'm bothering the servers (?). Sara was a pleasant surprise. Food review to come.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"What a neat place! DOSC is an odd name that stands for Drunken Ox Sober Cat. It's a coffee shop during the day and a hip reso at night. There's a cool ""meat window"" where you can look at all of the cuts on offer. The decor is great too and you'll have to pardon me for mentioning it but they have the fanciest toilets in YEG! In the ladies room anyway. It was a major discussion point at our table and I can't recall that ever happening before. We had a big group and there didn't seem to be a lot of service on that night. Our server was nice, but the service was a little slow. There is a good variety on the drink menus as well. The dessert menu was ok, featuring cheesecake in a jar. 

This isn't a budget friendly place either so come prepared! The cuts of meat are delicious and high-quality but don't come as a meal, you have to order the sides.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Dope bartenders and cocktails, theyre never a dull moment. The baristas are also so nice and make good conversation every time i come in to grab a coffee. The food is good but a little pricey. You gotta try the tongue its my fave dish!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Wow wow wow! 
So we tried this place on the 1st day of its soft opening for brunch. It was our first date and the food was just alright. But we live not far from here and in the 2+ years DOSC has grown on us. The cocktails are fantastic, we had celebrated our 2 years and enjoyed the most fantastic dinner. Anything you order will amaze you. I also took my mom here this year for brunch and they have significantly improved in the 2 years. Can't say enough good things about this place! So happy to have you in the neighborhood.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I don't even know where to begin to describe how blatantly ignorant our experience was. We had a reservation for Valentines Day, we arrived at 5:15 and were seated promptly. A nice man came immediately once we were seated to give us water and told us our server would be over shortly. By 6, no server was in sight, but there was a server working in our area who walked by our table numerous times, yet completely ignored us. We were really confused and wondered if they had assigned a server to our table. We continued to wait. The nice man who served us water came back and apologized as he had just found out the waiter hadn't taken our order at all. He kindly took our order. This was very confusing as he was clearly not a server so we did not understand why the other server refused to serve us. We placed our orders and a long while later our first appetizer came. Another long wait, still no server, still no second appetizer. Then finally Jacqueline came and told us she would be our server and our next course would be here shortly. Of course, it took a while longer. But then the rest of the meal came quickly and promptly. The first appetizer was delicious, the second one (scallops) the scallops had a strange taste like they had been sitting out for too long and were starting to go bad, but the beef Wellington was delicious. 

Thank you to Jacqueline and the other man (with the rounded glasses) for saving our experience. However, at the prices you are charging, one would think you would be more organized and treat your customers a little better. Over an hour with no server is kind of ridiculous, especially since every other table around us seemed to be getting good service. It was not a good feeling. We definitely will not be back.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"The steaks are amazing - real Wagyu in Downtown Edmonton, but have you tried the breakfast? 
Service, food, ambiance and restaurant are all spectacular - only problem is finding parking (lol). 
This is definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Edmonton along with Normands, the Local Omnivore, June's Deli, and the Black Pearl.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"We came here for brunch... very interesting vibe... this place and the atmosphere feels like it was transplanted from Vancouver.

I can't quite put my finger on what this place is about. It's a mix between a hipster cafe/fine diner/cocktail bar... maybe this is a good thing but it's kind of confusing, that being said, the decor has set the bar for Edmonton restaurants. 

This space has turned over at least 3 times with different restaurant ideas.. I feel like if DOSC fails, it's going to be an expensive failure... as you can see from my pictures the interior is fucking cool... like Wilfred's cool. When you walk in you are greeted by a bright cafe counter with pastries and baristas... don't be fooled though. The baristas won't take your food order. If you want to eat actual food you HAVE to wait by the door for a server to tend to you. 

Anyways... the brunch menu is very very affordable! The most expensive menu item is $15... but I ordered the poached egg and bread crumb salad and it was $11. This meal has a very interesting texture.. it was made fresh but the bread crumbs are very soft BUT not soggy. The dressing is super light and the poached egg was soft and added a nice touch-- there's also some sort of yogurt cream mixed in... kinda delicious. My spouse got the pancakes and they were only $7! There were 3 cute and petite round fluffy pancakes topped with fruit and whip... delicious.

Guys my bill is was under $20. This gets 3 stars because I am still very intrigued about the entire space. I want to come back for more... I want to check out the cocktail bar/menu... lots to try. I can only give 3 stars because it's my first experience and I am more intrigued if anything. Don't worry DOSC, at least you're doing better than Wilfred's. You guys have great furniture, great food and sensible pricing. Gratis!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
Had a quick lunch here after coming back from Vancouver this morning. Quality food and service. Had a nice chat with Tony and he reccomended the pappardelle for lunch which I enjoyed. Came out to just under $20 with tip and no drink. Will definitely try and come back for some of the steaks which look amazing.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
Brunch here is on point! Great presentation and super tasty. I ordered the hashbowl. Potatoes were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Hollandaise was nice and light and just the right amount. The fresh Pico de Gallo is really what makes this dish though. Yum! The coffee here is perfection. I enjoyed my cortado so much that I took one to go haha. I did not give 5 starts only because the service was slow and I found the amount of food was a bit on the small side.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Our very first meal to kick-off our Canadian Rockies adventure! Edmonton is such a cute and diverse little city with lots of unique places and restaurants. We really wanted to get poutine and bone marrow and DOSC, we heard, serves really good food!

The place was super charming and had a great bar! We ordered their roasted bone marrow and an order of their oxtail poutine. The bone marrow literally melts in your mouth and oh so buttery. Perfectly spread that bad boy on the toasted buttery baguette and take a huge bite. It was nothing but perfection in your MOUTH! The oxtail poutine was so flavorful. MY favorite part was the gravy, creamy and not too salty. 

We also tried the Wagyu Carbonara. This was really delicious - creamy with a ton of wagyu steak in carbonara sauce. We had to take half of it home because they do serve you a huge bowl of pasta (not complaining here!).

The service was so friendly, the food was good. It was a great place to eat before heading to Jasper!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I only came in here for the sober cat and will update my review once I have tried the drunken ox :)

The atmosphere and location are wonderful, I have always been a fan of 104st and this is a lovely addition. The staff are wonderful and very helpful with lots of recommendations for a first timer.

I ended up getting the snozberry kumbucha and taking a seat at the bar to enjoy it. It was pretty early in the day so not too much fuss. 

I look forward to trying out the drunken ox!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Literally Drunken Ox Sober Cat is like a one stop shop, coffee, bar and fine dining steakhouse. The interior is elegant with a touch of industrial gastro pub and amazing ambience all in all. My partner and I went here for a friday eve dinner, it was really busy and packed with good people, the employees are so welcoming and friendly, specially the general manager equally overseeing each table just to check each ones experience. We tried the brisket, striploin and the chicken that got lost! All food were served in a perfect temperature and simple-neat presentation. We highly recommend this spot in Downtown Edmonton, something that we can be proud of! Great job team DOSC.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
Great place.  Lunch has some fantastic options and brunch on the weekend is fabulous. The portions are good and the price is quite fair considering the quality.  What I like especially is the staff friendly and truly want to ensure you enjoy your mean.   Thumbs up for me.  Side note- did not have decaf at first but I asked a few time and the suddenly they brought in decaf.  I feel the were listening,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
DOSC is boss. Cocktails and atmosphere are too much fun.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I would say this is a 4.5 star place! We had a bog group so I got to try a few things. First the wine is decent and it is nice to have a good red wine a steak. The service was good, only being open 2 weeks the server was very knowledgeable and friendly. I had the striploin  and to be honest it wasn't great. My sides were amazing though. The marrow mash is so good and the brussels sprouts are the same and they come in a huge portion. The asparagus also is great but fairly small. Tongue tacos, sounds scary but sooo good! Split a small order with a friend! Worth it. The skirt steak also very yummy and big portions. So the steak is good I just didn't think striploin was super amazing. Its is $$ so bring some money. The ambience is very cool. A fun place to go with friends and definitely a new twist on the old steakhouse favorite!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"My significant other took me here for brunch on my birthday and I absolutely loved it!

The staff were fantastic, super funny and over all very hospitable. I would come here just for the staff alone as they made it quite an enjoyable experience. The presentation and over all atmosphere was just as great! I would love to come here for dinner to see how it changes in the evening. The food was also pretty tasty and it was exciting to try all the different types of mimosas they had to offer. (Highly recommend this for a fun brunch experience!) I would note that my food was slightly on the cold side. Lastly, the female washrooms are also very nice they had bidets as well as a Sage diffuser running.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Came here for my sisters birthday and everything from the food to the drinks & the service was absolutely exceptional! DOSC was the cherry on top of our evening, I would definitely recommend coming here for a birthday or just dinner if you're looking for a cool ambiance & a great dining experience.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Walking into DOSC, I entered a different world. From the luxurious yet quirky ambiance to the impeccable personalized service to the washrooms of the future, I was in heaven. I love having a lot of seating choices and there were elegant leather booths and cozy coffee tables and casual high bar tables and comfy couches under a sparkly chandelier. I chose the booth, which had a perfect view of the open concept kitchen and the bartender shaking up fancy drinks. 

If you are lucky enough to get Bianca, you will understand why I say she is hands down one of the best in the industry. She hails from Australia and I would say is their best export. She was ultra knowledgeable and passionate about everything DOSC. She took her time with us, giving us her best. We left feeling like we had made a new friend.

I almost got lost in the washrooms. Besides the artful decor including wall plants, marble, and copper, I found bodyspray, toothpicks, mouthwash, all the things the ladies need. Not to mention that heated toilet seat and bidet. Because of the extended time I was away from the table, my partner thought I had been on my phone Candy Crushing while on the throne. But actually, I was marveling at the numerous ""shower"" options for the lady garden. There was even a little shelf above the toilet paper roll so you could put your phone since you will be too busy with the buttons on the bidet to get stuck on social media. DOSC have thought of everything.

The food is in a class of its own. Not only have they perfected the plating and presentation, but the quality ingredients are top-notch. The level of TLC given to the star attraction, their steaks translate into the most tender buttery meat that's ever crossed my lips. This place is made for people who love meat or are eating keto/paleo. Just speak your desire, the staff will find a way to make it happen. Drunken Ox Sober Cat is where culinary dreams come true. This is my favorite Edmonton space by far. I can't wait to go back.

Pro Tip: Come on a Sunday when street parking is free",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
This was our first visit and holly molly was it fantastic. Our server Allyn was awesome and his recommendations were on point. He said the Brussel Sprouts were a top seller and OMG...they were amazing. We will definitely be back. Thanks you DOSC for our fabulous dinner experience.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I had such high expectations with DOSC after reading multiple reviews online and following their launch progress via Facebook. It makes me sad to say the visit I had on a Friday afternoon at 3pm with my husband, left us both disappointed.

Before we get to the negative aspects, positive ones were of course the amazing renovations and attention to detail throughout the new space. Impeccable. Even the ladie's washroom was gorgeous and all toilets included a bidet (yup! you read right - not sure how much action those will get...) Service from the hostess was pleasant and inviting.

Now onto the food. We didn't realize that the dinner menu starts at 4pm so were only able to order off the day menu (I had the server double check if it was possible to order off the dinner menu prior to 4 but was told no). The day menu is fine if you were interested in breakfast/brunch items (7/10 items fit into this category) but i found the selection of lunch-relevant items severely lacking. Menu items like Carbonated Fruit Cake, Millet Porridge, Tostada, Coconut Milk Pancakes, Sober Cat Breakfast, Prime Rib Hash & lastly Steak and Eggs are what one would have for breakfast/brunch. My husband and I were not interested in brunch items at 3pm. So the only items left on the day menu were Fries, Crispy Pulled Chicken or Poached Egg Bread Salad as well as three items off their ""Cuts"" menu such as Ribeye, Wagyu Striploin or Wagyu Ribeye.

Also, the items off the ""Cuts"" menu are a la carte so you're just paying for the steak without any sides. 

I would've been happy with even the option of a leafy salad of some sort for lunch but since nothing was to be found, I begrudingly ordered the 6 oz ribeye for $16 and the fries for $5. Whilst my husband, after mulling around on his decision too, chose to order the Prime Rib Hash for $14.

The first thing you'll notice is the portions are super small. My ribeye was pre-cut into slices for me which I found slightly distasteful and it lacked any searing, served at room temp. It just looked extremely unappetizing. The fries (all 6 pieces of them) were crispy but still slightly undercooked. The prime rib hash came with 6 cube-sized pieces of prime rib atop mashed potatoes, some dandelion greens and sauce. The taste was decent but once again not worth the price for the portion.

Our sever was nice enough but lacked warmth.

Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon even though we live nearby and love eating out. I think they have some things to work out - menu-wise. I like the concept of the place though.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"We were drawn to the amazing decor and ambience and it is; beautiful! HOWEVER the food and service ....  2.5 stars 
The meat which they are ""renowned for"" came out fatty,hardly cooked and not fantastic cuts or prep of meat for the price, the portions of the sides were absolutely laughable, 3 mini carrots for 6$? I understand a 'soft opening' is usually a trial of the food (excusable) but the service from the staff should not be a trial!!! Awful service and clueless staff.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I love the interior design of this place, especially their painted artwork and neon lights. DOSC is definitely a trendy place for a good photo op. 

Note: DOSC does not have syrups for fancy lattes like London Fogs, I'm not sure if it was for that day or always? 

Millet Porridge with Mango and Fresh Berries: this was delicious and it tasted like a guilt free dessert.

Fries: these wedges tasted like breakfast hash browns or almost like the Tim Hortons wedges but cooked better. I wish the portion is this was a little bit bigger though.

Steak and Eggs: it was ok, I forgot to take a photo

Tostada was tasty because I love that hint of citrus taste

Poached Egg and Salad: this egg was magically poached because when i poked into it, it disappeared into the sauce. The combination of the bread soaking into the egg sauce was pretty good; I highly suggest letting it soak before eating. I thought there was more to it tho :( with more than one lettuce leaf lol 

I feel like the portions are smaller and there are not a lot of carbs as good fillers. Since they are new, I think there I room for improvement. I'm interest to try and see how the other items on the menu tastes like. I heard the dinner is great.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"If your looking for a chilled out atmosphere with amazing eats! Look no further. DOSC not only has great sharing options, with veggie alternatives and excellent service. Trent is so knowledgeable on the menu and drinks! No parking. The decor is on Pointe! They do take reservations.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Having had proper wagyu in Japan several times, I found the meat quality to be very poor in terms of wagyu and very underwhelming for the heavy price it carries. Perhaps the cuts they serve are a part of the issue but every cut of wagyu I have ever had was marbled with fat and made it very memorable. This wagyu tastes no different from typical Alberta beef. The three stars DOSC gets is for their cocktails and atmosphere. Service was not very good at all, had an empty glass in front of me for well over 20 mins twice throughout the night. Very disappointing experience. Will not return.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
Went here for lunch and had a great experience. Room is very nice and sleek. Service was attentive and the food was amazing! Had the A5 Wagyu Burger and it was a winner. Will definitely be back for dinner.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Amazing decor, wonderful service, good food. And I really enjoy the hipster vibe! I had the breakfast brisket poutine and would give it a 4 stars because some parts of the brisket were a bit hard and dry. But flavour was still great!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"There's no dearth of good eateries in Edmonton; that's one reason I so love my adopted second city. There *is* a dearth of excellent execution: rarely do front-of-house and back-of-house mesh so seamlessly as to spark joy in the diner. DOSC sparked joy.

From the clean exterior fa√ßade to the strong horizontal lines and quirky art of the interior, to the thoughtful elements and equipment including the beef dry-ager to accents in the washrooms, DOSC (Drunken Ox, Sober Cat - a nod to the contrasting personalities of the owners) shows an attention to detail that's vital to curating a good set of courses.

Upon entering you've got a choice between the Sober Cat Caf√© to your left and the Drunken Ox dining areas to your right, within which there are tables and booths. The hunnybunny chose a booth for us. I got to pick that perfect one that gave me a straight-line view into the kitchen and she got the panorama of the goings-on.

Front-of-house was represented by Megan, the barista-on-duty, and Bianca, the 'leader'. (No, really, that's the title on her business card.) Both women were no-nonsense lovers of their domains, sharing their joy of coffee and cuisine, respectively. Best of all, I heard the wonderfully honest words ""I don't know"" on occasion, to be followed up by a researched answer. That's refreshing; thank you.

Bianca gave us an unhurried tour of the restaurant, showing off with pride the kitchen (beautiful views are to be had) and the beef dry-ager and the many cuts of meat on display.

The 'bunny did the ordering for us, picking a selection of items to share. (We've been doing this together for a while, all over the world, so there's rarely anything to worry about.) As apps she chose the beef marrow (with gremolata and a chive baguette) and the roasted butternut squash (with hazelnut, tahini, and pesto). Both were very, very satisfying. I could have used twice as much baguette to sop up all the tasty marrow and drippings. I'm rarely all about the veggies but I loved the punch of the pesto as a counterpoint to the sweetness of the squash. Would order again.

Then we selected a steak tartare; damn, it was good! We've discovered there's a lot of ways to make it badly, and only a few ways to do it well, and DOSC does it well. Much joy in the steak tartare, thank you very much.

There were many menu items I would've tried but for budget and belly; we even took home some of the mains to allow for a dessert flight; details later. Also, I've added pix of most things mentioned herein.

What I am all about is the coffee, so much so that the 'bunny rolls her eyes at my glee (but she lovingly indulges me). I went with a compare-and-contrast coffee flight of one bean prepared two ways; AeroPress vs pour-over. It was *very* impressive, both the differences in the taste and colour. The 'bunny went with a cold brew. She was happy. I believe a caffe Americano and a bit of cream followed a little while later.

The meats are the stars of the show at DOSC. I would have tried each of the ""On Bread"" items, the brisket, the Wagyu burger, and the ""Double DOSC"" (which seems like an elevated White Castle burger), but after Bianca brought out a tray with the various types of Wagyu -- seeing the cuts of meat side-by-side was impressive -- and gave us a run-down on their characteristics I was overridden with more serious-minded choices: a shank (on celeriac), a Northern Gold Angus striploin, and some A3 Snake River Wagyu lollipops.

All the meats were satisfying. The 'bunny grooved on the Wagyu lollipops, I swooned over the shank (which I would never have ordered, having suffered my late father's repeated obsessive love for osso buco), and we both liked the striploin. Presentation was spot-on, each item's taste was layered and delightful to discover. A trivial aside: I had way too much fun with the volcanic black salt and the white salt flakes.

There's no dessert flight on the menu, but it's a clever way to show off the versatility and range of the kitchen to enthusiastic diners; kudos on the good idea. We had, if I remember correctly, a deconstructed cheesecake, a bourbon apple pie topped with cream and candied ginger, brownies encrusted with nuts, and an ice cream with berries. I am not the dessert demon but I thought each was delectable and even better for the contrast of the different dishes.

In fact, in the interests of full disclosure, DOSC was *so* good as to completely turn around our ""fight night"" into ""date night"". Thank you, DOSC. I'm grateful for your staff, your tasty delights, and your relationship balm. The rest of my YEG visit was a joy because of you and although I'm intensely bitter that it'll be at least a month or two until I sojurn again in the Paris of the North and I know that the 'bunny has already booked an engagement at DOSC next week, I won't hold it against you. I'll take out my rage on the rest of your menu upon my return. I'm looking forward to it.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
Love it! Only tried for brunch and coffee but food was great and service was genuine and warm. Can't wait to come back for dinner and drinks soon.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"My only regret going to Edmonton is that I didn't see any cows. However, that didn't stop me from eating some, and DOSC was the best introduction to the Albertan beef culinary scene I could've hoped for. 

Located right in downtown Edmonton, DOSC has got that classy but unpretentious vibe that I really dig. Beautiful open space with rustic furniture, wood beam ceilings, slightly steampunk feels. I love it. Fantastic place to grab a craft cocktail or a great steak, which is exactly what I did. 

Visiting from Toronto, I cannot get over how much steak I can get for my money. A beautiful 10 oz dry-aged ribeye for $42...that's better value than the Keg! And obviously so much tastier. The juicy steak was perfectly medium rare, sitting on a fluffy cushion of garlicky pomme puree. Also go the Oxtail Poutine which was great with fresh fries and savoury oxtail meat but the real star of the show was the Brussel Sprouts. The large size was big enough to share between 4 and the sprouts were perfectly crispy, a little citrusy and a little sweet. We added pancetta to it and it was absolute perfection. Great recommendation from our server, who was also superb! 

If you're looking for a great place for a date, or just craving some good meat, DOSC is the place to go!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"We went to DOSC as a family of four adults looking to have a high end meal. For some reason our host has lately been taking us to  places that focus on alcohol in some form or other. The food menu was 1 page; the drinks menu was at least 10 pages.  Anyway, we looked at the choices and nearly made the mistake of ordering a protein, a starch and a veggie choice for each person. That would have been way too much food. Fortunately our waitress suggested a protein choice and a side dish per person to share and that worked out much better. I bravely ordered the tongue. I had had it in Quebec at my summer French immersion dorm and I liked it then. No one else at my table wanted to try it but it was tender and tasty. The sauce it came with was a bit peppery and a bit sour and to be honest, I don't know what it was trying to achieve but it was easy to work around. 

My fellow dinners ordered the strip loin in two different sizes but it came to the table in two identical plates. Realizing the mistake, a second portion arrived later for the larger sized order so that was a good save. For sides, we ordered Brussels sprouts, fries, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. I didn't get any fries, but they looked good. I had a tiny bit of the mashed potatoes and that was enough for me. They were very rich and had as much marrow as mashed potato in them. The asparagus serving was a bit stingy but only 3 of us like asparagus, anyway. It didn't make a big impression on me otherwise. The Brussels sprouts were generously portioned and interesting. They looked brown, not green, and were served with some kind of smoked pork bits and were tasty and crisp. They were good. 
The cocktail menu was unique but the small print mentioned they would make you any favourites you had in mind. I ordered my usual hot water and lemon and the mug they brought me was so heavy I could barely lift it with my good hand. None of the desserts appealed to me except the one containing walnuts, which I am slightly allergic to. That was the waitress's pick too,so I passed. 

When the bill came our dinner host was surprised at how little it was, since we had almost ordered double sides, but hadn't after all. 
We had had plenty of food and the men seemed happy with their steaks.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Nicely decorated with exposed beams, brick walls, open kitchen.  Made a reservation on a Friday night, and we were seated promptly in high tables near the kitchen. What we discovered was the lighting wasn't bright enough to read the menu, a little better lighting placement would go a long way. 
As we sat, cell phone flashlights in hand, we waited, and waited, and waited.....for service.  We finally flagged someone down, who discussed the menu and took our drink orders.  
Drinks came, and we waited and waited and waited for someone to take our order.  We finally flagged down someone who went and got our server....and we finally got to meet him, 30 mins after we were seated.  
Food is priced reasonably and is good, not exceptional, but good. 
No one ever came to check on us after food recieved or to ask if we wanted another drink until they came to clear plates.
Manager came by and offered us a bone marrow on the house as an apology for the non existant service, nice gesture, but the amount of bone marrow in the bone was not enough to use up the 4 slices of bread.


Decent steaks and starters
Non existant service
Fair prices
Decent beer menu 

3/5

UPDATE:  I was contacted by management after posting this review and we had a discussion about my experience.  Kudos to DOSC for reaching out and doing what they can to make things right. I will go back for another try.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I had the opportunity to go to this restaurant in the winter, when visiting a friend.  I live in a different province and this was the closest restaurant I could find that served wagyu steak.  I was eager to try wagyu for the first time, due to the videos I had been watching of the japanese teppanyaki style of preparation.  I knew that they would not be preparing it that way, but I trusted that it would still be a juicy and tender steak, as wagyu should be.  It had the texture of an overly cooked pan fried pork chop.  It nowhere near resembled the medium rare as I requested.  I actually was chewing tough gristle which I had to spit out, as it was inedible.  Of course this was the steak that was presented to me raw for my inspection before it was prepared.  It is quite the thing for them to cut a too-thin slice off their aged hunks of wagyu.  I assumed there would be no do-overs.  This was after being informed that they were out of the asparagus which was on the menu as being a side for the meals we were ordering, the type of side that is compulsory, not chosen.  All in all it was an overly expensive, and extremely disappointing experience, leading me to never want to set foot in that establishment ever again, and I will be looking to find wagyu direct from the supplier so I can prepare it properly.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I definitely have a love hate relationship with this place and honestly it was really hard for me to decide how to rank it - but I want to give it the benefit of the doubt.
So, parking right off the bat is a little tricky because it is street parking and if it's a busy Saturday night you might have to walk a few blocks. 
The asthetic of this restaurant is BEAUTIFUL : it is a really cool and trendy place. If you want to impress a date and you have enough cash, it's a perfect romantic date spot! However, it's also hipster enough that it can be a good group spot .. again if you can afford it!
As you can probably tell this place is a bit pricey BUT I think that the price point is fitting for the quality you're getting. Of all of the steaks I've had out at a restaurant this was without a doubt , hands down the best. I ordered an ordinary sirloin but it tasted like the most expensive steak I've had... Couldn't tell you how but it did! So good news : if you're not willing to spend too much then the cheaper meat is freakin amazing and you won't be missing out at all! 
One unique thing that they do here is they actually bring out the raw meat to show you your cut and they explain how they're going to cook it - what?? That is super cool! 
We also ordered some side dishes - which by the way .. news to me .. the way the menu works is you order your steak and what you would like on the side separately and there's a really good selection of both!
What we ended up getting on the side was the Risotto and Roasted Butternut Squash. Both of which were super tasty. It was one of those 'you take a bite and close your eyes dramatically' sort of tasty. 
Before all of this we actually ordered the daily bread with some butter which ... The bread was really amazing! Unfortunately the butter was cold and there was no way in heck I would've been able to spread it on but oh well, it was still a dark good piece of bread.
The biggest downside to this place and the reason I had a love hate relationship is because we had a terrible experience with our waiter.
The chef's that brought out the food and the ladies who seated us were fantastic! But, we had the feeling that because we weren't buying alcohol the waiter wasn't too fond of us and quite frankly we were treated like children and were given some of the worst service we've had. I won't go into detail but it was almost enough to make me not want to come back. 
The food was amazing, and everyone else was great. It's unfortunate that we had the experience with the waiter that we did but again I want to give them the benefit of the doubt because at the end of the day one person shouldn't define a restaurant. 
Certainly a place to check out in YEG!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"My husband and I come here once a month. It has the best A5 Wagyu Japanese beef. Service is first class, servers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Yes, it's quite pricey but for wagyu, you get what you pay for. The brussel sprouts is my fav appetizer. It's different but cooked perfectly. This place is a gem!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"What a find, besides the amazing coffee by rogue waves roasters, the food was so delicious! We had breakfast here and was blown away by the flavor of every dish we tried. Very good value for money too!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Not really a steak person (or a meat person,  really), but am all about checking out new places to eat in the city.  

This is not a cheap place to eat,  so be prepared! This is one of those fancy steakhouses where all you get is the meat; sides are extra.  My friends were dying to try the Wagyu: so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. I loved its soft, fatty goodness, and it went down smoothly.  My one friend found it to be a bit too fatty about halfway through,  and both were pretty full even with ordering the 6 oz with no sides. They enjoyed the volcanic salt and horseradish that it came with though.  Was a nice compliment to the meat  I had the wagyu tartare, which,  at $18 for 3 small pieces felt pretty over priced,  but I guess that's Wagyu for you.  The tartare itself was nothing special and when it's chopped into itty bitty pieces, you really can't even tell it's Wagyu We split the beef tongue,  which was also really tender (surprisingly). The sauce that came with the tongue wasn't that great.  I thought the sauce that came with my tartare tasted better with it.  Finished off dinner with a citrus tart(I'm a sucker for yuzu). It was sweet, too sweet for a citrus tart, if you ask me.  Nice and custardy texture though. Is it worth $9? Probably not. 

Free wifi available.  Heart of downtown,  so no free parking.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
The coconut pancakes were very good.  Had it with the chicken sausage which made for a good light meal.  Cost was very reasonable.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Sweet Jesus, y'all. 
I just had dinner here and it was AMAZING. First of all, the service was mind blowing. Matt was our server and he was lovely. I ordered a cocktail which wasn't to my liking, I told him I wasn't much of a drinker so he brought me a replacement mocktail that was delicious- no charge. We ordered two wagyu steaks- the price will make your breath leave your chest but just SPEND THE MONEY. It will be worth it. On the side we ordered the risotto, mashed potatoes, broccolini and butternut gnocchi. The food was taking a while so the best server in the universe swooped in with a bowl of Brussels sprouts to calm our grumbly tummies- again on the house. The mains arrived shortly after- the steak melted like butter in our mouths and all the sides were delicious. We somehow mustered up the willpower for dessert. We treated ourselves to the citrus tart and salted caramel brownie. Again, delicious. The whole experience was so pleasant that when our wonderful server came with the $250 bill, he also brought two house made truffles. Which was a nice change from the usual breath mints you get with the cheque. All in all, if I could give more than five stars I would. Honourable mention again goes to Matt. He was the perfect host, knowledgeable, friendly and funny and took lots of time to explain the menu. Ask for him when you go!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"DOSC has a terrific d√©cor with ample seating and lots of space between tables. Service was excellent and food came very quickly. We were a there for brunch and all our meals were delicious. We especially loved the avocado toast with chipotle as the flavours were fresh and intense.  As you walk past the open kitchen, you'll see the coolers where they dry age beef using different whiskeys and rubs. The longer it dry ages, the more complex it becomes.  I'm looking forward to trying out different ""ages"" of beef next time.  From atmosphere to ambiance, food and service, this place is sensational.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"We recently visited DOSC on a Friday for an early dinner and had the pleasure of being seated with Lisa. She was friendly, outgoing, and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the history of the restaurant/building. We had a couple starters and ordered two of the steaks along with multiple vegetables and starches. Literally everything that came to the table was delicious and cooked to perfection. Overall, we had an incredible evening! Thank you Lisa and everyone at DOSC for a memorable time. Next time we are in Edmonton, we will definitely be back!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I brought my cousin here who is from the states and he wanted a good Albertan steak. He was pleased as we were. First of all it is beautiful inside without being obnoxious. As were the people. They were friendly, attentive and definitely cared about the service and food that they were selling. Super professional. And, if you go toward the washrooms, the meat is on display for you to look at. The foodie in me was super pleased. We decided to spit a few things so we could try them. We decided on the Oxtail poutine - pulled oxtail, oxtail gravy, mozzarella, Havarti, DOSC fries, the seared Brussel sprouts - black garlic foam, sliced pancetta, cured egg yolk and orange glaze, the mushrooms - dry-roasted white button, Portobello, cremini, tallow butter, smoked paprika, herb sal√©e, the  12 oz angus rib eye, the hog wild boar -Five-spice, charred leek & dry-roasted mushroom risotto, boar lardon, collard greens, beet & apple pur√©e and the Falkland isle sea bass  -seared, smoked oyster mushrooms, fish velout√©, braised white beans, fermented tomato vinaigrette. Everything was done professionally and deliciously. Our server came out to talk about the steak we were about to eat and he marbling in it. Everything was amazing. My favourites was the sea bass and the mushrooms and brussels sprouts. The men liked the steak. The only dish that seemed a little disappointing was the wild boar.  The flavours were excellent but it seemed a tough. Our server throughout the meal was prompt and professional. And she was great at offering advice about the craft beer we were drinking. My only issue. The price. It is a really pricey restaurant. My cousin offered to pay which was a blessing, but I wish food like this was more accessible to people that can't afford a 44 dollar steak (with no sides, they are extra). Perhaps their lunch is more accessible? I would love it if more people were able to experience this food that won't break the bank.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Very disappointed with my experience. I ordered an iced tea and brownie. My iced tea took an absurdly long time to make, especially considering the restaurant was not busy. Sadly I was never served my brownie. I waited for staff to come check up on my table but no one came and I was not able to remind about my brownie. When I was paying the bill they tried to charge me for the brownie I was never served. Honestly would not recommend. From my experience it seems the only thing this restaurant has going for it is the decor.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
Very nice.  Out in Edmonton for business trip and hotel host suggested I try it out.  Casual setting.  Went in had a the bone meal and an Alberta steak.  Very relaxing.  Food tasted great.,lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I had high expectations coming here as I had heard such raving reviews. The atmosphere is amazing, but it's disappointing that the food was so mediocre. Upon arrival, my boyfriend ordered a cocktail with liquid smoke in it, and it was one of the worst drinks I've tried in my life. It tasted so overwhelmingly like shoving a campfire into your mouth. He had to call the waitress over to check if it was supposed to be as smoky as it was, and she took it back because apparently the bartender made it wrong. She brought back a fresh one, but our taste buds were spoiled by the first cocktail. She offered up a different cocktail that was supposed to be their most popular one on the house to make up for the experience, but unfortunately this one was equally terrible. It could be from the overwhelming fire taste from the first drink, considering even the water tasted like smoke for the rest of the night, but it was not a well balanced drink. 

The food was overpriced and underwhelming. We tried the spatzle, the wagyu tartare, the Brussels sprouts, a piece of the ribeye and shared the $96 sandwich. The sauce on the spatzle tasted like it was dumped from a jar directly onto the noodle, with no flavor or warmth seeing as it was essentially cold. It was supposed to come with pieces of pancetta, much to my surprise, considering we dug around our dish in search of the meat after seeing cubes in our friends identical dish and found none. The wagyu tartare was good, albeit a little bland and the Brussels sprouts tasted the same as you'd find anywhere else. The ribeye was the highlight of the evening, since it was well seasoned and very tender. The sandwich was the biggest letdown. You simply cannot charge such a high price point for a sandwich with such little flavor. The only redeeming part of the night was the impeccable service. Our waitress was so inviting and charming and she was really lovely when dealing with the drink complaints! 

When a meal is priced at this level, you'd expect it to be a truly unique dining experience but everything we had here did not live up to the expectations. Maybe we came on an off night, but safe to say I won't be returning for food.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"The old Ric's Grill has been turned into a couple different incarnations since the chain when belly up and this is by far the greatest of them. It's now the ultra cool Drunken Ox Sober Cat...an absolutely chic space with a menu and food quality to match. It's a pretty standard ala carte steakhouse menu so the price tag can get up there but trust me it's worth it.  

We took out booth which had a view into the open kitchen and away we go...After a couple delicious cocktails the scallop appetizer arrived. Stunningly cooked with bits of bacon and micro greens. Couldn't of asked for a better start. 

Now there are some crazy expensive cuts of steak available including a $172.00 Wagyu strip or ribeye...I'm sure they're delightful but a bit much for this couple. So we instead decided to try both the Northern Gold Striploin and it's buddy the Northern Gold ribeye. I mean we couldn't really decide and why not compare and contrast right? Both steaks were easily top 5-10 steaks I've ever had. If you've read some of my other reviews I've had pretty much the best YEG has to offer in the moo department and this legit was maybe the best in the city. Immaculately seasoned and cooked..amazing beef flavour. We paired it up with some buttery roasted fingerling potatoes which I can't say enough good things about and some brilliant roasted carrots with a kind of salsa verde. They were crispy yet tender, a definite deft touch from the chef..pretty much the perfect steak dinner! 

I was so stuffed I could only watch as my date devoured a pineapple cake..she's pretty partial to pineapple to begin with...but she was in 7th heaven! 

The wine selections aren't huge but certainly varied and appropriate pricing for anyone's budget. And I can't say enough about how awesome our server was. More than knowledgeable about the menu and wines, and took excellent care of us 

This is legit a 5 star experience...do yourself a favour and check it out, I cannot wait to go back

Cheers 
Andy",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw

"DOSC = Drunken Ox Sober Cat and they're all about the beef!
This restaurant is great for a special occasion meal. My lady brought me here for my birthday and it was a great choice. 
This location used to be a burger joint but it has been completely overhauled and renovated. The front of the shop is like a cafe offering coffees and pastries. The back of the restaurant is quite a bit more dimly lit for a romantic feel. They have an open kitchen concept and a private dining room along with a full bar. 
We ordered 5-6 dishes, a virgin cocktail and a glass of wine and the bill only came to $72 before tip. That's pretty good for a unique and memorable dinner. The main meat dishes were an 6oz ribeye and a 5oz skirt steak. This was more than enough meat but we added an oxtail poutine which was loaded with pulled beef. Now for some of you that are poutine nazis you may not like the three cheese mixture instead of the cheese curds but the flavour was worth it. We added some greens like the brocollini with a bechamel sauce and the Cabbage Kale Salad which is basically a coleslaw.
They provided dessert for free since it was my birthday and we chose the honey cake. I'm not a dessert guy and I still really liked this cake. It wasn't too sweet but it was quite flavourful. 
I'd definitely come back here to try the wagyu beef. The service was efficient and friendly and I'd like to support local businesses where possible.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Food was mediocre and pricey but the customer service was abysmal. I had the Grandin fish and chips and it was not bad, but I found the portions a little small. The customer service was something else. Multiple times we had to ask for something which the server forgot. It seemed she simply did not care",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Steak was ""ok"". Had Wagyu steaks at $118 each. It's a different steak. Not worth it IMO. I like the typical steak.  Staff was ok but we had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes for our food ""because we had a very large table order"". That was a LONG wait.  Initially when we got there, our reservation put us at a table with stools so we asked if we could have a booth instead.  There were 3-4 empty booths.  After waiting 10 minutes, the waitress came back and accommodated us but not before lecturing us about ""if you wanted a booth, you should have requested a booth. Next time, when you make a reservation, request a booth""... Well, news flash, there won't be a next time.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"The two stars are for the ambience of the restaurant. It has so much potential in being a really cool new trendy restaurant but the food is terrible.
Was extremely under whelmed with the food , especially the meat which it's suppose to be known for.
Over priced food for sure. Meat was tough and cooked opposite of what we wanted. Was told the Waygu beef is "" melt in your mouth"" meat and yet trying it we all were chewing for minutes to get it down. 
Customer service was also very lacking , not helpful as it was our first time there and was not helpful when told our meat was cooked opposite of what we wanted. 

Very disappointing night out, especially when we were all Bearing the winter cold to come and try this restaurant !",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Great food, good value. Every dish has lots of flavour and I loved all the different cuts of meat that were done excellently. Tongue tacos, ribeye, skirt steamk. All great.

"Drunken Ox by night, Sober Cat by day!

I was introduced to DOSC by a friend and have been there for both late night dinner and for weekend brunch and I can 100% say both times are freaking delicious. 

Let's start with the venue - DOSC is located on the corner of 104st and 102 ave. When you first walk into the restaurant there is a clear vibe that the front portion is set up to give the Sober Cat cafe vibe while further into the back sets the atmosphere for a modernized evening, or lunchtime, dining experience. The restaurant is super clean and you'll definitely have to check out the bathrooms (girls at least) - decorated still in a modernized style and with individual stalls fully equipped with bidets and heated toilet seats. For me, the venue of DOSC says ""we can have it all"".

Moving onto food and service. As I previously said, both brunch and dinner were delicious although I think I was actually more impressed with the brunch. Don't get me wrong, dinner was amazing. The selection of melt in your mouth meat (all cooked beautifully) and sides was phenomenal and made for a perfect sharing experience. It gave everyone at the table the ability to try a variety of dishes while still being full but not over saturated with one flavor or item. Considering DOSC specializes in steak and meat, dinner can be a little bit pricey but not overboard. I am a firm believer in paying a little bit more for high quality food and this is exactly how I would describe dinner at DOSC. 

With that said, I think when I went for brunch I was expecting it to also be on the higher end of cost with smaller portions but I was pleasantly proved wrong. Their brunch was reasonably priced and there was a good selection. I think I paid roughly $7 for buttermilk pancakes and something like $13-15 for lovely version of steak and eggs (I was super stuffed by the end of all of this). I can super picky about pancakes so I was incredibly impressed by their pancakes that came with fruit and a coconut pairing. In addition, the steak and eggs were cooked perfectly and the meat was, again, super tender and amazing. 

I would absolutely go back to DOSC for either brunch or dinner but I suppose I should check out their lunch menu sometime too!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Rarely does a restaurant arrive into Edmonton that I want to be successful so bad. The concept is great. The menu is immaculate. The atmosphere is posh. The location is perfect. Drinks were quenching. The food? Inconsistent. 

Came for both lunch and dinner both on weekdays. Both times were quite busy so I'd recommend a reso to avoid any hold up. Upon first look of the place, it oozes an old school NYC bar aesthetic and it immediately had me excited for lunch. City Farm Pate wasn't that great, didn't spread that well and only had 3 pieces of tiny subpar bread. Pappardelle was great for a vegetarian dish with a light garlic taste. Confusing that they call it pappardelle when it isn't that pasta. Skirt steak and strpiloin were fine, but the brisket was so drab. Brisket was just sitting in a small bowl of bland broth with just made the meat flavorless. I've compared pics of my brisket with others and it seemed pretty inconsistent.

Dinner was a whole different beast. We capitalized on that Wagyu lifestyle and a huge Bone In Ribeye. Made a huge misteak on the wagyu by getting it medium rare when they serve the meat so thin that it should be rare. Ribeye was coma inducing and just a different variety of flavors depending on where your piece was cut. For sides we had Bone marrow mash and brussel sprouts.. Couldn't really find the marrow flavor in the mash, but the sprouts was great.

Located on the corner of 104st and 101 ave, this location has a bad reputation for closing down. I hope this time it doesn't happen. The drinks are great, food is not bad and atmosphere is something you won't get anywhere else in Edmonton. 

Sal says: Just Try It (3.8/5)
Sergio says: More hits than misses for me, might need some time to get into the groove of things. Skirt Steak, dry age striploin, pate, and pappardelle were great; while the brisket and meat on loaf were a bit dry and bland. Will need to try more of the breakfast brunch items.
Chloe says: Delicious delicious drinks. Looking forward to the bone marrow mash but they fell flat. Until the next day when I mixed it with their butter. Sublime. Bacon and Brussels sprouts very cool.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw

"Recently stumbled upon DOSC on a quiet Saturday night downtown. We were served by Kathleen and was absolutely blown away by her charisma, service, and attention to detail. She explained all the menu items to us  and we ended up with her favourites. Both the poutine and brussels sprouts were a must try. After we asked on places to go next, we found out that Kathleen has only been working at DOSC for a week! Amazing service, vibes, and food!",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"DOSC, it's in downtown.  Street parking.  Inside is big, open and airy.  I've been a few times. I would suggest a reservation no matter when you go, even if there's almost no one there when you arrive, I've always been asked if I reserved.
All the food I've had here has been delicious and beautifully presented.  I continue to go back for rib eye and red wine and then order vegetable dishes because it seems wrong to just have beef and wine....
Service is professional and attentive.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"I went here twice in one day because I was so blown away by the service at lunch. DOSC stands for Drunken Ox, Sober Cat as they have an incredible cocktail situation in there but also a very elegant coffee shop. 
The decor really blew me away, so much attention to detail, I especially loved the artwork above the entrance to the open kitchen with the mountains and constellations. There are fun neons, to be found in murals too. 
Nice booths and bar area. The bar stools contrast against the gorgeous tiles at the bar look so good. Honestly I could go on and on about the decor but I'd rather talk about the toilets (seriously). The ladies bathroom has bedits and heated seats, it was quite the talking point at our table. You'll find sanitary products, mouthwash and more in the washrooms too. 
We only ordered a few small plates as it was lunchtime but the poutine was really stand out for me. That gravy was super rich! I want to go back and try some more meat items. Washed it down with the Rose and Leaf, a refreshing gin cocktail that called me back later in the evening.",lPPYZr1_jx0XeW-xR9WJtw
"Eh, by the standards of round eye buffets, Szechuan Paramount Restaurant is alright.  Yes, the decor is solidly stuck in the 1980s, but the servers are both fast and friendly.  The food is that gloopy battered deep fried crap that so many in the West seem to prefer, but you'd know that going in if you've ever set foot in one of these Chinese buffet places here in North America.  I can cross it off the list now and will be unlikely to return for any reason.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A

Food was really good, could have been a bit fresher, the poor spring rolls were dripping in oil, they must have been bottom of the barrel. Our beef and greens were just beef and  broccoli and carrots, no other veggies in it. Also- I didn't find this to actually be Szechuan. Still good, would probably give it another chance.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A

"The food here is ok, but nothing great. Dinner was $20 per person on a weeknight, which I thought was way overpriced. Dessert selection was seriously funny because they cut the squares into a tiny piece, hardly big enough to fill your back tooth. Friendly people, but hovering isn't a great thing when you're trying to eat.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"My boyfriend's family has ordered from this Chinese restaurant for many years. We never dine in, we always do either delivery or take out. The food here is consistent and you get a lot for your money. It's not overly greasy or tasteless and has good texture. Unbelievably, since we've moved to St. Albert, they still deliver to us and the delivery folks are always friendly. Would highly recommend it for particular Chinese food fiends!!",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"Very disappointed in our order tonight always order the same things. Special chow mien, sweet and sour pork, special mixed greens, and curry chicken. It wasn't very hot when delivered the total was different than told at time of ordering. Fish and chips with fish had to be nuked to be eaten sure hope the non chinfood person doesn't get sick. His was so good he threw out the extra piece of fish that was ordered. Will be a long time before we order from here and we've been regular customers for years.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"So glade got the flyer in mail. We've ordered a dozen times and went to eAt the buffet on Christmas Eve. I've tryed a handful of chinese restaurants around trying to find something similar as my favourite back home and this is about As close as I've gotten. The wonton soup is up and down with me as I do prefer the beef one back home and this one tends to be up and down, I love it more when the broth is stronger. Could do without rice as I find the steAmed and the chicken fried rather bland (I know what your thinking but again comparing it to back home where it's flavourful). We usually end up getting chicken balls, sweet and sour pork, chicken chow mein, lemon chicken and switch it up with other things.. Again all that is on par and I love it.. Comparing the chow mein though again could do without if my boyfriend didn't love it as I find the sauce in it kind of bland. The one time we tried spring roll i found it rather gross as I hate the chinese spice or whatever it's called in it that tastes rather like cinnamon so we
Both ended up throwing that out. As for the buffet it's a nice little buffet with all your basics and was rather impressed they had 2 different shrimps, muscles etc. I don't go for that but my bf and his father loved it and loaded up on those. There dessert side is underwhelming but let's admit it you don't go there for dessert. Although something besides  premade stuff, puddings and jello would be nice. All in all this is my go to place when I'm craving and can't make it home. It is rather busy so make sure your there early if you plan on eating in there but for the most part we order in which I prefer",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"I've eaten here 10+ times, decent priced buffet and there's more to chose from
On the weekends, they keep
It clean, stocked up and friendly staff",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"If you like Chinese food don't go to this buffet . Substandard food, the chow mein was a disgrace. We would never return again. Friendly staff, good service",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"i visited this place recently after a long while. it has improved alot!!! 2 kinds of shrimp and it was shelled, fresh beef. last time i was there we had shrimp , they were small and with shell and dry....and ate just those. beef was rotten...looked from yesterday....check it out over weekend.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
Food was decent. Buffet moderately priced. Where they lost me is charging $2.75 for a CAN of pop. Get bent!,qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"A serendipitous find...we happened in for the buffet. It was fresh, tasted great and the service was super friendly. The chicken balls had a good size of chicken in it, unlike many other places and were not over-fried. Each entree had it's own flavour rather than tasting like generic mall food and the desserts were varied and fresh. Pudding, cheesecake, cream puffs, ice cream. The manager was on hand & very friendly. Would reccomend & return!",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"I was here tonight with 5 of my lovely women friends.  The service was very thoughtful and timely.  Food was wonderful and fresh.  Although most people were here for the buffet, there were some who ordered off the menu.

We were laughing and enjoying each other's, company and the servers kept on refilling our tea pots without asking....and even came back twice to fill our water glasses.  They really went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

I was complaining because this restaurant is quite a distance from where I live and I wish it was in the west end.  If the owners read this...please open up a location in the west.  I have not found a great Chinese food restaurant yet west of 149 st.

The decor is a bit dated, otherwise this would get a full 5.  For what it is, good fresh Western Chinese food, it is definitely worth a 4.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"I can't wait until I finally become a senior, because then I can finally get 10% off the buffet at Szechaun Paramount. 

I like coming here for Chinese food, and I've been coming here, since I was a kid. It hasn't changed all that much, except that the buffet has increased in size significantly. It's huge, so there's lots of items to choose from. They have the usual Szechaun items, like ginger beef, spring rolls, deep fried shrimp, rice, noodles, beef & vegetables, and wonton soup. The food is pretty good. A lot of it is greasy, but not overly greasy. I would say the food is somewhat better here than the House of Quon. 

The restaurant is nice, but not overly fancy. You can come here dressed in jeans or whatever--it's very casual. I have ordered takeout from here too, and it's good. You get 10% off, if you pick it up and pay by cash or 5% off, if you pay by debit or credit (I always thought that was kind of unfair). Szechaun Paramount is just a great place to gorge on some decent Chinese food.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"My family has been ordering from and occasionally dining in this restaurant for at least 20 years. I have yet come across a fresher and more abundant Chinese food buffet.

The dining area is always clean, tidy and decorated nicely. The food is always well stocked and there are desserts a plenty. The outside of the restaurant and the surrounding area might seem a tad sketchy but it proves that looks can be deceiving! 

Take-Out is what we do most. They always deliver within a reasonable time and I can't ever remember not getting exactly what we asked for. Most importantly it always tastes amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that this place deserves 5 stars.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
Horrible. The lady at the counter was nice but the girl bringing us to our table looked miserable. Wasn't very welcoming. This is my third time there and never again. Not much variety and not much food. We went for the dinner buffet. Most of the food was hard and crusty. Like it was old and sitting there for a while. My boyfriend went and got dessert. The cheesecake is a tiny tiny ass square. The jello he got had a freaking fly in it. Dead of course but a freaking fly. We showed the girl and she just said oh and took the piece the fly was in. No apologies no nothing. I should of took a picture. I'm asian and I love asian food and wish I could write a good review but that would be a total lie. It was very disappointing and a waste of our money. Disgusting and really bad service. Don't waste your time or money.,qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"Ordered dinner for 2, and chose Szechuan Beef, Lemon Chicken and Chicken Chow Mein.. We didn't see on the Skip app that this would include chicken fried rice and two spring rolls... so that was a pleasant surprise. 

Overall impressions- everything was hot, and presented well... everything looked good overall, and was well-packaged. Portions were very large.... Order included all condiments. 

1. Szechuan Beef- not spicy, medium at most. Dad liked it, mom complained. Dad said was good, crispy, flavoured well.... Not chewy, which is sometimes the case. 

2. Lemon Chicken- very fresh and crispy... loooots of batter... maybe more batter than chicken, however that's not a bad thing for some. 

3. Chicken Chow Mein- the chicken wasn't great... kinda like it needed to be cooked more (or browned), kinda like boiled chicken... whole dish was super oily and not really the chow mein we usually like.... The veggies were crisp though. 

4. Chicken Fried Rice- overall good. Plenty of chicken.

5. Spring rolls- great. Crispy. Bonus.

Although we give it a 3.5-4 we think there are better options out there. Definitely okay though.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"Fast delivery service. I was told on the phone, 40 minutes wait. My food arrived in half the time, the food arrived nice and hot. The szechuan beef arrived nice and crispy and not soggy.

Their website could use a update with current prices.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"This place may be getting a 4 star from me partly because I'm nostalgic. I've been coming here since I was a young thing and have probably been at least 40 times over the years. We also order takeout every couple of months as well. When you walk in you will be greeted immediately and seated. We normally get a pot of tea and water with our meal. 
The decor is dated as one other reviewer mentioned. Carpet is always near impossible to keep perfect in restaurants- so I can't say I fault them for that. Washrooms are small but clean. 
The buffet includes 2 choices of soup, hot and sour, and wonton. I always get the wonton and that is probably the weakest part of the buffet. They do need to work on the wontons- soup lacks a bit of flavour and the wonton meat is not ground finely enough. 
The rest of the buffet really does it for me though. It's not perfect, and it's not high end, but they always have little green onion cakes, spring rolls, wonton wrappers, pork dumplings, deep fried shrimp, chicken balls, mixed greens, chow mein, shanghai noodles, sprouts, beef in black bean sauce, Kung Pao chicken, ginger beef, mushroom, and a sweet and sour fish with pineapple that I love. If you go on the weekend buffets they have a spicy fried shrimp that's not deep fried and it's so good. 
Dessert is an odd yet satisfying mix of little cafeteria jello and pudding cups with little tarts or squares. 
Buffet for two and a pot of tea was $40.85 tonight- I think the weekend one might be a few dollars more for increased selection. 
Worth noting we love ordering the Singapore noodles from here. Never part of their buffet - but they are the best!
If you can get over not fancy- and you're feeling a buffet- recommend!",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"I'm loving my yelp app we have eaten at places I never know existed and can fine any kind of food I'm looking for like a Chinese buffet for a late lunch and I was not at all disappointed. 
The food was good with nice selection even at the end of the lunch buffet. The service was prompt and friendly. 
The restaurant was nice even the bathroom had a resent face life and was clean. 
We will be back next time we need a Chinese food fix.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"We were driving on 97 street and saw  this restaurant advertising Szechuan food and decided to try it and therein lies the problem.

First, and most importantly, there isn't a single dish offered at this buffet restaurant that is Szechuan. Not one. I was stunned. Not even chili oil, an absolute must for any Szechuan dish. This is Cantonese food and should be described as such! 

Second, the food choices for the buffet were few; although what was available was generally well prepared. The spicy shrimp were very good. But, at $21.00 per plate, I think the food is overpriced.

If you are not bothered by issues of authenticity, then you might find this an enjoyable meal; however, if you are familiar with the different and wonderful cuisines of China, then you will be sorely disappointed and I recommend you look elsewhere for sichuan food.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"I was supposed to go in Pho song but I did give this restaurant buffet a chance. Buffet is $21++ smorg has lots of variety however food is not appealing. wonton soup not so tasty and as you open the wontons, its meh. Chow mein and fat noodles are like dumped in soy sauce and dry. Chao Fan, same thing its like they added soy sauce dry, even close to its original state. I wouldn't like that to feed in my body. Good points dry ribs, ginger beef honey garlic tempura(normal thick batter) and i didnt skip the dessert chocolate pudding was awesome. Lastly, iced tea... $2.95 cents over priced. Verdict: not going back to this restaurant at all. You are what you eat and this is not a good restaurant for good quality food.",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
I ordered my meal and when I went to pick it up they had no history of my order. I reorder the same thing in store I was gonna step out for air when I heard the manger tell the cashier make him pay first!! Never going back racists,qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"Was looking for a buffet that wasn't going to be too expensive and came across this restaurant. At $19 for the buffet, I wasn't going to complain. My expectations are never high for a buffet and as I expected the food was nothing spectacular. Not saying it was bad, it's the same quality I've gotten from other smorgasbord restaurants. 

However, the service was excellent. My glass was always filled with ice water without having to ask and the dirty plates were taken away promptly. They were very polite as well!",qS4CaO_u_vMrTl31XJto1A
"Just walking on a freezing winter day. Needed something hot and tasty. DId not disappoint. The springs rolls are a good size and you can choose pork, chicken or veg. We had the chicken and they were great. We both had King size portions, chicken & shrimp, satay beef . Tasty and hot! Service is fast and friendly. We'll be back again.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Pho king is always reliable. Broth of soup is the best. Owners friendly. Food is cheap but quality is there.,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Accommodating, tentative, delish! Will for sure recommend. Yum!",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Excellent food that reminds me of Vancouver. Always fast and delicious, and reasonably priced. The restaurant itself is quaint and clean, we will definitely come here on the regular.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"So I am redoing my review after the last couple of times we ordered here. I am not sure if it is because they expanded but food stunk. The salad rolls which should have shrimp in them were mainly stuffed with noodles, bland because no Thai basil and had barely any shrimp. Sauce that came with them was watery and too sweet. The rice paper was already ripping when we opened the  container. The pork and shrimp dumplings were an odd orange colour and we could not distingish what was in them...didn't taste like any meat at all. the squid was mostly not. Tonnes of peppers, barely any squid. The vermicelli bowls were okay but not super flavourful. Went here for years and years, I will not be going back.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Walked in on a typical weekday afternoon, the place is reasonably clean with 4 customers already in it.  Ordered the special pho, what I always order when I first go to a new pho place.  The price was very reasonable, sub $10 for a large bowl of pho.

The condiment choices were good, nice amount of basil, sprouts and chilli.  Sate and other sauces were all present.  The complimentary tea has a very unique flavour to it, I am not sure what it is but I did not enjoy it.

The pho came fast, hot and fresh, a good thing.  The toppings look good, the portion was generous but the broth was very dark.  On first taste, the taste of soya sauce in the broth was overwhelming.  During the whole meal, I just couldnt get over how overpowering the taste of soya sauce and how salty the broth was.  

I went there on the strength of the reviews here, it may be just a bad day for the chef but based on the bowl of pho I had, it only deserved a ""Meh"" rating.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"This is by far one of our favorites for pho in the city. We've been here many times and they are quite accommodating to my family. And on the offbeat chance the kids are not up for pho, they do appreciate the western menu.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I love this restaurant. It's inexpensive and the service is friendly and fast. The food isn't fancy but it's good. Overall, it's perfect for Sunday mornings when you're getting a late start and can't remember how your waffle maker works. Also, there's all-day breakfast: one of the best things mankind has invented.

Some of my vegetarian friends joined me here and found a decent selection.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"You know when the Pho craze started a few years ago you always heard about those ""meh"" places that were riding on the coattails of the pho hype? Yes, this feels like it was one of them.

I went with a large satay soup. The broth was overly salted and uninspiring, the size was medium at best and amount of toppings left me disappointed. I think I will skip this place next time.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
I love your food but the fact that I called 40 freaking times trying to order and was sent straight to voicemail each time pissed me off so much I'll probably never call for take out again. If you're stating that you're open and do take out and someone can't reach you during business hours thats completely unacceptable.,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I read an add in The Tomato magazine a couple of weeks ago that talked about the revitalization of 118 ave. I noted a couple of restaurants that I wanted to check out.  As I am a big fan of Pho soup, Pho King was first on the list.  I was not disappointed in the least!  The service was right on key, pleasant and efficient.  We ordered the empire rolls and Pho soup.  The presentation was above and beyond  any other Pho soup establishment that I have been to in Edmonton.  Lastly, the flavor of the soup and roll were exceptional, and highly recommended.                 

Enjoy, The Soup Queen",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"After cancelling all my weekend plans due to snow, I decided Friday night for me would consist of a bottle of red and takeout. Pho King is nearby and it has a hilarious name so I had to check it out.
I'm a fan of Vietnamese food so I ordered a few dishes to share with my family. The first was Grilled Lemongrass Chicken that comes with rice and salad. The chicken was very tender and thankfully the lemongrass flavour was not overwhelming, as it sometimes can be. The other dish was Stir Fry Beef which is nicely balanced with lots of yummy veg mixed in; cabbage, carrot and broccoli. Next time I'll opt for noodles instead of rice though. We also got a few spring rolls, they have beef, pork or veg. I had the beef roll and it was very tasty. I hate it when they are all stringy and dry. These spring rolls were packed to perfection, not too big so you can eat a couple and not ruin your main course. The dipping sauce was a winner and gave a nice fish/vinegar flavour to the pastry.
We were after take out but the restaurant looked very pleasant and they have free wifi. I'll go back and sit in so I can have the pho, which has some great reviews. 
The server was very nice and really fast - he advised it would be a 10 minute wait but it was nowhere near that long. I'm not sure if time went in fast because I was laughing so much at the  shirts and caps that are for sale. They obviously have a manager with a sense of humour and now I want to buy a 'Pho King Delicious' T-shirt.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I would give this place 3.5 if there was an option. Not much to look at in the exterior or interior, but is clean. I find it strange that the bathroom is a few degrees colder than the rest of the restaurant.  So this is not a place where you linger over your green tea and chat. However, the owners are friendly and it is often full. Extremely reasonable, tasty Vietnamese food. I was there with a bunch of friends, so we decided to split a few appetizers. We ordered Green Onion cakes and spring rolls. It took us awhile to get the server to get our order but once we did, the food came out in a timely manner. Piping hot and tasty. I ordered Kim Chi fried rice dish while my friends ordered vermicelli bowls.  My rice was tasty but perhaps too acidic in nature. My friends ordered the Kings special vermicelli bowls which they were pleased  with. No surprises, no exotic combinations, but fresh tasty food. If you want a quick, cheap, tasty dish pop in to this establishment.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"We were in the neighbourhood for an earlier evening event. I remembered how much I enjoyed this place in the past. So I suggested we walk over for supper. 

I still like this restaurant. Friendly service, large portions and speed of food service is consistent from when I was here a few years ago. We all enjoyed our meals and didn't feel rushed to leave our table.

However the years seem to have caught up to the place. Floor is noticeably worn down where the chairs are sliding back and forth at the tables. Bathroom was tidy but nothing exceptional by any means. Definitely want to watch that slightly raised floor going out of the bathrooms or that could be a tripping hazard. Everything is decently clean within the restaurant but this would only be a casual lunch place for me in the future.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I also tried Pho King on the strength of yelp reviews, because I do love Vietnamese food but I've had definite mixed results trying restaurants in the area.  Very happy with the food, very happy with the price, very happy with the service.  My boyfriend enjoyed his lesson in how to drink Vietnamese Coffee, and we both really enjoyed the relaxed, genuine friendliness that can be a hall mark of area businesses (yeah, that's hit and miss too, but when you find it it's pretty sweet).  Point deducted because they could swing the mop a bit harder, but eh, I have an old place myself and know full well how you can spend a day sterilizing the place and have it still look grungy and smell old, so if I could do half stars I might have been more generous with that benefit of the doubt in mind. The food was fresh and the plates were clean, after all - I wasn't eating on the floor anyway.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Decent Pho. Had the steak, flank and tendon. Generous portion of meat.  Meat oddly flavourless as if it had been boiled.  Broth decent but not fabulous.  Green onion cakes were good.  The service was quick and very friendly.  We will stop by again if we are in the area but are unlikely to make a special trip to eat here. It's a place that could grow on you.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Is this the best Pho place in the city? 
I'm not sure but it's darn tasty. 
I really enjoyed their soup and noodle. Good price as well.
Great green onion cakes (tip dip it in the broth)

The salad rolls we got (beef and shrimp) were only so so.

My favorite part is the name ....heh pho king. heh.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"So for soup, aka, Pho, pretty good. But if you're in the mood for vermicelli, I would look elsewhere personally. Ordered the chicken vermicelli. The chicken was actual bland and tasteless. None of those amazing Vietnamese sauces or char on it. When I order chicken vermicelli, I want that delicious Vietnamese bbq sauce combination, (that I can't reproduce at home, no matter how many times I try), on my chicken. Maybe they just forgot to baste my chicken this one time, but we're all pretty judgmental on here as reviewers. We can only review what we eat. 

The plus side is they actual have pretty awesome Pho.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"They are closed for one month holiday for the family.
The whole experience the food, friendlinessp more.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Oh, that name... now on to the food. 

When this was the only game in town (or on 118 Ave at least) this was pretty great stuff but since then others have come on the scene and changed the standard. Now the food seems just OK. 

I have been here many times and ever time the word that comes to mind is sloppy. Don't get me wrong. The place is clean and received a nice reno some time ago. It's not the atmosphere but instead the food. It feels like the kitchen just isn't worried about the little things and so the dish feels slapped together. For example, I had the King Special Pho recently. While eating I found the largest single piece of tripe I have ever seen put in a soup. I love tripe but it works best when in smaller pieces spread throughout ever bite. The crunch from tripe is a perfect balance to the softness of the noodles. In this case almost all of the trip was in one ginormous bite. On top of that the broth was mediocre at best, tasting more of onion than of bone. It made for a sour flavour overall. Sloppy. 

As for other items on the menu the sloppiness continues. The vermicelli bowls seem haphazard and a little dry. For the price they now charge I would expect more. With new competition in the area I would expect them to step up their game.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"This is one of the best!  I have ate here several times and all but once the Pho I had was excellent!  A pleasent mixture of broth, noodles, meat, and onions that you top off with sprouts, minte leaves, hot sauce, and a touch of hoisen sauce makes this one of the best noodle houses in the city.  It is both authentic as well as cozy.  Oh, by the way, try the spring rolls! Thay are to die for.

This a very small restaurant with limited seating, however, they have absolutely everything you can imagine on the menu.  From full breakfasts, including bacon and eggs, to a lunch menu that includes every kind of fast food you can imagine!  Not very7 good for any kind of group event but at the same time it is great for you and a couple buddies to enjoy Western, Chinese, or Authentic Vietnemese quisine.

For less than $15.00 plus drinks you leave extremly satisfied, so the prices are as great as the food, however, a little work on consistently good food is a must for the little restaurant to stay at a 4 star rating.  Out of 4 or 5 visits here, I found 1 time to be very unenjoyable.   If you catch them on a good day, look out!  You taste buds are in for a real treat!",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Have to say I'm not that impressed. Figured it was worth ordering after looking at reviews. Ordered take out and It took an hour and a half. Peanut sauce smelled a bit like stinky feet but the rice vermicelli was alright. Nothing worth more then 1 star!! Its a shame since I LOVE Vietnamese food! Yuck!,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Not suitable for vegetarians. Broth is either beef or chicken. They have a tofu stir fry and a few veggie appetizers, but the stir fry was bland and soggy. Good appetizers, though.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho. 

The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Oh delicious Pho. This is one of the best places in the city for Pho. They have renovated the place fairly recently and it looks quite nice inside. Nothing fancy but it's clean and comfortable.  

Their Pho broth has to be some of the tastiest I have ever had. If you order the king size your likely only going to be able to finish half of it as the bowls are massive.

Definitely a place to check out if your having a craving for pho.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Quick service and a good meal for a reasonable price. I like that people in this restaurant from other tables talk to each other and ask questions about what you've chosen or what you're drinking. Has a real community feel to it.,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I have been driving by this place for the past couple weeks to find the blinds down each and every time, so i was so excited when it was open today!

Place is clean and has an old diner feel. Unusual that the menu also offers some western food options. I didnt even bother venturing into those lol. 

I got p1, their pho special, size small at 7.95. Service was fast and the basil+beansprouts were super fresh! I loved the broth - clean tasting and very flavourful. I liked the broth as much if not better than the broth at tau bay (which seems to be edmonton's golden standard for pho). There was also a good portion of meat, lovely long thick strips of tripe, and tons of ooey gooey tendon! . Unfortunately the rare steak was a bit more done than i wouldve liked, but i was all about the noodles!!! Omg perfectly chewy! Heaven!! And the owner even came to check on me. Omg that is unheard of in an asian restaurant!! 

So.. 4 stars for great broth, good proportion of meat to noodle, and fresh garnish, as well as good service. Will be back, and often :)",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Tried their grilled chicken with shrimp vermicelli, the dish is good although the fish sauce needs to be a bit salty as its a little bland when mix with the noodles. The spicy beef noodle soup is good and I like the beef balls very soft and juicy. Service is fast of you want to go around lunch try coming at 12:30-1pm to beat the rush lunch hour.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Went here on a late Sunday afternoon with a friend and her little bro. First time eating at Pho King and it's like most Vietnamese places in Edmonton - small, family run, slightly grungy but cheap, good food.

I had pho a few days earlier so I decided to order something different:
- R4: Grilled lemongrass pork chop and spring rolls ($9.95) - the pork chop was tasty but a bit on the greasy side. Came with two spring rolls, rice and side of cold veggies.

My friend and her bro had:
- King's special beef noodle soup ($9.95 for king size) - she liked it but said it was bit on the salty side.
- V13: Pork spring rolls ($8.45) - you get 4 spring rolls I believe, vermicelli noodles and veggies with a separate container of peanuts.

Food hit the spot as we were hungry. Didn't even have any leftovers. Service is fast. You pay up front as is the usual case. Menu is pretty interesting/weird/random - Western breakfast options and burgers...at a Vietnamese place. Someone try these and let me know how they are. Haha. Other than that, good food and cheap. 3.5 stars.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Pho King opened up in the neighbourhood about a year or two ago. Since then we've ordered in/picked up a couple of times but had never eaten in the restaurant. Whenever we ordered out, me, my dad and husband would get one of their vermicelli noodle bowls that come with spring rolls. I was always impressed with the taste of the food, as certain Asian restaurants have been really hit and miss for me. 

We finally decided to go into the restaurant this past weekend to try out their namesake, pho! I went with my husband and a girlfriend. We shared green onion cakes ($2.25) and six dumplings ($4.95)  to start. I really love dumplings, and quite enjoyed these pork and veggie filled ones. I had the P3 - brisket and flank pho - regular size. very reasonably priced at $6.45. The bowl was a little bit smaller than others I've seen, but still huge and I still didn't finish it! Nothing to complain about with the flavour - I enjoyed it! 

Service was quite fast when we first got to the restaurant. The waiter took our order and our food came out quickly. Once we had our food, though, we didn't really see him again. Maybe once. The restaurant is small and he was never far, so if we did need him for something we could have gotten his attention easily. This might bother some people, but it was kind of nice that we were left to just linger and chat for two hours on a Friday night.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Yum yum yum!!!! My go to place, everything is fresh. Family owned and they care. 
I have tried many pho places I usually leave feeling bloated and heart racing. Then we'll you know what happens next a trip to the........
Not here though, that makes me so happy. I truly love their broth. 
Thank you pho king!",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"It was almost a year since I moved to Edmonton before I discovered this place but I am glad that I did.

Located on 118th ave, this is your typical Vietnamese family restaurant.  Nothing glitzy or glamorous, your typical asian diner type establishment.  But they offer solid food at reasonable prices.  I have tried a variety of items here on 3 visits and all have been good or great.

The pho is good, comes in different sizes with all the usual accompaniments and is very filling.  I just need to remember to ask for my beef on the side as I prefer to have it rare vs cooked by the broth.   

Their vermicelli bowls are satisfying, large portions and again they have the usual accompaniments like shredded carrots, cucumber and lettuce   Salad rolls are good and they also have green onion cakes.  Yes, I realize that's not a Vietnamese thing but I like them and am happy to see that they are ubiquitous in Edmonton compared to other Canadian cities I've lived in.  

Overall, a solid choice for Vietnamese food on the north side.  Give it a try for a bowl of warm pho on a cold day and you won't be disappointed.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Fabulous vermicelli bowls, salad rolls, wonton soup, etc. 
They try to serve western foods with the standard burgers & breakfast items, but go with the Asian food. It's worth it.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"One of the best viet noodle bowls I've tried ! And a very good price, I had chicken and prawns which tasted very fresh and not greasy at all,I intend to go back, they also have western options and a great breakfast menu",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
We have always loved the Pho King and used to bring my boys when they were little . Great place to take them when you want to bowl of pho and they want a burger or pancakes . It's been a few years since we've been and realized that it was a mistake . Best pho ever I say ! Best spring rolls and love the shrimp tempura! Now my grown boys want to meet me here cause they love Pho too,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Pho Kings has good food with friendly service. Recommend to come if you enjoy Vietnamese foods,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Some of the best value and delicious Asian food I have found in Edmonton. Great service, delicious Pho and authentic ( I feel like I can say this because a Vietnamese friend said so). If you have some time on 118ave it's worth it to go here for lunch or dinner!",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Chicken wings with the best stuff on them ever!  Wow. Yep. Very true food here. Hold your heads high you know what your doing you guys!!,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Great place on Alberta Avenue for Vietnamese Food.  Under new ownership and they have elevated their customer service and food is great.  Always a friendly smile when you enter and I never have had a bad meal!,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I came across this small dine in dine out restaurant many many years ago, same owner same staff still until now also family run. Pho and everything else on menu is to die for,  quality and quantity has always stayed the same or just got even better over the years. I would recommend this place to anyone, I guess based on the other reviews I'm not the only who praises this place.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I stopped in for lunch yesterday and had a large #2 (brisket pho) and a Vietnamese-style iced coffee. Service was efficient, and the price seemed good at first: $7.45 for a large pho and $2.95 for the coffee.

Pho has three basic components: the broth, the noodles, and the meat. The pho I had at Pho King was mediocre on all counts. The soup had generous amounts of lean, tight-grained brisket, but I was disappointed to discover that it had a leftover taste, as if it had been cooked two or three days prior and refrigerated. Bleh. The rice stick noodles were overcooked. They broke apart as I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks. The broth was weak; I had to add salt to it, and I've never had to do that at other pho restaurants! I know when pho broth is good when I want to keep eating it even after the meat and noodles are gone. I had no such desire at Pho King.

The coffee was disappointing as well. It certainly tasted good, but the quantity served was remarkably small for what they were charging.

I won't be going back to Pho King. For a good bowl of pho, I recommend Pho Binh off Stony Plain Road.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Service was warm and friendly, but food did not meet expectation. Nice small location",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"This is my home away from home. The owner aims to please every day!  If you have kids they get a big freezie  if they finnish their dinners! Recently they had some renovations done. And it looks amazing!  
I really love how convenient it is for me and the price is reasonable. The food is constantly fantastic! 
My favorite is P5",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"You can tell that the broth is made from scratch. Apparently took 12 hours! Love the side plate with fresh peppermint, bean spouts, lime and hot peppers. Healthy food, delicious flavour. Restaurant is clean and service was courteous and prompt. They have had a few health inspection violations this year and for this reason they get 4 stars (if not I would have given them 5 stars). They weren't huge health violations but important nonetheless.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"A bit of a dive, but that's part of its charm. Food was good and well priced, service was what you would expect.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
My favorite pho. The broth is so savoury and satisfying! The family is so sweet and the Dad (Owner) always gives a Mr Freeze to the kids after their meal. Diamond in the rough! Support local business!,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Living only a few blocks away, I have eaten at Pho King many many times. The food is always very good and consistent. Service is quick and friendly, and it always seems to be full of regulars. I have tried many of the vermicelli dishes, pho, spring rolls, green onion cakes, and everything is excellent. This is my go-to place for Vietnamese.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Best pho in the city no comparison! Service is excellent food is even better love coming here with friends definitely recommend to all pho and noodle lovers.,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Ordered chicken spring rolls and #P2 pho with beef. I really like how hot and fresh spring rolls are made here, most places sorong rolls are only warm.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Pho King is king! I am a pho junkie and I like to try different places but there is no beating Pho King for pho in the city of Edmonton. 
I have never ordered anything but pho and salad rolls but I see others eating a variety of other dishes so I imagine everything is delicious. 
The pho comes out hot and quick. The broth is tasty and not too salty. It's a little heavier than most and I like that. I either get the well done beef or the brisket. Both meats are delicious and nice cuts. I'm picky with meats and there's nothing about the beef in this pho that grosses me out. The kicker in pho king pho is not only scallions but it's garnished with some raw white onion which makes a world or difference. Served with a big heap of sprouts, lime, a chili and the usual condiments on the table. The noodles are dense and delicious. The pork, shrimp abs tofu salad rolls are all amazing. Not too sticky, there's cucumber in them and the peanut sauce is excellent. 
It's dingy but clean and unintimidating. The young guy who's always serving is a real pleasure.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Pho-king amazing. Delicious food, nice people, great service - and that was for take out! I HAVE to go back and try out the sit in version of the Pho King experience. 

Pho King has been on my radar for a wee while now, but I never seemed to be venturing down 118 to check it out - I'll tell you this, it's well worth the trip. 

I went for one of the vermicelli options - chicken and shrimp, my lovely partner in crime grabbed pork and spring roll whilst my veggie friend had a fried veggie stir fry with veggie spring rolls and my other buddy went for the Pho. All were reported as being delightfully scrumptious. 

I'll definitely be checking out Pho King again. 

So good I bought the Tshirt!!",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"I've seen reviews and a few pretty sweet instagram pics from this place, so here we go! 

We walked in and were instructed to sit wherever we wanted. Great, no waiting. We picked a spot by the window. We immediately received menus and our drink order was taken. Tea for me, Vietnamese coffee for hubby. Our order was taken very quickly, and drinks arrived soon after.

We got an order of 4 spring rolls to share, decent flavour, but curious that there was no chilli garlic sauce on the table. We made do with sriracha and chilli oil. No biggie.

Hubby ordered the pork & spring roll vermicelli bowl. Also curious was the fact that the noodles were served warm in this dish, as they've been served cold every other time he's ordered this dish elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad thing, the warm noodles actually elevated the flavours in this dish. The grilled pork was excellent as well. Yum!

I ordered a regular P1 w/no tripe and extra tendon. The soup was good, flavourful broth, tasty meatballs...but I did not receive the extra tendon I asked for (I have no problem paying extra for this if required). There were 3 tasty, but small pieces in there. One other thing, the noodles seemed to be freshly cooked rather that pre-cooked and added after. A small but nice touch. 

Once our food arrived, we had no other interaction with any staff other than when we got up to pay. No one asked how our meal was, no one brought us the bill. Almost like we were a nuisance, bordering on feeling like we'd been dismissed. Ok, so no warm fuzzies here. 

Good food, hot soup, chilly service.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Offering friendly service, Pho King makes a good bowl of pho tai.  It isn't the best, but it isn't the worst by a long shot.  Recommended if you're in the area.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
Reasonable price. Foods pretty good not a bad place to check out.,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Alberta Avenue boasts restaurants from just about every major ethnicity in Edmonton. However, Vietnamese noodle houses appeared to be missing. Until now. Pho King serves a variety of beef noodle soups and vermicelli noodle dishes, as well as some Japanese dishes like stirfry and tempura. For those who don't care for Asian food (but may be at the restaurant with someone who does), some Western fare, mostly burgers, are available. The most unique aspect of the menu is the all-day breakfast, featuring eggs, pancakes, and breakfast meats. Prices are in line with restaurants in nearby Chinatown.

I had the beef vermicelli bowl with spring rolls. I opted for the veggie spring rolls (I don't do pork) and as always I held the fish sauce. The spring rolls were crispy and tasty. There was a lot of salad on top (not under the noodles) keeping it cold and crisp. The noodles were somewhat chewy and clumped - my only criticism. However, it was the beef that was the star of the meal. Two large skewers of grilled, lemongrass beef that were very juicy, thick, and flavourful. The skewer make it somewhat awkward to eat, but certainly not a deterrent. 

A friend who showed up later ordered the same meal (with the pork spring rolls and fish sauce) and also commented on how thick the meat was compared to other versions of the dish. Interestingly, her peanuts were served in a separate plastic container. I did not receive peanuts at all - probably because the server assumed there was an allergy issue (ordering something without fish sauce sometimes leads to such an assumption). 

Great food, service, and prices - I am going to have to head to Alberta Avenue more often!",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Very good pho! One of the best broths in Edmonton. Bright natural lighting. Excellent service and seemed very clean on the front end. 

Another plus is they serve western food if you are in the mood for pho and someone you are with wants a burger. They also have all day breakfast.

My wife took our kids to bathrooms which she said where gross and stunk. A good cleaning would be advised. Kitchens looked very clean though from what I could see poking my head around the corner.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Good Pho, a little bit expensive for what you get but  still very affordable.  Restaurant is small and needs an update, but if you are looking for good Pho this is a good choice.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Years ago it was a couple stars higher on the pho scale for me but they closed for renovations
last yr for awhile and when they re-opened i went back and the pho wasn't all that great.
The broth was blah and noodles not cooked properly really.
The whole package was lacking so i haven't gone back.
There are so many good other places now that it's not necessary to drive all the way over to this one.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"With a name like this, it is unsurprising that Pho King has T-shirts and ballcaps for sale. The food was certainly worth it! I enjoyed some fried tofu and a curried chicken on noodles dish on my latest visit and the food was really quite good (that fried tofu was delicious!). I also enjoyed my tea.

The bathroom was clean if a bit bizarre looking aesthetically. A popular place to visit in this area, I am pretty happy with the food quality and would certainly return.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Came here after swimming and so the whole family was famished. Nothing like pho on a cold day.

We had chicken dumplings which were excellent. For pho we had a king size beef with noodles and regular beef ball. Both came out steaming hot and yummy. Broth had good flavor but was not too salty. You know it's good when you finish everything including the broth.

Staff and owner were very friendly. Quite busy but they were able to seat us. Parking is a little problematic as they have a small parking area. But there is plenty of street parking.

Really hit the the spot. Owner said Happy New Year on the way out and seemed to really appreciate the business.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Pho King. Such a cleverly named restaurant. Have you seen their brand/logo design? Amaze balls (buy a t-shirt!). I've hit up Pho King a few times by now (good spot when you want something quick and easy before hitting up Rexall Place) but this was the first time I've been to their newly renovated digs. Everything is much cleaner and aesthetically pleasing. The right hand side of the resto now consists of a counter instead of seating area.

A and I stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was reasonably busy with several tables full along with a few people popping in to pick up takeout orders. The menu is extensive with your typical Vietnamese offerings but they hilariously have a full page dedicated to Western foods/breakfast meals. Random but it must cater to the clientele in the area???

I'll never understand why so many other Viet/Asian places in town do this. Take a page from Pho Tau Bay's playbook and focus on one thing and do it well. Bonus, they're open everyday of the week (Sunday's now!).

- Bun bo hue (P18) ($10.95 king) - I went with their bun bo hue because I've never had it here before. The broth was fragrant with a good depth and flavour profile. I found it to be a bit on the lighter/cleaner side if that makes any sense. The meat balls were delicious! A little bit of green onions and sliced onions gives their bowls an extra zip of flavour. Good stuff.
- Grilled lemongrass chicken with kimchi (R23) ($13.95) - A was having some trouble deciding but eventually went with the grilled lemongrass chicken skewers over rice with a side of kimchi and vegetables. The lemongrass chicken had an odd texture to it that I can't even put in writing. It was cooked fine but it must have been the cut of meat that they were using. She only ate one skewer and I ended up taking the rest as leftovers. As for the kimchi, it wasn't very good -  kind of flavourless and a chore to eat. Blah. This is why I rarely, if ever, veer from ordering pho at Vietnamese spots.

On a previous trip, I went with a buddy before an Oilers game where we each ordered pho:
- Seafood noodle soup (P17) ($10.95 regular) - a couple shrimps, kabuki, and shrimp balls. The broth was great - flavourful and clean tasting! Sort of sate style but with just a bit of spiciness to it. Definitely would get this again.
- Rare steak and meatball beef noodle soup (P8) ($8.95 regular) - my buddy went to town on his bowl. There was nothing left after we finished devouring both of our bowls.

Solid spot to grab a bowl of pho. Prices are reasonable and service is fast. Slightly ghetto area of town but that's part of it's charm. Don't let that hold you back from trying out Pho King.",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
They need to get a better solution to there phone service or upgrade they're system online for online ordering. Trying to get through can be a maddening/frustrating experience that's also the reason for the low rating. Turns out that they are temporarily closed for renovations.,wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
"Very mediocre at best. Figured I'd try some delivery from here to see what the hype was about as I love pho and feel a cold coming on, wanted something spicy. Ordered spring roles, green onion cake and extra spicy beef satay. The spring roles were alright as well as the green onion cake however nothing special. The soup was not spicy at all And rather tasteless. I ended up spicing with my own sriracha hot sauce at home. Pretty disappointing. Service was friendly and delivery was quick, the food was very hot on arrival which is always a plus but I probably will skip on pho king again!",wqj6JquckEOs1h7rs376kQ
I often forget that this particular Subway location is there. But that's sometimes a good thing because when other fast food restaurants in the area had long lineups this location was nice and empty so I could get my sandwich quickly and efficiently and relax there on a Sunday afternoon for example. The staff member there was very efficient and the seating area while small was quite ample for my needs.,yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"the best subway in the area by far. staff are polite and very fast. they make a note to know their regulars and remember orders. everything is always clean and stocked and if something isn't they will get it for you right away. the biggest thing for me and why I always go here is the bread. it's always baked to perfection. very rarely will it be over baked, dry and fall apart while you're trying to eat it.",yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"Best Subway in central Edmonton. 

The location is always clean & staff is speedy, courteous, and generous with toppings. I have never had a bad sandwich from this location & I have been eating here for the last 9 years!

Keep up the good work!",yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"After driving around trying to decide what to eat I decided to get a subway melt. This location is typically not bad, but my last experience here was unacceptable. After watching the employee scratch her hair with no gloves on whilst making my sandwich, once it was finally ready and to be wrapped up, she literally coughed in my sandwich and wrapped it up. I didn't even know what to say. I just stood there in shock and awe. She coughed again. I just walked out. Never ever coming back again. Aside from that, the sandwich meat had green corners. That struck me as odd. Maybe a blessing in disguise that the employee working coughed into my sandwich. Cannot trust the food or the people preparing it at this location. Jesus fucking Christ, what a disgusting experience.",yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"This Subway sucks and my opinion is 100% based on the staff.  They're always so confused and confusing.  Every staff member seems to be on their first day of the job every day.

Parking also sucks.  And it's stupid busy at peak times.",yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"When it comes to Subway's the product is pretty much uniform across locations as long as they keep fresh buns and toppings on hand. Most of the difference I believe is when it comes to staff, customer service, cleanliness, and the location.

I came in one day for lunch when I was between meetings and in the area. It was just starting to get busy for lunch so there was a bit of a line-up. By just starting to get busy I mean there were 2 people that just finished paying and I was next and then 2 people behind me and people were starting to come in behind those people. So by any means I wouldn't not consider that a huge line-up at all.

My main reason for giving such a low rating is purely the dysfunctional layout of the store. As you move down the line towards the till you are herded into the corner where the pop vending machine is and all of the eating utensils and essentials. So this design pushes people into a tight corner where everyone is in each others way. It is very uncomfortable to say the least. It isn't a huge store...maybe 20 seats in total perhaps. There must be a better way to lay things out to better control the flow of customers but it may take a bit of remodelling. Personally this dysfunctional layout would prevent me from coming back. It is just too awkward and uncomfortable of a location. Hopefully they can remedy this at some point. If so I may revisit and update my review.",yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"Every time I go to this location, it's nothing but problems. The staff aren't always friendly. You have to correct them in terms of your order constantly. And don't dare order through Uber Eats with this location. You order an iced tea, and they think it makes sense to put it in a fountain drink cup; And then a plastic bag. You order soup, only for it to not show up. You call them to complain, and they tell you ""We never had soup to begin with."" Take your number, tell you they'll call back in '1-2minutes.' Then never do. Not pleased!",yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"I am a fan of this particular location.  If you have to eat fast food, at least Subway is not full of greasy hamburger that you will regret in a few hours!

The staff at this Subway are friendly and efficient.  You get your sandwiches the way you like them and they are FAST.  

I have never had to search for parking, there is free parking right out front.   

Great food, fast!",yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
Love this subway.  Always clean and tidy inside.staff are friendly and build your sandwich how you want it. Not skimpy on toppings and they take their time without rushing or trying to just get you through the line.,yDriUh65Wpx1HnTmXln9nw
"This is pizza to die for and it won't leave you feeling like a 500-lb dough boy (or girl) after polishing off a whole pie. Seriously, once you start you can't stop. It's made of imported San Marzano tomatoes and flour from Italy and the light crispy crust is cooked for only two minutes at extreme heat, 'Neapolitan' style. As the story goes, the owners are three buddies, one of who visited Naples, Italy and fell in love with the pizza. He called up his peeps and said they ""had"" to open a Neapolitan pizzeria, so the guys went to pizza school in Naples. Famoso came into being soon after. I had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozza, extra virgin olive oil, fresh basil leaves, roasted mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. The only downside is you order and pay at the cash register, to speed up orders and accommodate busy lunch crowds, no doubt. But I'm sure this idea would never fly in Italy, where the people have mastered the art of slow living. What the hay, it still deserves four stars. The coffee's great to boot.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I go to the downtown Famoso... a lot. I'm trying to cut back to once or twice a month instead of once or twice a week. 

This is probably my favourite pizza in town. The crust on its own is delicious, and the toppings are good quality and fresh. And fast! I think my longest wait ever was about 10 minutes, and that was unusual. This is also a good place to go if you just want a dessert. The Nutella pizza is amazing, and they have tiramisu and gelato as well. And the coffee is good too. Mmm Nutella mocha.

The downtown location is probably the most popular, and I think the smallest. If you go on a late week/weekend at supper time, you might have to wait a little bit. But most of the time it's not too bad. 

The way you order/pay is a little different here from your standard restaurant, and I think they are working on some new system where you can order and pay at your table. But mostly you just go up to the front to order and pay, and then they bring your food out to you. 

They also do takeout. For those days when you want to eat fancy pizza at home in your sweatpants. No delivery though. Plus this stuff is best super fresh.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"The most strange experience dining out I've had in years. We sat down at our table and then was informed that after waiting for our booth we had to go wait in a separate line to order our food. There were no waitresses at Famoso's, instead you go and order your food and pay, then someone brings you your pizza. You get your own forks and knifes and napkins.

You pay everything upfront so you have to decide if you want desert before you order or if you want 2 or 3 beers with your meal. I guess you could keep running up and waiting in line to order them but I don't understand the system here at Famoso's.

When our pizzas came they were okay I suppose. Thin crust like I expected but very wet & soggy. Everything was made fresh though so I can't complain about the taste, just getting it into your mouth is the hard part as it sags just below the crust. 

Also the place is very small and a lot of people are just kinda hanging around the place like its some club. They were waiting for take out pizza and for tables, and at one point I had a few people hanging around my booth actually leaning on my seat and his buddy was staring at me trying to get the soggy mess into my mouth.

I don't understand why this place was so much money for a pizza if it's mostly just self serve. The personal pizzas range from $11-15, and for a bottle of beer you are looking at $5 domestic $6 imported.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"This is the original Famoso location and it is the only one that still feels ""home grown"" and least like a chain. It is great to see all the employees pitching in (you even see the owner making pizzas!) and really working together for the whole restaurant.

This location is not in the best neighbourhood... I was once enjoying my dinner in their outdoor section and an unkempt man off the street came up to us and started asking for money. Parking is also sometimes an issue. They have some dedicated stalls right in front of their restaurant but it usually isn't enough for all the patrons. Aside from that you have to fend for yourself when parking in the lot or on the street. I am only rating this place 4 stars because of the location...

Having said all of the above, the food is top notch. I love the thin crust pizza - all of the thin crust pizza. Every single one I have tried I have adored. They also have a small pizza and salad combo that is a nice change from time to time. The Napoli Salad is my favorite - such great flavor combinations with all the ingredients and dressing. Then you get to dessert... they have a nutella and banana calzone that is topped with whip cream and caramel sauce... to die for. I just cannot say anything less than superb for all of the food here. Only adding to the greatness is the knowledge that they use some ingredients imported from Italy (like flour) and all the rest are fresh. They hand make all the dough and sauces, so you know as little preservatives are in your food as possible.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Oh how times have changed. I recall my first visit to this location 10 years ago. It was almost like being back in Italy. The crusts were light and crisp with just enough give and pull, the sauce was pure San Marzano tomato... but that's not what I had this time. I had an over proofed and rubbery crust, poorly tossed and formed. Bland splotchy sauce, no visible signs of fior di latte cheese and sporadic blobs of greasy poorly cut soppressata. I know it's hard to find good staff that give a damn, I know not everyone can make the trip to Napoli to learn the craft. But when you call yourself famous and you're being trained and modeled after the home of Pizza you gotta stay with it. Any Pizzaoilo from Naples would have their head in the oven after eating this. Folks time to re-evaluate what you're doing and if you've lost the passion, close the door and move on, but don't do this to Pizza. Please!!!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"This restaurant is just downstairs of where I live. I went to have a Italian cheese pizza last night and it was gorgeous! I had Italian coffee too. It tastes extremely smooth. The dessert I chose the first one on the menu, can't remember the name anyway. I think it's a little bit too sweet and milky. You may choose others if you are not a ice cream hunter. 
Those waitress are very nice~~ 
I saw some of the guest ordered beckon pizza. It looks awesome.  
The restaurant is not very big. So for group eating, may not be an idle place. Four people are perfect.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  The crust was excellent,  but the sauce tasted like warm tomatoe soup.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"If you are going to go for Famoso, you mite as well go to the OG! I love the Oliver location; sitting out on the patio, people watching in the summer. Or sitting in the big glass windows in the winter as the snow falls. The pizza is always fabulous, for a fair price. The wine (although no longer is their a wine club, boo ALCB) is decent and well priced. I love, love love the Prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls, oooo, they are a must! The salads are quite good and very large for sharing, the spring/summer special, panzanella salad with fire-roasted croutons, cucumbers, red peppers, radishes, cherry tomatoes and fior-di-latte cheese is such a different and salad for summer, I loved it! My favourite pizzas are the Prosciutto Arugula and the Vesuvio. But, they are probably all good.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"It would be safe to say that pizza is my favorite food. I mean this in the way that if I was in jail for something awful and had to ask for a last meal, it would be pizza. Seriously. And if I got to be choosy about where the pizza would be from (I doubt they give you those liberties in jail, but I digress) it would be from Famoso. It is that good.

I have never been to Naples, but I almost think that if I didn't go, I would be able to die happy knowing I experienced the closest possible thing to it's authentic pizza. The crust is just to die for - it's thin but chewy and moist and so wonderfully different than the american style pizza we consume regularly. It doesn't hurt that they use an imported low-gluten flour, so you can eat a whole pizza and not feel like completely garbage afterwards. The ingredients are fresh and authentic - I also love their seasonal pizzas. The summer San Andreas is one of my favorites, amongst many others.

The service is very good, all though they do it differently. You seat yourself at a table and go up to the counter to order. Then a server brings you your drinks and meal as they are available. They used to ask you to pay as you ordered, but I've noticed that they don't allow that option anymore (probably to keep the upsell option open - can't blame them, the gelato is worth a try). 

The menu is different. I've brought friends here that were completely underwhelmed with the experience because they expected the typical pepperoni pizza slathered in rubbery mozzarella. Famoso doesn't do it that way - they offer a lot of 'authentic' italian pizzas. My boyfriend is a big fan of the proscuitto and arugula. I lean towards the quattro fromaggi with mushrooms. They DO offer some of the more 'americanized' toppings, such as ham and pineapple (all though I do believe it's a type of italian ham). Being a pizza lover, I don't really find an issue with the lack of 'normal' pizzas. But some people do.

I also don't mind the extra price you pay for the experience. The pizzas are cooked in less than 30 seconds and made right in front of you by a line of very talented chefs. They average around $14 a pizza. You can share a pizza (they are pretty big) or you can have your own. So the cost can be pricey if you are used to the menu of other pizza chains, such as Pizza Hut or Pizza 73. I do wholeheartedly think this is more of a ""quality verses quantity"" place.

The menu also offers wings, salads (so good - and you can order them on top of a pizza crust, which is a nice twist), desserts like gelato and tiramisu, appetizers, alcoholic beverages and coffee/espresso.

They have an option for kids - ordering a smaller size pizza (I believe it's a 5 inch, I may be wrong) and you get a free scoop of gelato. They've also been offering a ""pizza and movie"" option for the past year - only valid during the weekdays, I believe. You buy a pizza and add on an extra $6 and get a pass to go to a Cineplex movie. 

The reason I didn't 5-star this review was because it is a small, louder-atmosphere restaurant and it can be difficult to find seats during the dinner rush. The majority of their seating is on high stools at high tables, and I find sitting up high to be a little bit uncomfortable at times. They do offer booths, all though I think the downtown restaurant only has 5 of them, and only one of them seats more than 4 people (so having a large group here can be a bit of an issue). The patio is quite nice, however it is just off the west end of Jasper, so you may see or hear from a colorful character on the sidewalk. Parking can be a little bit of an issue - Famoso shares it's parking lot with On the Rocks and a small grocery store. There are some meters across the street as well and you can always try and find parking a few blocks north in the residential area.

I love pizza, and I love Famoso. It's different, it's fun, it's delicious. One thing that they aren't lacking is passion for their craft and that alone is worth giving it a shot.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
Ordered delivery-meatballs were horrible and pizza was nothing special.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso is taking the concept of Wood Fired Pizza and franchising it across Canada. But I believe this is the original location. 

And while Famoso is committed to using the authentic ""00"" flour for its dough, Famoso isn't above offering pineapple as a topping. My wife insists on eating her pizza with pineapple as topping. As Famoso's thin crust tends to be spongy and flexible, rather than cracker-like, Famoso crushes its pineapple, rather than serving it with larger chunks. Larger chunks would create too much of a mess and make the pizza difficult to eat. Famoso's crust may not be stiff, it never becomes soggy. The pizza was a winner - by far the best I've had in Edmonton, but I'm still no Edmonton pizza expert yet.

We also ordered a sandwich made out of the same dough  - the Sophia Loren. But as the sandwich lacked a sauce, I found it to be dry and boring. I need tomato sauce, or cream sauce, or mayonnaise, or aioli on a sandwich. The extra virgin olive oil, oregano and minced garlic spread didn't cut it.

Also, a significant number of tables at the pizzeria are bar-style high tables. And these tables do not have a place to rest your feet, resulting in the placement of your feet on your chair directly beneath you. I did not find this comfortable. And I like comfort when I go out to eat.

I have to give Famoso props for offering a great Groupon ($20 for $40 worth of Food and Drink) and for employing servers who believe in the Famoso concept.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
Great variety of pizza. Awesome gelato. Chocolate Fudge is the one to have if you are a chocolate fan!,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"What could have been a very bad experience - was a very positive experience! 

Let me explain... After hearing great reviews of this place my boyfriend and I decided to check it out - on a Friday night....

Well of course it was very busy when we arrived, and there was a line out the door for a table - the place is fairly small so we decided to wait it out. The staff offered wine and beer samples, and garlic pizza bread to those waiting in line. 

After around 45 minutes of waiting we got a table. The staff are super friendly and our waitress asked if we had  been there before or not - we of course said no. They pride themselves on the fact that it only takes them 90 seconds to cook a pizza. 

We each ordered a pizza...Mine was spinach and feta. After around 30 minutes of waiting for our pizza, and watching tables who were seated after us receive their food we started to wonder what was going on. Our waitress took note of the situation - after saying it only took 90 seconds to cook a pizza, knowing it was our first time there, and then watching us wait for so long - she knew it would be a bad first experience. 

She called the manager right away, and checked into the ticket system with the pizza makers. Apparently our ticket was just being over looked. The manager came over right away and apologized - we did not even ask to speak with anyone, or bring it up with the waitress, she did this all on her own. We were offered two free gelato's and beverages for the mix-up. Which is more then we bargained for, as we really were not complaining. 

With great service like that - you really can't go wrong. It goes to show they really do care about their customers. 

The pizza was delicious and the gelato was very tasty. Ever since then its always been a favorite pizza place.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso is a great place for thin crust pizzas. I am really pleased that they switched from going up to order to having sit down service.  Our server was friendly but was quit busy. Probably should have more help because our water glasses were empty a lot of the time.  The menu has a nice selection of tapas, pasta,  sandwiches , and entrees.  However,  when we come here we usually stick to the thin crust pizzas. This time we chose the margherita,  prawn pesto, and the capicola ham and pineapple.  I have to say the margherita was a little disappointing,  it was soggy and sad looking.  However,  the other two pizzas were really tasty.  The 12 inch is a great size if you are hungry for lunch.  I have also had the tomato bisque soup and it is delicious if you want something lighter.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I reviewed this original location when it first opened, but somehow that one has evaporated. I hadn't been back here for a while and it continues to serve great pies.  The renovated entrance has improved the congestion at door.

This trip we tried the Blanca, which was a  nice change from tomatoes and meats, but the appeal wore off after a slice or two.  This would be great one to share with a group, so everyone can try something different. The Siciliana was absolutely perfect -- the sauce is divine and that thin, quick baked crust is how all pizza should be.

My only gripe with this chain is the poor quality of the Parmesan cheese. I just don't understand why they offer that awful, powdery stuff to put on such a quality pie.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Oh hey there vegan pizza.  In Edmonton.  Alberta.  What?!

SO EFFING GOOD.  I had the Napoli salad and the Primavera pizza with pineapple instead of cheese.  Aaaaand it was prolly the best pizza in life.  Seriously.  

Thin crust cooked in some magic Harry Potter oven so it only takes 90 seconds to cook.  It's not greasy at all, so it helps the justification speech you are telling yourself about why it's cool you ate the whole bloody thing.  My pal had the Spicy Thai pizza with cheese, and it didn't appear greasy either - just perfect baby amounts of cheese.

Then to top it all off the nutella dessert pizza came out.  Woah.  

The staff was super friendly, helpful and patient.  The one girl gave me a lovely virgin speech about the low down of the place.

I might have to eat here a few more times before I head back to Vancouver.  Or bring some franchise rights with me.

You Edmonton peeps win this Pizza round.  Jealous.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"LOVE IT!! Tried Famoso over the weekend after hearing good reviews from some friends. Our starter, the flatbread, and pizzas were amazing. I do not want to eat pizza anywhere else! Would absolutley recconmend it.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I've reviewed Famoso before, but yesterday was the first time I'd ever tried their gluten-free crust. I've recently had to switch to a gluten-free diet, which can be pretty tough if you're a huge fan of pastas, breads, and pizzas in particular. The options at restaurants can be pretty slim and I'd pretty much assumed pizza would be off the menu for me from now on (other than Costco's frozen GF pizzas, of course).

Luckily for me, Famoso has introduced a gluten-free crust. And it's actually quite good. Not that I didn't look over in envy at my friend's beautifully puffed-up crust once or twice, but that's just how it is. It's thinner and it doesn't puff as much, but the gluten-free pizza is still soft and chewy and was proportioned perfectly with the toppings. I ordered the margherita with cooked prosciutto and roasted mushrooms--my favourite. 

The overall verdict? I really enjoyed it. I'm very impressed that Famoso has delivered such a reasonable workaround for the gluten-free issue and I'll definitely be back!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
I love this place!!!  Finally a pizza restaurant that has options for vegans. I come here whenever I can. Both the cheese-less pizza and the vegan cheese pizza's are awesome! :),yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria is one of the places I go to on a regular basis for a good pizza that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Why is pizza so expensive in Edmonton? Is it because cheese is expensive in Canada?  As far as pizzas, I have ordered the Margherita, Abruzzo, Vesuvio, Siciliana, and Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The pizza that I order the most often is the Abruzzo and the pizza that I found the most disappointing was the Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The time I ordered it, I found the flavor profile of the whole okay, but the execution was poor.  The duck was overly oily and the hoisin sauce overwhelming.  The one time that we ordered the Caprese Salad, the cheese texture was soggy and lacking flavor.  We found that this preparation of the salad was inedible.  The manager came to the table to explain the ""artisan"" cheese and how it is sometimes not created in a consistent quality.  He removed the salad from our bill and kindly offered us a complimentary dessert which we declined. We made sure to give a generous tip to staff since the service was great regardless of the salad.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I absolutely love going here. Visited the Jasper Ave location today with my Mom & sister after a spa morning. I find the service to be quick & friendly and the food so fresh and flavourful. I get in a rut and order the same thing everytime, but I enjoy it so much! Mmm...walnut gorgonzola salad!
It was the first time that Mom has tried it, and it's Mom approved!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Waited for our food for about an hour, had to flag down the waitress and ask her about it and she then informed me that they had lost our tables order. When it finally came the pizza was slightly burnt, a total rush job. I understand it's only one time and mistakes happen but it was an unfortunate mistake that made us sit there for an hour while our server never thought to ask the kitchen what was going on.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"After experiencing Famoso, no other Edmonton pizza joints are worthy!  We discovered Famoso when we moved to Edmonton last year, and it's now on our regular restaurant rotation.  

From the delicious crust which is baked in their stone oven in only 90 seconds to their obscenely flavourful tomato sauce, a Famoso pizza is like no other (outside of Italy, at least!).  We'll usually get the Vesuvio which includes spicy italian salami, fresh basil and cheese, and some chili pepper.  It's delicious with roasted mushrooms added as well.  Sometimes we'll also get a Funghi Tartufo pizza, because really, the pizza is so good that one is never enough!  The Fungji Tartufo includes white truffle oil, which is always a bonus in my books!

If we're with a group, or really hungry, we'll get the tapenade trio to start which includes olive tapenade, bruschetta and artichoke dip.  Bonus:  if you run out of pita bread, then you can use your pizza crusts to scoop up the leftover dips!

For dessert, the Dolce and Banana is superb.  It includes carmelized bananas, vanilla gelato and caramel sauce.  It's definitely more than enough for two people to share, and worth every calorie!

The gelato is fairly good at Famoso, but not outstanding.  I would rather take a little walk over to Cococo which is just down the street to get gelato, however.

Although the service is usually very quick, it can be very busy in this tiny Jasper Ave. location- so be prepared to wait if you're wanting to dine at dinnertime on the weekend!  They will take your cell phone number and give you a call when your table is ready, so you can head over to On The Rocks next door for a drink if you don't feel like standing.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"We were in tonight for a quick supper. Since I am celiac, we appreciate Famosa offering a gluten-friendly option. Our server was very helpful. We asked if the kitchen could pre-bake the crust, before baking it again with the toppings. The result was a very crispy, delicious pizza that even my spouse (who is not celiac) thought was just as good as the wheat crust. 

When paying our bill, there was a little confusion using our Groupon. The manager immediately came over to speak with us, and promptly resolved the issue.

Another reason to keep going back!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"My first time here was less than a week ago, and I was on a date with the boyfriend! This is a really great place, but boy is it busy! We were only 2 people so we only waited about 10 minutes or so for a table, but there were a lot of people waiting and there was an exorbitant amount of delicious smelling pizza! Yummmm. I really enjoy the concept of placing your own order and having them bring it to you. Our food was scrumptious and I had a delicious rose wine which was an absolutely perfect patio sipping wine. The gelato we had for dessert was delicious as well and I will definitely be heading back here in the near future, my only wish is that they would make the restaurant and patio bigger! We had great customer service, I had a gift card and it wasn't working but they still accepted it for the full amount which was absolutely wonderful, because that could have ruined my mood, but it definitely didn't! Great menu, great food, great service and wonderful date night, I was on cloud 9!!!!!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"The home of the 90 sec Neapolitan pizza! We were greeted by a friendly server, who took his time to explain to us how the pizza process works. The pizza came out exactly as shown on their website: my spouse thought that it was a bit too moist in the middle (so next time we order we will ask them to have hers in for another 10 sec). The food was excellent, service very prompt and the price quite reasonable. We will definitely come back again.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I would definitely recommend this place in the current age because it isn't usually busy and they've done a good job at keeping everything socially distance. I sat there on the patio today with a girlfriend and it was great - we were the only ones at like 5 pm, so it worked out! 

The service was great! We had the Quatro Formaggi pizza and some drinks. It was delicious. We were in and out fast. 

I will definitely be back. This location is great and food is great too!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"This is Famoso's flagship location, the first one they ever opened. It has LONG been my absolutely favourite pizza place in all of Edmonton. My mainstay is likely their margherita pizza but I also love the seasonal specials that change twice yearly.

The heated patio is very much appreciated during the shoulder season as this restaurant can get pretty loud and very busy in the evenings. The whole order at the counter but be served at your table thing is very European but works for this place splendidly. If I ever have room I'll have a dessert (the gelato is delicious!) but I usually focus on the salad and pizzetta deal (or sometimes the soup as well).

I'm not overly fond of their chai tea, but their Italian sodas are pretty great. And I can always count on their pizza to be delicious! I've recommended this chain and this location in specific to folks many a time and brought many folks here while they were visiting from out of town.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"If you're looking for a great pizza restaurant in Edmonton, look no further. Famoso has the best selection of wine and authentic Neapolitan pizza in the city. 

The environment inside the downtown location is nice and cozy, with tables or booths to accommodate you and your party of 4, or even if it's just for 2. The restaurant is small, medium to dim lighting, and they make use of every little space possible for tables. Do not let the small size fool you; the available patio essentially doubles the capacity and is great to sit in during the summer months.

Not familiar with pizza and wine combinations? Famoso makes it easy by splitting the menu into 2 sections: 'red' and 'white' pizzas, with the color allocated to the wine type. 'Red' is also an indication that it is primarily meat-based, whereas 'white' refers to chicken-based toppings. Of course, you do not need to order any wine...

The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable on menu items. Ordering involves a different procedure however. You are seat yourself at a table and take a menu from the table corner, and although a server comes to take your drink order, you have to take your main order to the ordering till. Although it's not really a hassle, it can be complicated if you have a large party and offer to take down everyone's order (Wait, am I doing the server's job?). Dishes are brought to your side of the table thankfully.

Here comes the important part: recommendations! Their Italian Sodas are bubbly and full of flavor, even though it's really San Pellegrino. The Mediterranean Flatbread is an excellent appetizer. The Flatbread is warm and soft when you get it, and the house-made tzatziki and Tuscan hummus dipping sauce is made to a high quality. I found it easier to just take a knife and spread both on the flat bread instead of poking at the dip with the soft bread...it's just more efficient. The Siciliana pizza and Bella pizza were baked just right with fresh ingredients...this is definitely not your take out-style pizza. Still hungry for dessert? I recommend their Nutella Pizza pizza. That's right, Nutella and banana combined in a warm pita-like enclosure. 

In a rush? Waiting time for the above dishes was under 15 minutes! Speedy, especially if you're on the run. On Wednesdays, they have their Vino night, which is a free wine tasting event. Also, if you purchase a bottle of wine, you get a free order of bruscetta. Not a deal breaker but it's a good alternative if you go down with a group and share the cost of a bottle! I will definitely be coming back again!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I love Famoso. The thin-crust, oven-baked pizza is addictive and delicious. The appetizers and salads are also great. I'm sure the dessert would have been good, too, but I didn't have any room left by then. 

Service is fast and efficient, although you do have to go up to the counter to order yourself.

The only downside to this place is that there is generally a long wait to get in and it is almost always crowded. Excellent for a date or dinner with a group of friends.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Went here last week to have supper with a friend and really liked the way the place was set up, with tables and chairs of differing heights. Service was very fast and friendly, and because it was Wednesday, there was some live jazz going on. Both of us enjoyed our pizzas, and there are some good vegan and gluten-free options. My pizza was exactly as I expected it, with plenty of toppings and the crust was perfectly done.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I have been making homemade pizza from scratch for many years now simply because I can't find store bought pizza that doesn't have an insanely thick crust or too much cheese or unbelievably unhealthy ingredients. I was SO excited to hear about Famoso as they were described to me as making ""real Italian pizza"". I was not disappointed on my first visit! 

The flour and tomatoes are imported from Italy for a truly Italian taste. I ordered a pizza loaded in hot meats and peppers and was thrilled when it came with thinly sliced meats, a reasonable amount of cheese and fresh veggies on top. I watched as the pizza was baked fresh in the oven. The taste was amazing! The crust was crunchy, yet somehow flavored with the juices from the other ingredients without being soggy. I couldn't get enough of the stuff and ordered another one to go for later that evening.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"We went her for lunch today for the first time. The food was good but the service really stood out. it seemed like the staff really enjoyed their work and every person who helped us was proud to work their, thats rare to see so management must be doing something right. An added bonus was that we chatted with the head chef and after telling him that we were going to go to Boston Pizza but instead decided to try something new he came back and gave us a discount on the bill. We were like wow Boston Pizza has never done that for us. We were not expecting that at all but it was nice of him to even take the time to ask us how our dining experience was. I highly recommend this place, it has a very nice family business feel :)",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I like this place because it's a great venue for meeting up with friends prior to other evening activities, be it at OTR or somewhere else. I find their pizzas consistent and I like ordering the smaller one with salad. Appies are pretty tasty too. Oh yeah, I'm a sucker for dessert, especially something like gelato. 

It's got a fun atmosphere and they've also got a covered patio that allows more seating options. Service can be a hit or miss here but there's usually a stronger server that notices the lack of the one attending to us and picks up that slack. Parking is easier to get earlier in the evening. The closer time for the bar crowd to appear, the higher the chance you'll need to park on the street or further away behind the building (which is paid parking) or a few streets over. The parking lot is shared with shoppers, the liquor store, OTR and the restaurant. So it can get crowded later in the evening. Be careful not to park along Jasper Ave between 117 st & 118 st after 9:30 pm as it changes to a can zone and several of my friends had tickets waiting for them shortly after 9:30 pm.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
Amazing!! The pizza here is unbelievable. We will be repeat customers for sure!! Staff was very nice and friendly. We went in the restaurant to order the food to take home. Cute little place!! Definatly 5+ stars!!!,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"As always, Famoso at WEM is a nice dinner respite from a long day and with good company too :-)

Went for the Wednesday evening and enjoyed a nice 4 formaggi pizza with the Gorgonzola Walnut Salad which they kindly substituted the Romaine lettuce for the Arugula :-)

For me, it is a ""go to"" no matter what ails me when I want to have ""una pizza"" ... the service is always good and courteous, and the food, happily (and yummily--if there could ever be such a word) consistently GOOD :-)",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"We just ate here last night and the service was awesome. The pizza crust definitely seemed homemade and the sauce tasted really fresh. The pizzas we had here were better than any pizzas we had in Naples. Really cool atmosphere too, but very small...maybe 10 tables. We went on a Thursday and got the last table available so I could imagine there's a wait on a Friday. I almost gave this place 4 stars because it is a bit expensive for the size of the portions that you get...but then we tasted the gelato and a 5-star rating was solidified (egg nog and chai tea flavours...so good).  Best gelato we've had outside of Florence.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Don't waste your time here. We went in because this place has good reviews, however I would beg to differ. The beer and appetizer was the best part of the meal. The waitress bragged about how the pizza is fast fired in 90 seconds, however it simply wasn't cooked. When we notified the waitress she said that Neapolitan pizza is doughier, and it is simply a preference if we don't like it so undercooked. I looked it up and Neapolitan pizza is defined by the sourdough used, and tomatoes grown on mount Vesuvius and cheese from a water buffalo. Nowhere is it noted that Neapolitan pizza is not fully cooked and served with raw dough. Although featuring a softer and molten centre, our pizza crust was doughy and raw. Also we ordered the pistachio pesto pasta and although there were some good flavours in there it was served cold. We mentioned this also, and since the chefs are on display and our table was near the cooking area, we had to overhear the waitress telling the cooks about our complaint.  The best part of the meal was the appetizer, which was a cauliflower artichoke dip. It was great, but the entrees were terrible. Maybe the waitress should have gotten the manager because she couldn't handle our complaints and we actually paid for this terrible food. I asked her if she had ever been to ""blaze pizza"" which also does a fast fire pizza and she had not. Well I won't be going back to Famoso again that's for sure. It was uncomfortable in the small environment as we waited forever for our bill to arrive. We noted that the pasta was advertised as imported from Naples, however it was served so quickly. We saw the chefs scooping out pre cooked past and reheating it in the oven. At the price point I expect made to order food. This was fast food. Why import your pasta if you are simply going to reheat it? Then serve us raw pizza? Disappointing. The bill wasn't worth me getting to write this scathing review.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"The place is nice & the workers are quite nice, but the downside is you have to go up and order what you want - usually its super busy & it takes forever to order something . i Know they're famous for their pizza's n what nots but i don't think they're that special. i think they're normal and they should priced a bit less. I went with a group of my friends (4)- all our first time, we asked how big the pizza was, and what size we should order. She recommended a medium pizza - thinking it was big we said okay & ordered it. it took an hour for it to come & we found out it was way too small for 4 people & had to order another. The second pizza took less time but she gave us the wrong order & we had to wait again. overall it was a bad experience .",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I was quite excited to try this place out, thinking that it would be very authentic and all, but was a tad disappointed that the pizzas were just about decent, at best.  I loved the variety that they exhibited, but I would probably rate Da Capo and Leva a star higher for their pizzas.

They've got an interesting list of salads that complement their long list of traditional and exotic ""new world"" pizzas pretty well.  A decent selection of Italian wines. Yes, it really did look like they had only Italian wines. 

The prices are very reasonable and the ambience casual.  It's certainly not an expensive dinner place.  I had the vesuvio pizza which was delizioso!! The spicy sausage (soppresatta) with basil went great.  Actually the signature thing about the vesuvio is that the crushed red peppers are added before the pie is thrown in the 900¬∫C oven (well, the server made it a point to show-off that they had a 900¬∫C oven!) . So yes, red peppers in before baking is something unique, I realize today.

Yummy, delicious pizzas ... not the best in town, when it comes to the authentic Napolitana pizzas, but I'd come here again!  Very affordable and enjoyable.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ

"If the Apocalypse rings my doorbell tomorrow, Famoso Downtown will be the last place I beg to dine. Casual pizza is an understating choice, right? Famoso and I have a longstanding love affair for three reasons: low gluten crust, fior di latte mozzarella, and a sweet seemingly caramelized tomato sauce!

The crust! I can't find this chewy, crispy, impossibly thin platform at any other pizzeria, and dang it, I'm an aficionado! Expect a line-up out the door from 6-7PM but this is a quick-dine establishment. The pizza cooks in 90 seconds in an imported fire oven. My mother and I were at the tail end of the line a weekend ago and still had seats in 15 minutes. Warm, busy, and buzzing with talk. Trendy-casual as you might expect.

The pizza menu isn't modest, including authentic red and white pizzas and a few ""new world"" favorites too. If you're not a pizza fiend you'll enjoy the salads with equally fresh toppings. Dessert lovers should try the nutella pizza or an affogato with a scoop from the rotating gelato menu. Keep an eye on the seasonal menu for truly unique pizza selections.

My modified favorite:
Primavera with a red sauce substitution and pepperoni added. $17.50/Feeds 2

What my friends order:
Sweet BBQ Chicken Pizza  14.5/Feeds 1-2
Spicy Thai Pizza 14.5/Feeds 1-2
Caprese Salad $12/Feeds 1

Don't Miss:
$16 Margherita Pizza & A Movie  (cineplex movie pass included) every Mon-Thurs",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso is a place I can visit in any occasion, lunch, supper, dinner, to catch up with friends, for a date or just to enjoy my book while I eat a tasty pasta or pizza.
This central location welcomes everyone, adults and kids, families and big groups; it is located right next to OTR so after you dinner you always can go next door to try some salsa o dance a bit.

The service is one of the most important reasons while i keep visiting them. They all are so nice and make you feel welcome. 

I have ordered pizzetas, soups, salads but last time I went It was a Tuesday, and on Tuesdays any pasta entree is $11, so why not, lets try one! So I ordered the Pistachio pesto primavera that is a linguine, with house made pistachio pesto cream sauce, roasted zucchini, green peas, roasted mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes - my favorite ingredient-, and grana padano usually this cost $15.75 so I think this is a pretty good deal ^^, and the pasta was really tasty.

So if you are in the neighborhood, feeling hungry or on your way to a night out, I recommend you to stop by Famoso and to enjoy one of their specialties.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Best Pizza in Town, great concept & good service. My wife & I have eaten @ 3 locations and have equally enjoyed them all, great family place too.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I love famoso. They have a simple philosophy and it's no surprise their franchise has expanded so quickly. 

The pizzas are probably one of my favorites in the city, especially the brussel sprout/prosciutto chip one. It's amazing. 

I can never decide whether I like having to go up and order or not but really it never takes too much time and it's not hard to do! 

My favorite location is the one down in terwillegar - least favorite is probably jasper. Food is great everywhere but I like the atmosphere better in the newer ones. I've never been a high tables fan. 

All in all I have never been disappointed. And they take care of their customers. Service is always great. 

Sad the wine club had to go. :(",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
Nothing fancy about this place. Some of the pizzas are good. Don't order their margarita pizza... it was very bland and only had 4 small leaves of basil on it.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Not bad! 

I've had better - both in Italy and in Alberta - traditional neopolitan-style pizzas, but these guys are affordable, the atmosphere is comfortable and friendly, and the food tastes pretty good.

Little sad they wouldnt put two different pizza toppings (especially as they had the same base) on one pie so I didn't have to choose between two, but that's fine. 

Inclined to think the crust should not be falling apart that much, and that the prosciutto should have been heated before adding it to the pizza, but those are personal preferences. 

Really want to go back and try out their goronzola, pinenut & pear pizza they have as a winter special - it looks amazing!!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I can't believe it's been so long since I last had Famoso, tooo long! We recently came here for Friday night dinner and I was reminded how delicious the pizza is here. I can never go back to delivery again.

The dough is delectably chewy, not tough or overworked. I personally love the red sauce pizzas as they seem to have more zing. We ordered the Siciliana with Italian sausages. A simple pizza that was the perfect balance of texture and flavour. Dessert was pineapple panna cotta, a mildly sweet pudding-like dessert with dried, chewy pineapple chunks and shredded coconut on the side. It was followed by an irresistable scoop of salted caramel gelato that was more sweet than salty. They will let you sample the various gelato flavors before choosing.

Famoso is now on our list of regular go-to's for those lazy nights!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I like Famoso because they're different from all the other pizza joints in the city. Their pizzas are made with thin and chewy dough, baked fresh in the oven. The selection is amazing, and you'll have a hard time choosing if it's your first time.

We ordered the Conforto pizza with Italian sausages, red peppers and mushrooms. Sooo good! Everything is fresh and melts in your mouth. You might want to eat this one fast though, cause the juices from the veggies soaks into the dough and makes it slightly mushy.

We also ordered the pizza with pruschuitto and arugula leaves for some variety. The pruschuitto was good, salty and chewy as it should be, but the arugula gave the pizza a strange, bitter taste. If you're not an arugula fan, you might want to skip this one.

It's good to order a couple of pizzas to share with friends, so you can taste more than one of their delicious pies. Plus, you're guaranteed more room in your tummy for dessert. The tiramisu is fabulous, especially with whipped cream and chocolate sauce!

The place itself was cozy and welcoming. You seat yourself and order at the till when you know what you want. They'll ask you for your table number and bring it over to you. The staff were nice and friendly, and let us stay til closing without saying a word. I'm definitely coming here again!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"It was always great service by really cool people. Pizza is like the one I had in Trieste, Italy. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes good pizza.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
My favorite pizza! I could eat it every day! So fresh and light. Staff are amazing at this location and the atmosphere is always cozy.  There's a nice little patio that's comfortable and warm. Don't leave without trying the bisque  and dessert,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ

"So I've been to Famoso a few times now. Being from Toronto orginally I never knew about this franchise until I came to Edmonton. My experiences here have been up and down; never terrible but never overly amazing. Yesterday afternoon I had a completely different experience as I met my brother and his family here who were visiting from Ontario. It started with myself showing just as they opened and being greeted by a friendly gentlemen as I asked for space for 6. As one can imagine, there was no one there at opening so we pretty much had the place to ourselves as we began our reunion. The servers were exceptional in checking in with us over the course of our two hours at the restaurant. I had to wait a bit for my brother and his family but the same gentlemen who greeted at the onset of our stay came over a few times to make sure we were comfortable. He started us with water and offered us coffees as we waited but, at the same time, was not obnoxious in his service. Once my family arrived our waitress was exceptional in checking up on us; in the midst of catching up we overlooked what we wanted but she wasn't rushing us or impatient whatsoever. Due to the size of our party we were offered the biggest space they had and the service was on point in the sense that when we needed our server she was there and when we didn't she was nowhere to be found. If I had caught her name she would definitely get a shout out.  I gave Famoso a 4 because like I said before I've never had a great experience but never a bad one either. I've been ignored in favour of more recent guests before so I was pleasantly surprised at the service for our visit yesterday. I've become accustomed to the food so you could say this review is more about the experience than anything. We all did enjoy our food and my brother in particular was surprised at the quality of his soup and salad combo. I live near here so I suppose I visit more than anyone should but nonetheless I applaud the staff for making my most recent, and my family's first experience, a pleasant and memorable one.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Ate here last weekend with my family. As suggested by others, it seems like a good family place to eat - high chairs, accommodating staff, etc. The pizza was great, as always. We've eaten at a Famoso in Victoria and the consistency seems to be pretty good across locations. We ordered two pizzas for our family (2A and 2 kids under 6) and that was a fair amount for all. The kids loved their pizza, and they can be a bit fussy when it comes to pizza. We also loved our pizza - the crust was thin(er) and chewy and the toppings (mushrooms, olives) were fresh and tasty. We ordered a large salad to share between the two adults. It was a caprese-style salad however, both my wife and I agreed that it was not good value (small, expensive). Finally, we finished the meal with some desserts. The adults had affogado (coffee and ice cream, in this case salted caramel). It was delicious, perhaps one of the best we've had! May go back just for this! ;)

Overall, Famoso was a good experience, and we'll go back. Gave it 4/5 because of the salad issue, but perhaps with more visits, we'll find the right things to order! :)",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Oh my goodness and the goodness is the menu, staff and atmosphere.  Love this place, just sad my bests sold his nearby condo across Jasper Ave from here.  Will still visit of course cause the whole visit is worth the trek always.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso is a solid place to meet up with a friend or many friends.  They have wonderful thin crust pizza or pizzettas (think smaller) with a wonderful variety of topping options that fail to meet your tiring regulars.  That being said you can still get your all meat, or hawaiian, they just may be a little more adventuresome that the regular 'order it to the front door' variety.  

I was there because a colleague won a business card draw from the last time we visited.  7 of us were treated to free appies, meals, desserts and non-alcoholic bevies.  Wonderful service, wonderful food and if you go you MUST MUST MUST try the Nutella Mocha.  Did I mention you MUST MUST MUST try the Nutella Mocha?  

Enjoy this little slice of Italy! (Did you see what I did there? ""Slice"" and it's a pizza place! Yeah I know, I'm killing these reviews this morning!)",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Back again last night. Yes, its a fave, and yes I eat out this often!

Food and service was great! The restaurant was BUSY with tons of people waiting for tables. Went with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and we just wanted to catch up. We were in no way rushed by staff to turn over the table.

I had the usual (Walnut Gorgonzola Salad & Sweet BBQ Chicken Pizza) and my friend tried something new (Napoli Salad & Conforto Pizza). For dessert, I the Blueberry Gelato, and her the Tiramisu. Both of us left happy and full. Prices are right too!!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"One of the first things I did after I moved to Edmonton from Montreal was to look up the best Pizza places Edmonton has to offer. Famoso was highly referred by the Yelp community as well as a most of my friends. And boy I wasn't disappointed even though I had high expectations. 

It was love at first sight. Or might I say Love at first bite. I absolutely fell in love with their thin crust Pizza. Every bite was a delicious explosion inside my mouth. Fresh, juicy, flavorful and everything a Pizza should be like. One trip to Famoso and you will never feel like going back to delivery again (well unless in times of desperate need in middle of night). I also tried their Tiramisu for desert but I would say I have had better. (But who cares, I just care for their amazing Pizzas).

Their service is really good and they do care about accommodating customers in best way possible. However I have heard about long line ups on holidays and weekends. Definitely worth the wait.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I came to Famoso's original location on Jasper Avenue last night for the first time with a group of 5 girlfriends and my mother.  I was so excited to bring them here as I have had such wonderful experiences at the St. Albert Trail Famoso location and three of them had never eaten at a Famoso before.

Unfortunately, our experience was anything but pleasurable.

We arrived around 830pm and sat in the outdoor patio section.  The glass window that was against our table to the street had been broken - all the other panes were in tact... I began to wonder...

Our server came and explained the Famoso process and we soon went to the front to order.

Approximately 10 minutes later our appetizers arrived.

I ordered the TAPENADE TRIO $9
Kalamata olive tapenade, roasted artichoke tapenade, bruschetta. Served with flatbread.

While the 3 tapinades tasted fresh - the miniature and I mean miniature flat bread that came with it wasn't enough for even half the toppings nor were they cut big enough to even hold one piece of the chunky bruschetta.  Upon us finishing the miniature bread - I requested more and another super small basket of miniature bread arrived about 5 minutes later.

At about the same time everyone's entrees in our party arrived - except 3 of the 6 entrees were incorrect.  Soup when there should have been salad - onions on my pizza when I requested no onions.

Okay... 5 minutes later everyone's food is back except mine.  I was told it would be just another minute or so.

10 minutes later... still no food.  

We had to flag down our server to inquire what was going on and request refills of pop and water even though we had already been here for an hour at this point.

Another 5 minutes later... my entire party of 6 has finished their entire meals and I'm still waiting on my pizza sans onions even though it only takes 90 seconds to cook the pizza in their 900 degree farenheit oven which the server had proudly explained to us.

The manager came over and apologized and said my pizza was being cut up and would be here in a minute.

5 minutes later... my pizza arrives - part of the curst burned black... Okay, whatever.  I take my first bite and the middle of the pizza isn't cooked - it's doughy/raw in the middle!

I had ordered the SAN ANDREAS Pizzetta described as:
Extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and oregano base, fresh mozzarella and chili-lime marinated roasted chicken. Baked, topped with avocado, diced tomatoes, slivered red onion, cliantro, drizzled with light cream, lime wedge.

I have had this pizza previously at a different location and LOVED it... however, this time was not love at first bite!

The server comes to ask how my pizza is and I tell her but add that I don't want to wait for another one to be cooked as my entire party has already finished their meal.

I nibble at my pizza but couldn't bring myself to finish the raw and burnt dough.

A few minutes later the manager comes by, apologizes and says they will be taking care of my portion of the bill.   I thank the manager - everyone pays their bill - and we are on our way.

So disappointing!  And I had been so excited to introduce 2 of my girlfriends and my mother to Famoso's for the first time.  

Unfortunately this will be our last visit to this location - I haven't given up all together.  But next time we'll stick to the newer location on 137 avenue and St. Albert Trail where it's clean, bright, airy, and modern!

Sorry Famoso's... Don't know if this was just bad luck or ???  But it's enough that I won't be returning to this location.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"A chain that is actually good!

A new take on pizza, or I guess a more traditional take on pizza is a better way to describe it. One thing that takes this pizza place above and beyond is that every ingredient they even use  on their pizza is delicious by itself. I could deconstructed this pizza layer by layer but  I think it would be more fun (and delicious) for you to go there and try it yourself.

While your there get yourself an Italian greyhound, a delicious cocktail.  and try some Gelato. 

This location is a smaller location but its one of my favourites the service there is great and its easy to get to. they have an cover and heated patio.  They also take reservations and are super friendly.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Did you know Famoso does vegan pizzas?  They do!  And that's why I love Famoso.  As someone who eats a mostly vegan diet it was great to find another restaurant that offers vegan options.  And the fact it's pizza is even better (so sick of the standard 'vegan chili' at restaurants)!  Oh, and they don't even charge extra for the Daiya 'cheese'.

I've visited this restaurant pretty consistently for the past few years and always enjoy the food.  High quality food with fresh ingredients for a reasonable price.  There's no waiting for a waiter/ess as you go to the counter to order your own dishes.  Service otherwise is prompt and friendly.

Don't forget to try their gelato!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I've always been a fan of Famoso, even though Al isn't. I usually go when I'm out at lunch or another time so I can have their yummy pizza and some of the truly delish gelato. 

I love their Cavoletti pizza (with roasted brussels sprouts, prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese, dates, and honey over walnuts). SO unusual and SO FREAKING good. And the mint straciatella gelato is my favorite. 

Extra special callout for Pablo at this location who was SO understanding when I was having problems with my cards yesterday. He has earned my business for life. :)",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"We've only been here once.  I think we'll come back again :) the drinks were made just right and the pizza was great! I want to try a few other pizzas too!  The staff was very nice. They were short staffed and we had to wait a little extra (they let us know), but meh that shit happens. The atmosphere in the kitchen and their relationship to the servers was really pleasant too.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Very disappointed in the vegan pizza. They basically put no vegan cheeze on it - it didn't even cover the pizza or the toppings or anything, but was like a few sparse sprinkles here in there. It looked as if they had come across the last bit in the bag and just tried to spread it out to make it cover one pizza when it really couldn't even cover a quarter of it.

We won't be back again. We found out Panago Pizza has vegan options that are much better and actually give you lots of Daiya cheeze on your pizza - like a real pizza should!

Revamp your vegan pizzas and we'll consider coming back. But you've got a lot of competition with Panago, especially considering all of their healthy, delicious vegan pizza options.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"What a wonderful place to eat. I've personally experienced Famoso only a few times and with the compliments of my friends I know it's not just my experience but everyone agrees - Fomoso is a MUST try!

The food is simply delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and every bite is so incredibly flavorful. A unique pleasure in dining at Famoso is the flavors are all very unique. I feel it's a great place to dine if you're sick of ""the same-old"".

I find Famoso is a really great place for a date! The way you order is unique - not like your standard restaurant. It allows you to focus on your date and not on the waiter/waitress who isn't coming around when he/she should. Personally, I like it but some may disagree. Let me know how your date goes and tell me if you liked it. ;)

Look, I don't want to get in the habit of just rating all my favorite restaurants 5/5 stars, but this one seriously deserves it. There is not one aspect I can think of where I could conceivably dock them a point - they truly impressed me in every way. Not only have they provided me with an amazing experience but those who I've recommended the restaurant to have also been profoundly impressed. I appreciate it when I recommend a restaurant and they don't make me look like an idiot. That's the kind of restaurant I want to give 5 stars to - the kind that continues to deliver on a 110% level no matter who visits!

Keep up the good work Famoso! You'll be seeing me and my friends again soon!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Went here for a fast and informal business lunch. Although I still don't quite understand why orders are not taken at the table, the small pizza and Caesar salad combo I had was terrific. Wait staff was attentive with drink refills and such but not inteusive. Just might go back next time I am in town.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"This is not your typical  pepperoni or hawaiian pizza joint.  I'm told this is Italian-style pizza: soft thin crust, a few simple ingredients, quick cooked in a fire oven at high heat. I don't know if this is authentic, but I do know that it is good.  Very good.  I like pizza that isn't drowning in cheap cheese and economy meats.  They use high quality ingredients and don't smother the pie with cheese, so you can enjoy the taste of each element.

We try to alternate between the rosa and the bianca styles, these have tomato  sauce or olive oil-garlic-oregano base.  I love the vegetarian options, but have also enjoyed the arugula-proscuitto as well as the spicy sopressata.

The summer features are good.  Their version of mohito is basil and limoncello, despite not generally a being fan of limoncello, I am a huge fan of this drink and now order it every time whether we eat in, or to enjoy while we wait a very short time for takeout.

They also have several gelato flavours, which look tempting, but I haven't tried ... yet.

The order system is a bit different, you order deli style at the counter and then they bring it to your table. Staff are quick and pleasant.  It gets crowded at times, and you'll know why after your first bite.

Before Famoso, pizza had lost it's allure for me, now these circles of pleasure are back on my list.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Great selection of well made pizza, very reasonable prices and amazing desserts. We went in as a group of 20 and there was a ""Group"" selection for $258 - 12 pizzas and 8 appetisers! Amazing deal. There is no ""unknown"" extra charges and it could be any pizza on the menu.

My favourites were the smoked salmon, capers and a white sauce pizza followed by a Thai Chicken pizza then the banana nutella calzone!! Great bellini in a bottle as well~

who knew Edmonton had such a gem!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Honestly I haven't been to any other location other than this one. As I believe this is the original location and start to this great pizza place. Over the years there have been lots of changes. Now you get full service at your table which is a change I welcome. I always found it weird to order everything up front and then you get service. We came the other night after a long time having not been. I noticed the menu is a lot smaller than it use to be. While still I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order, some of my favorite pizzas ( particularly the one with roasted salmon and dill) were no longer on the menu. I've never had a pizza here I didn't like. The servers are always friendly and though it gets crazy busy I rarely feel forgotten. The patio is great in the summers and there is lots of free parking.
The one thing that has changed is they switched companies that make the gelato. I was coming here very often just to get my gelato fix and I've found the new stuff just isn't as good as the old. As a result I don't go just for gelato anymore but it's still good as a dessert after a meal.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"We have 6 ppl this time. Shared two pizzas, one salad and one pasta, which is pretty much enough for us.

We got the martini seasonal pizza and it was great! Definitely go with the white sauce pizza. To me, white sauce tastes better than red sauce.

We tried the blueberry and Greek salad too! It's amazing and the portion is pretty big too! Good for sharing among 4 or more people.

Servers are nice and food comes pretty quickly! Good place for hanging out.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
Service is great. Everyone is very nice and serviceable. They will offer you the things before you ask for them; that's awesome. The pizza isn't the best ever but it's pretty good. Definitely good value for money as everything seems really fresh.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"So I must just be getting old but I have been hard pressed to find a pizzeria lately who's pizza does not make me feel like crap half an hour after eating a grease soaked slice. This place is soooo different! I personally like the location as I enjoy walking around downtown and around the Jasper Ave area when I find myself feeling a little restless. 

Atmosphere - Kind of has a neighbourhood pub type feel to it - little darker decor, nice patio. We went at kind of an off time so it was not very busy at all but I can see it getting pretty crazy at peak times for sure - smaller 'lobby'/waiting area! You sit down, check out the menu, order what you want at the counter, and you are served at your table from then on. 

Food - AMAZING!! Everything tasted really fresh - you could actually distinguish the tomato flavor in the sauce! Not at all greasy but also very different from any pizza I had ever had locally before (reminded me of pizza I had when I was in Italy a few years back - so I thought it was very authentic).  Did take a little getting used to just because it's really not what you expect to get when you order a pizza.  Weird pink juice/pop was awesome and I HATE carbonated drinks - but not too sugary. Caramelized banana dessert was actually OK given I don't like bananas at all (guy I was with ordered it despite knowing my strong feelings against bananas - needless to say we don't see each other anymore...anyway...). Best part - not feeling like crap half an hour later!! 

Only been once but I will go back for sure! One just popped up in Sherwood Park (my stomping grounds) so I may be finding myself there a little more often! Looks like it might make a really good girls evening out spot for those nights when trying to avoid the super irritating, personal bubble popping, lame pickup line sputtering, way too sloshed men you find at most other bars/pubs.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
We wanted to check this place out after reading the great reviews. The kids wanted their standard pepperoni which looked great. We tried the Korean BBQ and it was amazing on a pizza. We also had a veggie version for one of us and it looked and tasted great as well.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"How the place works is you seat yourself, order at the counter and it is full service after that.  Service was friendly and the food came very fast (good because we were already cutting it close to getting to the Taylor Swift concert).  The pizza was good, but nothing special.  I have been fortunate enough to eat some fantastic pizza in my life, and this was just not on par with those.  The Primavera Pizza with red sauce was good, just not memorable.  The crust was fine, thin like I like.  The tips of the pizza came soggy though.  The rasberry Italian soda I had was decent.  I liked this place, but I don't think I would return.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I love the pizza here, but my granddaughter goes nuts for it! Plus the staff are the absolute best. They let her help with putting the toppings on and they go out of their way, when it's not busy, to really make sure she has her best day ever...which is what she says every time we go to Famosa. Great place!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"We were looking for good spaghetti and meatballs... as requested by the two year old... so we ventured to Famoso's downtown location. 
We were all starving so went straight to the main courses. Our party ordered meatballs, Mac n cheese, vesuvio pizza (spicy Italian sausage) and ham with crushed pineapple pizza too. 
The meatballs were pretty good but the Mac n cheese was made with a beer cheese sauce and prosciutto crisps, it was fantastic.
The pizzas were both excellent and it's fun to watch the chef tossing the pizzas and bringing freshly cooked pizzas out of the pizza oven. 
They have a nice wine selection and quite a few craft and local beers available. 
The kids menu is small you get a free gelato for kids too! Our server was lovely but she made a mistake and brought a full size portion instead of a kids one, we were not charged for the large and now have lunch for tomorrow! 
They have booster seats available, change tables and gender neutral bathrooms.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
This place is getting a 100/100 stars from me. Me and my coworker came here today on a not so nice snowy day for some lunch. We had the unfortunate experience of having two people in the parking attack my friends vehicle with knifes. While the whole situation was playing out the served us our drinks and brought out our delicious hot home cooked food. The staff were incredibly nice and made us feel safe and also compensated our meal (which they didn't have to!). Will always be a loyal client to Famoso.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"My favourite pizza in Edmonton! It's authentic Italian pizza! If you're a greasy, tons of cheese, heavy crust kind of person...you probably won't like Famoso. The pizza is so light, I can eat an entire pie myself!

I have yet to dislike anything I've tried on their menu. The tomato bisque is amazing, and my favourite pizzas are the San Andreas, Prosciutto Aruglua, Cappricciosa, Vesuvio and Conforto. I'm really looking forward to trying their new Funghi Tartufo! The Dolce & Banana dessert is to die for!

The downtown location, in my opinion, is the best one. It's the original, but it is quite busy...so get there early to grab a seat. There's also a table in the back that is for reservations of 6 or more people. The service here has always been top notch, and I've never left unhappy or hungry.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso is one of my favourite restaurants in the city... but it's way too busy. I've never gone here and not had to wait 20 minutes for a table. The restaurant is fairly small, and the lobby is even more cramped, making waiting -- whilst breathing in the delicious aroma of gourmet pizza -- an agonizing experience. Thankfully, there's often wine samples to be had to ease your impatience. I've fallen so much in love with certain dishes, I rarely venture to try what they have new. The prosciutto mozzarella balls are better than sex, and I have no idea what else the restaurant serves as appetizers since I only ever get those. When it comes to the main dish, I'm a little more adventurous. Recently I had a delicious white pizza with pear on it. I ate the entire thing, much to my date's dismay (ladies, if you want to eat like a bird in order to avoid scaring off your male company, I suggest eating before visiting Famoso, because only an over-stuffed stomach will keep you from consuming everything in sight at this restaurant). Wednesdays are some sort of ""wine club"" night, which means we got plates of bruschetta with our wine. The only real damper to your evening is the guilt you experience enjoying yourself, while rabidly hungry customers  wait at the door for you to give up your seat. I had to wait 20 minutes, you do too! Settle down! Famoso, please buy the entire block and create the largest restaurant in Edmonton and I will visit every night. And I will also then give you 5 stars.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"They are alright. Been here a few times, firstly for the love of thin crust pizza, then with friends. I know of a more classic pizza place than this that is my go-to and cheaper too. Still good.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Went had a fire roasted tomato bisque soup/ salad served with flat bread. The flat bread was great lots of garlic yum the salad was fresh and soap a little  in the spicy side then usual.

This location is older then other locations. I think it needs a Reno the the seats in booth look really worn out. 

They clean the tables well but leave the food on the seats. The booth sitting area very dirty and had lots of food crumbs on it. :(((

Lots of parking available.  
Price reasonable

Service was ok not the greatest. 

Overall I like the south common location the best.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Food was phenomenal, wait staff great. Tiramisu to die for. Will visit again, likely repeatedly.

Was blown away by the value, dinner for two came out to 26.50 with sharing one of the pricier pizza's; and a slice of tiramisu- plus a latte and an americano.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Honestly, if you can't handle a make-your-own pizza, don't offer it on your menu. Or, at the very least, don't charge so much for it if it is going to be consistently wrong. 

I have always enjoyed the pizzas at Famoso, but 3 of the last 4 times I have ordered, I have attempted to make my own. However, either the kitchen or the server decided to interpret my order loosely. The first time it was missing two ingredients, the second, roasted red peppers were substituted for pepperoni. But my latest order via Skip the Dishes was the real pi√®ce de r√©sistance: of two make-your-own pizzas, several ingredients seemingly randomly switched to the other pizza, rendering one bland and the other unpalatable. It would have been funny if it weren't for the $50 price tag. 

Famoso, I love your pizzas, but either ditch or fix the make-your-own option, or rename it The Randomizer.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"great pizza.. the dough its amazing light and crisp , and they use top ingredients for topping their amazing pizzas I personally love the prosciutto and arugula one its awesome the two flavor complement each other perfectly... nice!
their tomato sauce its perfect nice strong tomato taste low acidity very good and fresh , they put not much cheese but its perfect that way (and im a big cheese lover but they dont need to over do it cz really its great the way it is).

they also have a good variety of home made gelato in nice and exotic flavors..

their sandwiches are also very very good, i love this place and im glad they open a new location close to st albert :)",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso has always been a good spot to have a casual dinner and a bottle of wine.  The Jasper Ave location is our typically stop.  The service has always been ok, especially since it's somewhat of a cafeteria style.  However; last Thursday night I was impressed by how attentive the staff was during the waiting for a table to ensuring we had everything we required throughout the entire time we were there. Plus the timing of the food being delivered between appy's & main was right on.
Thanks Nate and to your staff for such an enjoyable experience.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I don't really see what the big deal is. 

Pizza dough tasteless. Soup a bit oily. Cheese is pretty good. I ordered the lunch menu with wine. $10+7. Likely will not come back.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I went for my second time yesterday...and it was just as amazing as the first!!  The flat bread is to die for!  They definitely know what they are doing!
I have had the mozza balls (I don't remember the actual name of the appy), they were wrapped in prosciutto...it was a tad bit salty...but over all very yummy.  I have also tried the salmon dill with capers and spicy thai chicken pizzas...both which were amazing!  I definitely could finish off a pizza on my own because the flatbread is so light and airy with amazing fire cooked taste.  Oh yes...I almost forgot, they have amazing desserts...flat bread with nutella, fresh bananas, and whipped cream....really who could pass that up!!!  
The atmosphere is very laid back, with customers going to the side to get their own plates, napkins, cutlery, going up to the counter to order your food and get your own drinks/refills.  
They have a patio, which I look forward to trying out in summer.  On the Rocks is next door, so it is the perfect location to go out for amazing pizza and then working it off on the dance floor! Haha!
I am sure this place is almost as good at the authentic pizzas in Italy...though I can not compare honestly.  I would recommend to try it out...I am sure it will be hard to go back to Boston pizza or Pizza 73 etc.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Went there on a Friday evening around 8, a busy time so I was expecting a bit of a wait. Get there and they have about 4 empty tables that I can see and a sign that says seat yourself. We seat ourselves and are then approached by a waitress who says that it isn't open seating. I guess they were doing call backs for people who were waiting. Said the wait would be 20 minutes. 

I didn't feel like waiting after that so we left. 

I think they need to make up their mind on taking reservations or not and how you order there because the process is downright stupid at the moment.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Can't get enough of this place. We've been here (or ordered from here) enough times that I've had some hits and some misses but the hits are enough to keep us coming back. My favorite is the white pizza add soppresata. I've had the triple pepperoni and it was just ok, 52 slices of pepperoni feels like a lot but it didn't actually look like a lot and I thought the sauce was a bit thin. The mozzarella meatballs appetizer is delicious, and I also recommend the garlic bread. When you order online delivery is FAST.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Obviously, the pizza, the staff, and the gelato are all, how do you say? Perfecto! Pizza is a favourite food of mine, and the flatbread style at Famoso is cooked in their magical super hot oven to perfection. I basically love every single item on the menu here.

This is the smaller-ish of the restaurants in this Edmonton pizza parlour group, but it makes for an intimate, date-like setting. One gelato, two spoons, please!

And to top it all off, this cheese-and-sauce-aganza is conveniently located right along the heart of the city, our own Jasper Avenue.

Why not 5 stars? I popped in late one summer evening recently and strolled in excitedly, thinking they were still going, because the front door was wide open. Sadly, nay. Why keep the door open when you've closed of the night? Trickery!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Somewhat overrated, but still worth the money overall. The ordering process is a little odd and the atmosphere leaves something to be desired, but still worth checking out if you're tired of the usual pizza chains.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Glad I came before noon to snag a booth as the other 3 were taken within minutes.  The seating include booths and stools and high tables.  It gets busy at lunch but I noticed the food was coming out quick.  The booth from us was occupied twice during our stay.  There's also a larger book at the back to accommodate larger groups.  While waiting for my friend, I ordered a tea.  They don't have tea pots for the hot water but our server was great at checking if we needed our mugs refilled.

They have changed the ordered to be service at the table now which is a nice change.  The lunch specials are great for $11.50, with a choice of salad or soup, and individual pizza.  I decided on the Napoli salad with greens, cherry tomatoes, chick peas, carrots, and balsamic vinaigrette.  The half size is $7 or full size for $11 and I ordered the larger one.  

The food came out quickly and the salad was a great choice.  The vinaigrette coated the greens but was not too overpowering in tastes and didn't make the greens soggy.  There were lots of chick peas and juicy tomatoes.  My friend always gets the gluten and dairy free pizza and he enjoyed it again.

The servers were great to check on us throughout but also let us enjoy our chat after our meal.  We were there for over 2 hours and there were a few tables occupied when we left.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I love the pizza, the staff is spot on for the concept, and it's cozy.  Only problem of course is that seating is limited, but that's because it's always so busy because it's awesome!  When I lived in Edmonton I went here lots, and not only is the pizza good, but the beverage selection, the gelato, and the salads are great too.

I really hope that they open one in Vancouver soon so I don't have to travel to Alberta just to have their pizza.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"This place has gone so downhill, it's insane. 

You no longer order at the front (servers come to your table), but there's no signs or anything indicating the change. I saw one older lady (who had clearly been before) try to go up front to order and was condescendingly told to go sit down and she would be helped.

I kept seeing one server touch the pizza's sitting on the landing tray, kind of grabbing the side of the crust and looking underneath? I couldn't figure out why - but EW. I get that the kitchen staff probably wash their hands enough, etc. But servers handle money, etc. She, in particular, kept touching her hair. DO NOT TOUCH THE FOOD.

Our server was the most inattentive I've come across (at any restaurant) in quite awhile. We waited at least 5 min before even being helped. Once we ordered, we waited ~20 min to get the pizza (I recall it used to be much quicker?). They were a bit busy - but nobody stopped by and apologized or said anything. The real kicker, though, came when we were done eating. We looked obviously done - utensils done and napkins on the table. But it took 20-30 freakin' minutes (at least 20, but I didn't start watching the clock until a bit into the wait) for our server to come back with our bill. (and that was only after prompting from us) He was decently busy, but he walked past our table numerous times and never said a thing - no 'ill be right back', nothing. We were literally just ignored (eventually my friend flagged down the food-touching other server to ask for some boxes and that finally started the bill process). There were only 2 servers, but there were at least 6 people fooling around in the kitchen, one girl who appeared to do nothing but pour water, and another guy who did nothing but chat with a customer over the gelato station.

Ultimately, the service was (in my opinion) inexcusably bad. Especially since there were no apologies for it. This is actually the first time in at least a couple years that I've left NO tip (I always try to leave enough they can tip out the kitchen) - because there just wasn't service to tip on. 

Though the food was edible, the pizza wasn't even good enough to get them a second star this time around. Slightly burnt crust, minimal cheese. Also, the water was warm.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
This place has a great location right off of Whyte Ave and the pizza is delicious. The four cheese pizza is great. I usually order it with tomato sauce instead of white sauce and add pepperoni. So nice to them cook it in 90 seconds as well. Comes out perfect. The dessert is great as well. The gelato with espresso is my favorite. Love this place.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
Super rude and pretentious.  Their gelato is freezer burned and take out is a hassle because they want to do everything on their time.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Was a bit disappointed in tonight's service. More care was given to take out than in dine in customers, cook staff rolled eyes at certain orders, and sweeping while people are eating isn't really a good practice... especially in these times. I know these are different times, but still.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Odd that I haven't written about Famoso before now.  I love this place.  I always go to this location.  The staff are amazing here.  The manager is very knowledge about wines and will recommend a great glass or bottle.  The wine list is obviously a passion here.  I've never had a bad glass, and am usually surprised at how amazing the wine is.  Some of my favorite wines I had first at this Famoso.  Become a member of the wine club.  Every now and again you'll get a big discount on a bottle.  Oh and the pizza is great too!  Try the Primavera, but with red sauce, and the quattro formaggio with white.  That and a big glass of wine will make your evening.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Famoso has become our ""go-to"" place when we are looking for dinner out.
The pizza is really the best around.  I also love the tomato soup and the sophia loren (veggie) sandwich.
However, as good as the food is, the staff is even better!  Always friendly and attentive.  The last time we went, our order somehow got missed in the system and we were left waiting for our food for over half an hour.  But once they were made aware of it, there were several people around making sure that we got our food and that it was correct.  We even offered dessert and the entire meal was comped!
This is one establishment that truly works to make sure that every customer leaves happy.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Always the best quality and service at this location. I ordered pick up and got there late. They remade the pizza because it was cold, even though i had no problem taking the cold one! The staff are always friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clean. And the pizza is always incredible. They also have a great wine selection. This is a great affordable place to have a nice dinner either romantic or with friends and family.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Stopped here for lunch yesterday. I had the Sophia Loren sandwich and caesar salad combo. My waitress, Michelle, was absolutely delightful and speedy. It wasn't overly crowded, so it was quiet and peaceful too.

I had a fantastic experience and will definitely be coming back.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I enjoyed their prosciutto and arugula pizza.  The roasted tomato bisque topped with feta and basil was pleasant as well.  What does need some serious attention, however, are the tomatoes used in the Caprese salad.  As tomatoes are meant to shine in such a salad, they should use truly flavourful tomatoes and not the same flavourless Sysco abominations that end up in inexpensive salad bars and sandwich shops across town.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"The pizza was disgusting.
Wet, not cooked and tasteless",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"In Italian cooking, it is very important to use the best and the freshest ingredients possible because the food is rather simple. Italian style pizzas call for the best dough, cheese and tomatoes. The owners of Famoso have mastered this aspect of preparing their pizzas. Both flour for the dough and tomatoes are imported from Italy. The cheese is a freshly made mozarella. This is what Famoso is all about - fresh ingredients that result in amazingly tasting pizzas.
My friends and I came in one late afternoon, and the place was packed and it was very noisy. We had to wait to be seated but it was no problem since we desperately wanted to try Famoso's famous thin crust pizza. We ordered two: one Prosciutto Arugula and  one Comforto. You have to pay for your order in advance, before you are seated and then wait for the waiter to bring your order. A little unusual but not inconvenient. When our pizzas came, we dug right in. The crust was thin and chewy; the ingredients combination tasted great. We could really taste the italian sausage and prosciutto, the olive oil and fresh herbs. Very yummy and fresh. Naples pizza in all its glory!
The owners of Famoso hit the nail on the head by opening their unique pizzeria in Edmonton. There are no pizza places like this in our little town.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"This location is perfectly situated a couple blocks away from where I live which is good 
(and sometimes dangerous) I love that Famoso gives you the option to create your own pizza and experiment, my favorite being a pizzetta with bianca sauce, arugula, avocado, garlic and brussel sprouts.  The staff at this location have always been lovely, especially our last waiter who is usually behind the counter in the kitchen but was trying his hand out at serving and did a great job. Food is always quick & consistent. Yay famoso.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"DO get here before suppertime if you can, beat the rush, lineups and crowd.

DON'T forget to order at the front, they'll bring the food and drinks to you.

There is a late night window for the bar crowd, and those insatiable midnight cravings.  It is best eaten fresh and hot out of the oven.

Our last visit here, we came right after work, and the Kitchen supervisor/head daytime chef was on. She was THE entertainment! 

I am a fan of the lunch special if you get here before 4pm -  pizzetta and soup or salad. It's a nice size meal. 

This last visit we did redeem a groupon for an appetizer & two pizzas.  I ordered a bottle of wine.  Service didn't reflect that we were using a promotion - it was very good. Sometimes we have to flag someone down to refill water, but sitting at the booths, we are in main traffic, and can usually flag down someone if needed.

We had two halves of pizza left, (of course - goodness for another meal!) and I convinced my other half to share some caramel salted dulche de leche gelato (From Fiasco Gelato in Calgary) with me...he said he was full. My mistake.  I wasn't paying attention, and he somehow made it vanish before I knew it!

Food is usually prompt, service friendly, and if you want to taste a wine before ordering an entire bottle, they can oblige.

Don't hesitate to add extra toppings - I'm a double-basil fan. Margarita pizza is my first love.  If a joint can't make that well, I'm not sure I'm going to love the rest of their offerings.

NEWS: they have introduced a Gluten Smart pizza crust. While i have not tried it yet, (I forgot oopsie!), I have had little issue with the 00 (double-zero) low gluten imported flour as long as I pay attention to the toppings as some ingredients don't agree with me.

Promotions:

They also offer Pizza and a Movie. Add $6 to the price of any pizza on Tuesdays and get a Cineplex movie ticket (2 year expiry) or add $8 any other day of the week.  We definitely take advantage of this offer - it's a GREAT deal.

Vino Wednesdays enjoy $15 off any reserve bottle of wine all day long.

Famoso Feast - Reserve ahead! Prix fixe prices from 5-20 people! Choose from appetizers and salads, pizzas and desserts with add-ons available.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I first heard about Famoso's on the day we moved to Edmonton, when we asked a neighbour about good restaurants in the neighbourhood.  We discovered this place early on and it has remained a favourite since our arrival.  I am only half joking when I tell people that we bought our home in Oliver to stay within walking distance of this place.  It's truly fantastic.

The salads?  Outstanding.  Every single one.  And I have tried all the vegetarian ones.  The appetizers?  Delicious.  Again, every vegetarian one.  Desserts?  Spectacular.  All of them.  (We sometimes even walk to Famoso just to get a scoop of their gelato).  The wine?  Fantastic.  Every recommendation from the staff has been spot on.  The coffee?  Sublime.

But the main reason we come here is for the pizza.  It is simply wonderful.  Their thin crust is crisp, yet pliable, always cooked to perfection.  And every pizza combination we have tried has been superb (and we have tried every vegetarian pizza, in both red sauce and white sauce - I love that you can switch up the sauces!).  Their seasonal pizzas are always top-notch as well.  

We've never been disappointed when coming to Famoso, oh, except when the line is longer than we were hoping.  But an hour to wait for this meal is worth it!  Totally worth it.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I give this location an 'Oh brother.""

When I went tonight, they didn't seem to have any sort of manager on duty, but a nice group of clueless girls chatting near the ice cream. In retrospect, they should have known better, which is why I realize that they were clueless. We and the two other tables ahead of us in line waited over 45 minutes for a table. There had clearly been a large amount of new tables shortly before we arrived, and yet they told all of us that it would be up to 20 minutes for a table. How does it take 45 minutes to turn one table? Everybody waiting for a table was cramped into the door area, which was miserable. I've been to many restaurants where they attempt to alleviate the stress on the door, but no effort to even recognize the brutal wait was made.

Luckily for them the food is delicious, but the experience certainly left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not going back to this location.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I could eat the caprese salad every day.
I could eat their gelato every day.
Their basil mojitos?  Amazing.
Their pizza pies are out of this world.  Who can argue with flour imported from Italy, really?  
And of course, the reason a person goes to a restaurant is to be fed ... but what puts this place over the top are the staff.  Every one is top notch.  Friendly, efficient, knowledgeable ... 

My only beefs are 1) the place is too noisy when busy -- they need some serious plants and other buffers in there and 2) the smoke isn't fanned out well enough.  Fortunately, these complaints aren't big enough to keep me away.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I love Famoso, but found this location in particular to be less than satisfactory. The environment makes you feel like your in a fast food place, and the staff treat you as such. Also dissatisfied with the pizza, it was over cooked and smothered in oil. I recommend West edmonton location, or sherwood park over this location.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"I came here with 3 other girls on a Friday evening and the place was packed. We had to wait about half an hour for a table but it was worth the wait!

This may be the best most authentic pizza  that I've had in Canada. The crust is thin and floury and there were so many toppings to chose from. 

We ended up sharing a large ceased salad, the meat wrapped cheese in tomato sauce, and two of their summer feature pizzas with fresh avocado on them.  Everything was so delicious that we didn't have room to try one of their yummy sounding desert pizzas. Next time!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Great place for classic italian. Live the pizza and purscuito wrapped cheese in a great tomato sauce. 

Never bad and I go often.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Very consistent. Good service. Pizza some of the best I've had with great ingredients. Famoso kind of wrecks it for most all other pizza locations for myself, which is a complement for sure. The prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls are outstanding.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"In one word this place was Meh!

 The pizza was burnt and the way payment works here is odd. Odd doesn't necessarily mean bad. You order everything at the front and pay right away (kind of like at McDonald's) but  the problem with that is you pretty much have to decide on everything including desert and drinks up front. You can order them after but then you have to pay again and this just becomes annoying. 

Like I said the pizza was burnt which made for an ashy taste and the meat ball (I cannot recall the actual name) appetizers were salty and mushy. I have to say the flat bread was amazing though and I would have been satisfied with just that. 

I will give this place another chance and I hope it redeems itself, but I won't be holding my breath.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Came here last Friday. Dine in service was of course limited due to the current COVID restrictions. We were able to get a booth closest to the kitchen. Food was consistent and good as usual. Table service was friendly and efficient. The restaurant was busy with pick-up/deliveries. It's nice to see the delivery window added to the parking lot side of the restaurant for ease of use.

Kids menu is always a big hit both for price point and what is offered (drink, meal and scoop of gelato). No ball of dough was offered for play (due to COVID I assume?).

I tried their pasta for the first time (rigatoni with sausage). Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Rose sauce was nice.

Husband found his prosciutto and arugula salad to have too much arugula - but easily solved by picking half of it off.

Overall felt safe dining here as tables were seated according to space. Hand sanitizer available at the door. All staff were wearing masks.",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
"Amazing pizza. Seriously. I was driving around late and hungry and saw this spot. I think it is a great place! Great staff and great food. Say no more, just go!",yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
I love famoso. I would get pizza here all the time if I could. I also love the dolce and banana dessert. I have actually gone here just to get that.,yLIn3po-fKb0T3UIoJdiyQ
