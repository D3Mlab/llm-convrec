9,Does it locates in the Beverly area?,"This is a great spot, delicious food, great atmosphere, friendly service, and good prices. A very welcome addition to the Beverly area!"
9,How much does the coffee cost,"Went here this morning for breakfast.  My husband had $14 french toast with fruit on top and coffee, I had $14 coffee, some how when we were the only two people there the cook or the waiter, more like both, FORGOT about me after they told me what I originally ordered wasnt available.  So a $14 cup of shitty coffee, that was my breakfast.  We eat out 10 times a week, we will NEVER return here.    Sadly there is no negative rating available."
9,Does this restaurant have vegan option?,"Popped in for lunch & what a little gem on 118! This cozy spot feels rustic & comfortable (a Little House on the Prairie meets coffee shop/book nook vibe. A small menu with a few surprising choices (daily breakfast until noon, burgers, sandwiches, hotdogs, bowls, etc) Prices are reasonable for the size of the portions - *funny how something could look small but really, it's the same portion size of the item if I'd make it at home, so I don't know why I think it's small??
The burger menu sounded interesting so we had a bacon cheeseburger and a lettuce wrapped lemlem burger (spicy Ethiopian patty) Both were $8 + $6 to add a side and pop. The lemlem was delicious!! Soooo flavourful, very spicy, definitely something new-to-me and I loved it. The rest of the food was good, the soup a homemade tomato bacon with dollops of creamy cheese? Sour cream?
A very cute spot and I'm curious to try their German-style burger and a poutine next time. Also vegan/vegetarian options on menu.  I also saw on they completed renos on their expansion and will double in space."
13,Does this restaurant have consistent good experience?,"I hope I don't jinx myself - but we have never had a terrible experience here. We have ordered a handful of times, our food is always fresh and hot. We've only ever had pizza and wings, but it has always been delicious. I have done delivery as well as pick up with no major incidents. I read the reviews and would probably be afraid to order from here but you should give it a try! I should note they once delivered completely raw dessert, but a couple minutes in the toaster oven and it was good to go."
13,Does this restaurant give free topping?,"So I won a 10 Pizza coupon from the fire fighters action pack when I made a donation to their fundraiser. I asked the lady at the counter if I could buy a couple extra toppings to add to my 1 topping pizza and she refused. Said the head office said no. So let me understand this... your going to make the pizza from fresh... but you won't allow me to pay for extra toppings... makes no sense. Anyways glad I did not waste my money on this pizza. It was dry and tasteless. This was your chance to showcase your pizza to a brand new customer who had never tried Busters pizza before. To gain a new customer so to speak and you blew it. I won't be back or recommend Busters to anyone."""
18,"How long was the wait?""","Last Tuesday, we were walking by the place and since I really like Vietnamese food, we decided to give it a shot.
The place was empty when we went there which should have been a flag since it was around 6 PM.
We ordered our food and to my surprise it took more than 25 minutes to get our food (empty restaurant!)
I wasn't upset yet and started taking pictures of the food and was actually still excited about the food till I had the first bite! The food was room temperature and I could not understand how after 25 minutes waiting we still received a food which was not even warm enough!
Then in the middle of eating I found a piece of metal in the food. It seemed like it was a piece from a stainless steel scouring pad!
I'm not sure how dangerous it could be if had eaten it but fortunately I saw it!
I went to the counter and told the lady about it and showed the piece and she only thanked me for bringing it to her attention!!!
Overall the only positive thing I found at the place was clean environment which is not very surprising for an empty restaurant.
Customer service, the quality of the food and the value was not acceptable and very poor.
I don't recommend this place or I wouldn't go back there again!"
18,How big is the menu?,"What can I say, this is certainly my favourite stop for Vietnamese subs in downtown Edmonton. I've stopped by twice since they reopened in this location and I've thoroughly enjoyed the chicken sate subs that I've eaten. This location is pretty unassuming, but I'm happy that they have their expansive menu. I'm not terribly fond of their bubble tea (but that's not the focus of this place anyway) instead, it's their subs that I adore and will continue to eat every so often."
18,Is it good for airline pilots?,"I am an airline pilot that has eaten Pho everywhere in the world that serves it, and this was by far the best I have ever had.  Service was fast and friendly.  An absolute gem downtown Edmonton !"
19,Is this restaurant generous with topping?,"My family and I always order double pepperoni and extra sauce for one pizza and donair for the other, most often we get the pizza from this location but when we do there's  close to one pepperoni per slice the donair pizza looked like it had two pieces of meat on the entire thing. "
19,How is their delivery service?,Horrible is an understatement. Called for delivery and told them I'm paying with debit. After waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes the guy is here with no debit machine. He said he will be back so I waited in the lobby for 15 minutes and he didn't show up so I went back upstairs to my apartment. I open my order and realize it's Hawaiian pizza and I don't eat pork. Anyways the driver calls me after an hour (3:00am) when I was sleeping hungry!
23,Could you please tell me about the cleanliness and tidiness of the restaurant's environment?,"The newest addition to the shopping area in Lynnwood, Rice Bowl fills a need for fast, affordable, quality Asian cuisine. The dozens of bowls cover a multitude of Asian styles, and include noodles as well as rice. I tried the pho soup and was surprised by the deep flavour profile of the broth. I also had a green onion cake (you have a choice between the flat cake and the doughnut shape) and it was crispy and full of onions. I also tried some of the lemon chicken - you can get that on rice or as an ""appetizer,"" which is a small bucket full of fried, lemony goodness. It had a good crunch and wasn't too sweet. "
23,Does the restaurant have ample parking available?,"Sunday take out! The Jasper Park Rice bowl delux, is brand new, bright & funky. A welcome addition to Signature Place Plaza. ~ I missed decor photo opts. This made me sad B/c the decor was well thought out,  Worth sitting in. Fresh and full of flavour. The Korean chicken was marinated, tender & cooked to Perfection. For the $12.99 tag, the chicken & veggies were light but comparable to similar Asian fare on the go. THAI Beef Fried rice was full of flavour and my picky 7 year olds favourite! DRB is a welcome change from Subway or McDonalds. I appreciate their menu options are FRESH & made to order The menu here is also VAST featuring 8 different regions of Asia. Bubble Tea & Desserts, are available.  The staff members were extremely cheering, and tendered my order swiftly. This added to a great impression ~ but they had me when I walked in the door & saw the bright decor :) Tip : Catering & Delivery available. Lots of easy parking. The plaza also hosts Second cup, BMO, Pizza 73. Adjacent ~ Bueno Pizza & Grill, Shoes on 149th, Bon Ton Bakery & some other gems. Worth a visit. GREAT HOURS 11am-10pm !!!"
25,Is this restaurant on Skip the dishes?,"Ordered delivery via Skip the Dishes based on online reviews. I have to admit I had extremely low expectations, but it's pretty good! I thought the combo C was supposed to include fried rice and not chow mein, but it was tasty and I don't want to complain. The dumplings were probably the highlight, along with the beef and veggies. All in all I think it was good value and tasted good."
28,Is there plenty of parking spots?,"My boyfriend recommended we go here for beef jerky. I thought sure why not... When we pulled into the small parking lot it was packed and I thought to myself... This is a good sign... We waited for someone to pull out and took the spot and headed in.... The smell was AMAZING! We wanted to stay and eat but it was packed and we chose not to wait, but will for sure be back. We got our jerky and headed out.... Yum and u get lots! The flavor is truly fantastic!  They have several different flavors, we tried garlic and original."
29,How long is the wait time?,"I wish you could leave a 0 star review. My family went here for dinner and had the worst experience. First we waited for a long time at the front before even seeing anyone working to seat us, then spent our time waiting for our food just overhearing the workers loud conversations and swearing coming from the back. Those can be forgiven but then both my younger sister and mother were served RAW CHICKEN FINGERS.... completely raw. This is disgusting and very dangerous as both of them could get very sick. Will never been returning to this location or any others."
34,How long is the delivery time?,"Panago Callingwood is really great! When I order delivery I usually get it in 15 minutes.  I'm not exaggerating... I MEAN 15 minutes!  My wife and I timed it last time we ordered.  Granted we're pretty close, but considering it takes 7 or 8 minutes just to cook the pizza, I'd say that's still amazing!
They've got tons of toppings, lots of crust options.
Any time I've ever had a problem with an order (and it doesn't happen often) I've always had a replacement rushed out to me and a credit to my account for next time.

Two thumbs up from a guy who worked as a pizza delivery guy while in college."
37,Is this restaurant cash only?,"Barbecue King City is one of those hidden gems in Chinatown that specializes in what else but roasted and barbequed meats. I never realized one of my buddy's parents run this place and never been. Blasphamy. Needed to change that ASAP so I went solo one Friday afternoon to grab a late lunch. 

Located right beside 97 Hot Pot and near rival Super BBQ Delight (no idea if they're actually rivals but it sounds sexy), you probably will drive/walk right by it. Maybe not though because I've seen quite a few cops drop in for lunch and you know what they say about cops...they know all the good lunch spots!

Hours are interesting as they're closed Thursday but open every other day (11am to 7pm). They have all the different types of meats (steamed, salted and roasted chicken along with pork, duck and squid) and noodles for sale. Everything is priced by the pound (around the $7-9/lb price range).

- Two item lunch box ($7.00) - yeah, you read that right. $7.00 freaking dollars for a massive lunch box filled with your choice of two meats, rice and bok choy. Yeah, you even read that last part right - you get vegetables! Almost unheard of right? Anyways, I went with the classics - char siu (BBQ pork) and siu app (roasted duck). The char sui was moist and juicy while the roasted duck was tender and had a good fat (aka. duck skin) to meat ratio. The box is basically exploding with meat and rice but I was able to finish it all. Oops.

Cash only. Seriously, for the price, you can't go wrong (if you're that hurtin', get the one meat combo for $6.00). Great spot if you want something quick and tasty to eat. So much better than CFL, just sayin'."
42,Do they have free topping?,Very delicious toppings with a huge varieties. They have vegan pepperoni and gluten free toppings and sauces.
42,Is there mobile pickup?,"Really good pizza, plenty of choice and super affordable!

You can call ahead to place your order and pick up (which means If im shopping in Save on Foods I can call and pick it up once im done shopping)
You can stop in and have it made while you wait (and they are super quick!) 
OR you can get it delivered (my favorite option - literally took them 15 minutes from us calling them to have it made and delivered to our door!)

My favorite lately is the new BLT pizza.....soooo good!"
42,Do they have vegan option?,Very delicious toppings with a huge varieties. They have vegan pepperoni and gluten free toppings and sauces.
49,How long is the wait time?,I often forget that this particular Subway location is there. But that's sometimes a good thing because when other fast food restaurants in the area had long lineups this location was nice and empty so I could get my sandwich quickly and efficiently and relax there on a Sunday afternoon for example. The staff member there was very efficient and the seating area while small was quite ample for my needs.
49,How good is their hygiene practice.,"After driving around trying to decide what to eat I decided to get a subway melt. This location is typically not bad, but my last experience here was unacceptable. After watching the employee scratch her hair with no gloves on whilst making my sandwich, once it was finally ready and to be wrapped up, she literally coughed in my sandwich and wrapped it up. I didn't even know what to say. I just stood there in shock and awe. She coughed again. I just walked out. Never ever coming back again. Aside from that, the sandwich meat had green corners. That struck me as odd. Maybe a blessing in disguise that the employee working coughed into my sandwich. Cannot trust the food or the people preparing it at this location. Jesus fucking Christ, what a disgusting experience."
49,Is there free parking,"I am a fan of this particular location.  If you have to eat fast food, at least Subway is not full of greasy hamburger that you will regret in a few hours!

The staff at this Subway are friendly and efficient.  You get your sandwiches the way you like them and they are FAST.  

I have never had to search for parking, there is free parking right out front.   

Great food, fast!"
22,Is there gluten free option?,"Stopped for lunch on the way around Edmonton and it was great! Chose to eat here for their gluten free options (I have celiac) and it exceeded expectations. I had a grilled chicken burger and Cajun fries while my hubby had the bison burger. Delicious food, great options, and friendly service. We'll definitely be stopping through again!"
22,How is the atmosphere at this restaurant,"During the summer I took my daughter here on a date. From the moment we walked in we were welcomed by the owner and I am assuming his family. The atmosphere is inviting. The menu states a few different options of burgers. I had opted for one on the menu that was beef, and asked to exchange the beef patty for turkey. The server indicated I'd have to pay extra. Which I wasn't thrilled about and just ended up ordering the meal from the menu without exchanging the meat. The burger was good. I probably wouldn't return because of the high fee for swapping an item."
22,Is there vegan option?,"We were super intrigued when we saw the sign for burger village we had to stop in. The sign reads plant based, grass-fed burgers, and exotic burgers. A great selection for everyone. We went in at around 12 and there was one other table in the place. It felt cold and super quiet so we ended up asking if we could take it to go. We went with a skinny chicken sandwich with the house salad and the classic hot dog with cajun fries. They have local beer on tap which is a great feature and the blonde beer the waitress suggested was great. The food came out in a timely manner and we took it home which isn't far. The fries and spicy mayo sauce that came with them were great. The chicken sandwich was super disappointing. The chicken was filled with a small gristly piece of chicken and had nearly no arugula on it and a few tiny pieces of red pepper. I ended up throwing it away. My husband said his hot dog was super chewy with a weird texture. The sandwiches were disappointing to be honest. 

The only reason I'm giving them a three is because the staff was super kind, local beer on tap, and the space is super clean and cute. I wouldn't go here again though. For the price tag the quality wasn't there and I was really hoping to like this place."
22,Is this restaurant on Skip the dishes?,"Noticed this place in Windermere and have been meaning to check it out. I went in on a Sunday night before closing and was warmly greeted and explained the menu. The place is spotless, very nice decor. I just tried the regular beef burger but looking forward to trying the other burgers. The food was absolutely perfect. As fresh as it gets. Good portions and great taste. I encourage everyone to support this place and dine in for the full experience instead of ordering it via Skip the Dishes!!"
3,How is the atmosphere at this restaurant,"The atmosphere is quite pleasant. There is unlimited noodles and their bubble tea selection is great. However, I will note that the tomato broth is quite bland. I'm vegetarian and therefore, I wasn't sure if I could add the chili. Other than that, you can get a nice fully belly
I've tried few different noodles and I like all of them. They also do noodle refills, which is great if you are hungry!"
3,What is the price range,"Love the place, reminds me of the motherland. We went on a cold winter day and the spicy noodles warmed us right up! Prices are super reasonable ($11.99 for a bowl with all the sides), and they come with endless noodles! I definitely refilled. 

Another thing that I highly recommend is the cheese cap drinks. The bubble tea is only alright, but the cheese caps are amazing. Recommend."
3,What is their seat availability on a regular day.,"I visited this restaurant after hearing that it offers authentic (Yunan-styled) rice noodles and that you get unlimited refills on the noodles. In terms of the restaurant, I like their setups and the service was really good even though they had a full house on a regular workday. In terms of food, I tried the traditional pork bone soup rice noodles. I am not sure if it was 100% authentic but it was definitely good. You get boiling hot soup with noodles on the side. One suggestion for those that want multiple refills is that you should ask for a refill ASAP (i.e. ask for a 2nd bowl of noodles when the first one comes) so that the soup is still warm when the refills arrive."
