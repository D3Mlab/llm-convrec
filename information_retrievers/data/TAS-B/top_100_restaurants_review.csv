But there are a couple of important cons for me. Biggest being, the music is constant and too loud, ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do: read, work, reflect, or enjoy a good conversation. When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.

Secondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.

Pros: gluten free goodies and yummy Italian sodas. I'd love to spend more time here, but the music usually drives me out after 10 minutes.",2012-11-06 23:35:15

I had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in Indianapolis, but I only found 2 that I liked and only 1 was memorable.  However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.

I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. 

The next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. 

The service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol",2015-11-19 03:51:39

I was told by a girl that cut my hair that they have the best gluten-free bread and buns she has ever tasted. She said they were so good, that she ate six buns in a row. I was excited, when I heard this, because Kinnikinnick's bread is not very good. It's like eating bricks, and it took me years to get used to it; not to mention, it only really tastes good when it's toasted. 

I've tried Breadland's arrowroot gluten-free buns. These are indeed very good. They are very soft and the outside is chewy, and they taste great with just about anything: butter, hummus, melted cheese, or peanut butter & jam. The only problem is that I can't eat them, because they give me really bad eczema on my face. I suspect it's all the yeast they put in it. The focaccia gluten-free bread they sell is also really good. This is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and I think some garlic too. It's so good, and although it contains yeast, I don't get eczema, so it must not be that much. 

These breads are very expensive though, so I only get them as a treat.",2008-12-04 08:03:31

My party had for appetizers the onion straws- really onion rings, very good but expected thinner cut due to name; the seafood queso-very good; the gumbo was reported as good ( I didn't eat any);  the fried soft shell crab plate- very good, nice size but way too many fries, should have been served on toast as most places do to for oil draining which flavors the toast; an oyster poboy and a shrimp poboy were over loaded with fresh fried seafood but on a thick ciabatta type bread-not the traditional French bread-the waitress stated they ran out-this should have been mentioned when ordering so if patron only wanted French bread there is a choice; the Westbank seafood plate was good-nice size for price with sides and seasoned well; and a Mardi salad-very fresh with a good vinaigrette. For the birthday person I requested the bread pudding-pretty presentation but improvement on the recipe needed- too dry, either microwaved too much or not enough moisture in the recipe- glad it was comp'd-would not have been happy to have paid for it. 
Overall the atmosphere was nice, pretty renovation of the place that used to be a Copeland's, all of the condiments were served in little cups, which was ok but a squeeze bottle of Blue Plate mayo was on the table, very out of place, but at least it was Blue Plate (the only mayo of Louisiana!). Finally, prices were reasonable, although the 20% auto gratuity was a bit much for a party of 5. I don't believe in auto gratuity, I know everyone doesn't tip like they should, I always do and usually give more depending on service received with a smile, but when auto, I never give more. Just my policy, I have family whom work in the service industry whom depend on their tips so I understand a lot of people don't even tip. 
I will return again to try other dishes on the menu I saw, in the future.

The bad reviews that I have read are about this gym's contract, specifically their cancellation policy which I can see why.

MEMBERSHIP.  On the application, you'll be asked for your SS#, DL#, your employer, job title along with the standards; name, address, phone #.  My doctor office asks for this ask well. Do you give out SS# and DL# readily?

CANCELLATION POLICY.  Pay $65 to go 1 month, or pay $42/month (taxes & fees, etc.) with 2-month cancellation notice.  Make sure you cancel in person and stay on them.  You shouldn't have to but that's how some businesses make money nowaday. It's the new screw-ppl-legally business model, I think. 
If you're hurt and can't come back, doesn't matter.  If they tell you it does matter, please get it on paper.

Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. 
 We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. 
  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here.

Pros:
-Tour guide was nice and somewhat knowledgeable of the cemetery and French Quarter.

-Meet up location was easy to find

Con: 
-Voodoo part was less than ten minutes long and it was inside the Visitor Center, which had nothing to do with the tour itself (used for a bathroom break and to purchase drinks/snacks)
-WALKING tour -- when the tour was booked, I wasn't even notified that the tour would be in the heat
-Though the tour guide was nice, she was very unenthused over the topic
-The cemetery tour was about an hour long. It was interesting to see the different tombstones, however, how many can one possibly see before getting bored? After a while, it was a repetition. (MAYBE visiting more than one could've been more interesting?)

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out.

1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps.  Now you have 24.  You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different.  I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

As other reviewers have said, the burgers are not good here. I usually go for a mushroom burger but instead opted for their guacamole bacon burger. It's served on an onion ciabatta roll which did not add anything to the burger except for an overly hard texture, especially when paired with the dry burger patty. The guacamole could have used some more seasoning and the thick-cut bacon was okay. 

The fries that came with the burger were salty and soggy; my husband commented that they were likely old. There was a good amount of other customers in the restaurant , so I'm not really sure why there would be old fries unless they cooked huge batches of them in advance (maybe to keep up with their promise of ""endless french fried potatoes""?). The sweet potato chips we had as an app were fresh and also a favorite with my family, so I'd suggest getting the chips instead of the fries. 

From the prices on the menu (around $9 for burgers), you'd think that the food would be good or at least a notch higher than ""decent"". Not so at Cheeseburger in Paradise.

please, go taste their awesomeness
buy it on sunday

I forgot I couldn't buy on Sunday... What's the Indy loophole?  You can buy alcohol in restaurants, wineries, and now, CRAFT BREWERIES.   Aptly named after the German form for ""beer"", I went to the most inspirationally named brewery, Bier. Mid-September, I was hoping for some fall inspired beers, but I think they were kicking the kegs for summer.  Whatevs, I tried several ""flavors"" and ended up grabbing a growler of the whit reminiscent of a Hoegaarden or Allagash White.  

Their nano-like brewing process is really brilliant.  They have different beers every week, and I imagine, it keeps the locals good and hydrated.  The taproom's pretty cool tool: lots of space, big TV, couch, darts, beer, all you need really.  

Only complaint: a bit expensive for growlers.  But you got a keep a great operation like this going somehow!  That is: moola.

I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.

The ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.

We started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. 

For our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.

Her patience with us through every step of the process was bar none.  And as a first-time homebuyer that's been invaluable.  She helped lead us through the fog to understand what we wanted for ourselves, and focus on what was most important for us, providing knowledgeable info on neighborhoods and housing options, despite our wide open search criteria and times of indecisiveness.  She even lasted through a deal that fell through after an inspection, with no hint of complaint. 

I felt like Jen was Always there for us (over what turned out to be a very long search process, from start to finish).  She was able to feed my detail oriented nature by providing answers for nearly all my questions, and sought out resources for info on all the rest.

Not quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.

Boyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  

I personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).

Friday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation.

When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. 

Saturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold.

We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it ""should be"". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is ""not their job"". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable.

-Nothing special, as they didn't reinvent the wheel, as far as these types of restaurants are concerned.
-I'm sure some women's lib group classifies this establishment as sexist.
-I'm sure the LGBT mafia will demand that Twin Peaks hires a multitude of transgender species to flaunt their stuff...you know, because 3% of the population should dictate what the rest of the nation wants.

As for the food, many are surprised that this is not your average sports food there is a nice diversity and there are many healthy options and divulgent options too for any diet or preference. The food may take a bit longer wait than expected but that is only because almost everything is made fresh from scratch in the kitchen. There is a snack bar owned by the same owners downstairs in the rink if you are more in a hurry.

Their menu has influences like Ybor City for the Ybor Eggrolls, Canadian Hockey traditional Poutine dishes, and a Tampa Bay Lightning Bleu Burger.

The chef is an amazing person who sometimes comes out to talk to customers as are all the staff including the owners, bartenders, hostess, servers, and kitchen staff.

The white and black decor is perfect. What I don't appreciate is the parking situation. My first time parking in the deck, I thought that I would get an hour free. I grabbed the ticket from the station and parked (it's very narrow and cramped FYI) on the 3rd floor. The parking spaces are not generous nor are the compact spaces truly *compact.* So, whomever your parking company is, however closely affiliated, there should be better customer service reps available to communicate that you HAVE TO VALIDATE your parking. Clear signage would be much appreciated. I'm a pretty observant person and there may have been one sign anywhere in the vicinity. Most places simply note that you've selected an hour and you don't have to reenter the ticket or it notes your ""in and out"" times and doesn't charge you for less than an hour. This is a fault that is easy to fix. Also, the attendant was less than friendly when I told him it was my first time parking there and if he could make this one exception since the place was right there - he said ""Nope. Nothing I can do"" and just waited for one of us, my co-worked or myself to pay $3.00 when we were there for 45 minutes. It wouldn't read my card w/ a chip but did read hers which also had a chip. Attendants shouldn't be rude or unhelpful. 

Therefore, in busy places like Nashville, you are only as good as your parking. That gets more people to you on a regular basis and also return customers. If it is difficult to get to you - then you'll suffer. Regardless, this business will most likely flourish but the parking company may get replaced.

Bad news for the little shops over on the other side, though.  However, if the River's Edge development is any indication, the right mix of national and local tenants, along with a pricy facelift, will bring back the old B&N strip.

Now to the new B&N!  It's clean, bright and organized.  It's also very roomy.  Not overcrowded like some bookstores are.  Maybe because they don't have much of a music selection (at least I did not see one) and that helped bring about space.  One thing that WILL keep them in business is the brilliant kids section.

I first stopped into Bier Brewery two days ago after learning of them on Beer Advocate. I was fortunate enough to show up when they weren't too busy and was able to chat with Ben and Jerry, two personable and engaging staff behind the bar, and a few other friendly customers. Bier's line-up tends to be on the less bitter side, which makes me extremely happy. Of the seven or eight beers I tasted, most ranged from 10-20 IBUs (International Bittering Units scale, a measurement of a beer's bitterness, with 0 as the lowest possible). Only one rated at 50 or above, and even that tasted delicious!

When I visited a couple days ago, I picked up a growler of Weizengoot, my favorite of the seven. It had an enticing deep-orange hue and looked simply fantastic. The first sip tasted faintly like Blue Moon, but the finish felt closer to Hoegaarden -- an excellent combination, yet still wonderfully unique. Since I had to share, the growler lasted less than an hour! I stopped into Bier again this afternoon -- Sunday growler sales in Indiana are a beautiful thing! -- but was mildly disappointed to discover  that Bier had already sold out of the Goot. Blast! 

Instead, I chose my second favorite -- Chamomille Wheat. Another delicious wheat beer, somehow light-tasting yet full-bodied? Yes, please. The growler is now nearly empty... and I didn't have to share this time!

While the prices ($12-14 for a fill) are just a touch high (I'm spoiled by $6-9 fills), they're well worth it for such fantastic beer -- and for supporting such a great, up-and-coming small business. They're such relative newcomers, their beer is only sold on the premises -- you can't buy it in any bars or stores, but I imagine that will quickly change once word gets out and they're able to ramp up production.

The bad thing is, b/c it is the same as the rest, it may be hard to find something you've never tried before- but their cheese cakes looked to be their stand apart from other bakeries. This is the only ""Asian"" bakery on this street across from Nine Ting, the new Taiwanese popcorn chicken, right by Red King BBQ, and Wong Wong Restaurant. It's a solid Chinese bakery- neither fancy nor cheap and poor quality, neither special or bland but solid if you're looking for the typical Chinese desserts and pastries 

Because it's cheap, feel free to load up on a large stash of goodies! Egg tarts were 0.80$, sesame balls were also 0.80$ and the green tea roll cake was only 3.50$.

They also increased the prices of the 'schooner' fills (to the point where it wasn't even a tiny bit of a deal) and reduced the options of what you could put in them. Service was fairly slow, but not as slow as many of these other reviews have indicated.

I'm a beer-lover who strives to always try different things, so a diverse and changing selection is essential to me. I was already really taken aback by the significant reduction in choices, but then to rename the place as a Tap Room? What a slap in the face.

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out.

1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps.  Now you have 24.  You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different.  I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

 I have been buying school uniforms for over 20 years and in many different cities.  I have never had an experience that was so bad that I had to write a negative Yelp review.

Problems:  
1.  The lack of sufficient help in the weeks prior to the start of the school year.  Getting assistance was almost impossible. 
2.   The lines were ridiculously long.  
3.  The stock of items was ridiculously low so that everything had to be special ordered and thus not returnable.  The owner Mitzi is extremely negative - says she can't take returns because she has so much stock.   If she had the stock, we would not have had to special order.  Did not put anything on the shirts but the school logo. 
4.  The wait time for ordering items was ridiculously long.   The store does not even call when they are ready as they tell you they will when you check out.  It takes numerous calls to get through to check on orders or to speak with the owner.
5.  The service after  month into the school year is no better - inefficient and unfriendly service and still no stock. 

As said by many others, this establishment has  a captive audience and I wish schools would either change their supplier or convince the owner to improve things immensely.   There really are some businesses that handle the start of school 100% better",2015-10-17 19:28:31

The space: beautiful, clean, bright....very Dean & Deluca'esque. Everything is order at the counter(s) - salad bar, sandwich & soup bar, prepared foods bar and then an open air market throughout.
The prices: it's not cheap ($10+ for brunch entrees, mimosa carafe $22)
The service: Not fair to comment, since it was the soft opening...it was exactly where it should've been for a soft opening.
The food: errrrr, I had the B.E.L.T. and my counterpart had the chicken and waffle biscuit. I felt like I wanted more to mine (more egg? more arugula? more balance?) the best part was the toasted sourdough. The biscuit...It's huge - as in, big gulp huge. I regret saying, it was a bit dry and seemed to be more on display and less tasty, but I digress, how do you eat something that big anyways.

Grits were delish, but lacked any jalapeño spice and the potatoes were actually very good, crispy and all.
Another friend had flattering things to say about the breakfast burrito as well. It was all....good.

Also, to be clear, this was a soft opening, so I think there are always things to iron out, however, this is not their first rodeo. I don't think I would personally return (I'm cheap), however, the space itself is worth a look and if you need a brunch place in this area for parents or out-of-towners it is dressed to impress, I have no doubt they'll do well.

I still can't believe the prices in here.  I was wondering what was wrong with the cake at first for that price, but it was surprisingly as delicious as it looked.  Everything in here just looks appetizing.  I like Asian bakeries because the cakes are not overly sweet as most ones are in American Bakeries.  

      I have tried the chocolate cake, and different versions of the vanilla cake here (bunny and cherry).  Both were fluffy, moist, simple, and slightly sweet.  They didn't really have any difference in taste though.  The main difference here seems to be the cute decoration.  I'm okay with that though.  I get excited like a five year old child at the idea of what cute animal or fruit I will get on my cake next.  The mango pudding was okay, but not as good as I've had in some Thai restaurants, or even what I could make at home.  I haven't tried any of the buns, but they do look tasty and are priced right.  They also offer bubble tea and smoothies here, but I haven't tried them.  I'm always too distracted by the cake.

I had a great dinner which lead right into our trip to San Francisco so I'll have to write about it later! In the mean time, just wanted to post up my visit to ROAST Coffeehouse on 104 St!

It took me a long time to make my way down to ROAST but I finally did it. As much as I love the atmosphere of Transcend (may you return to downtown one day) and Credo, I think I like ROAST the best! Something about the wooden interior, the expansive seating areas and trendy wallpaper makes it a place where I'd want to sit and relax.

Joe and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty bustling from what would have expected. Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!

For that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!

I got service immediately and was greeted by a very enthusiastic young woman. I did end up up purchasing a package based solely on the fact they smelt so darn good but was slightly shocked at the price. They are smaller than your typical grocery chain buns but the price jump obviously comes from the fact they are organic.

Upon using them with our burgers however I was quite surprised with how much better they tasted then the prior mentioned grocery store chain buns so I must admit I am torn about my experience. If value and quantity is what is important to you then I recommend sticking with the big grocery stores but if you want something high quality and healthy and can handle paying a bit more these guys are a great choice.

I will definitely come back for a coffee and individual baked good if I am in the neighborhood again but I don't think my wallet could handle regular purchases here.",2014-05-28 01:26:46

The bread itself, no matter what kind you buy, is the beautiful artisan kind - crispy and chewy and perfectly done.

I walked about 8 blocks from my hotel in my ill-fitted snow garb to the warmest, coziest ice cream shop I have ever been in. my husband had some hot chocolate....which they have about half a dozen different kinds.

however, the majority of my greatness of this review is based off of one flavor: red velvet cake. Now, I have to tell you, every red velvet cake I've ever had has been dry and not that appetizing. Like its supposed to taste good, but it doesn't.

When you walk in there is a bar area (deceptive because it is small, but it has a chalkboard menu which immediately made me love it). We had a reservation for my friends birthday so a host walked us through an arch way to a dining area, which was bustling with people eating (and there was another smaller dining room in the back!) It is family run with a few family photos on display around the dining space. The atmosphere is welcoming and filled with the smell of delicious food.

    Our waitress was very kind and attentive but not over bearing, always refilling our glasses and checking to make sure we enjoyed our dishes. We ordered calamari to start and it came out with a dijon horseradish sauce, perfectly breaded and fried calamari (very tender and amazingly tangy and sweet with some lemon sauce) over a bed of spinach which was a nice touch. 

     I then ordered the Linguine Dolano as a half order as my friends ordered the baked lasagna and the Cavatelli Broccoli. The half order was just the right size, still a decent portion and at a great price (mine was only $6). My dish was delightful; pasta tossed in olive oil with pine nuts, sun dried tomato with fresh garlic and basil. I was in pasta paradise. It was simple, refreshing, and extremely good. My friends loved their dishes as well and we were all members of the clean plate club. 

        When our waitress came back to ask if there would be dessert we couldn't turn it down--it was my friends birthday after all. Once she knew this, she created a ""sample platter"" especially for us, on the house. She brought us in house made tiramisu, a chocolate chip filled cannoli, and a dish of ice cream that was pretty amazing--everyone's favorite (possibly chocolate chip with some sort of sweet fig possibly) And all of their ice cream is from Serendipity's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/serendipity-homemade-ice-cream-st-louis) so I must say kudos for also promoting a fellow local business.

For the most part the lunches have been OK. Nothing real special to brag about. On the last visit, we ordered a Greek salad and two bowls of chili.
The bar tender is a great lady to work with and pleasant.  every time we call in an order, we are told the estimated time it will take to be ready.  Usually 10-minutes.  Every time we arrive, generally between 10-15 minutes, we have to wait an additional 5-+ minutes.  This last visit was no different.  Paid the bill, about $15.00 and went back to the office to eat.  Very disappointed in the $5.95 salad as there was virtually no lettuce and only a 1/8 wedge of tomato.  The chili was served in 20-ounce styrofoam go-cups.  The chili was Luke-warm at best.  By the way, the drive takes 4-minutes to get to my office from the retaraunt.  I have found the place an OK place as a restaurant but certainly appears to be nothing special.",2013-10-25 15:39:01

Make your own sandwich or choose from one of theirs on the menu? Make your own plate of food from various pre-made options like you're at Whole Foods (or Central Market, for my Texas friends - geez, I miss Central Market and HEB. Sorry, sidetracked)? Something for everyone. Healthy eaters? Options. Picky eaters? Options. 

I decided against their tasty sounding salads and sandwiches to try some of the pre-made options. I got some simply baked salmon, some kale salad, and some pesto grilled peaches. All of it was pretty good. They also have lots of options for snacks, drinks, desserts, etc. 

You go order what you want, they give you a ticket (or tickets if you go to two different lines or if you're paying for more than one person), and then they ring you up at the registers closer to the entrance. 

They also serve breakfast (I'll be back), and have a bar where you can order beer, wine, or coffee. (I got a cappuccino to go - very good.) 

C&B is another new Nashville spot that is trying really hard to be cool. High, high ceilings, white paint everywhere, so bright and airy you feel like you're in an aviary. Chairs that are beautiful but WILL leave a gorgeous geometric pattern in your legs and butt. I don't mind this as long as 1) the food is actually good, and 2) the prices aren't quadruple what they should be because you're paying for the decor. C&B isn't cheap. But overall, I liked the experience and the food.

Parking is rough, but there's a garage for the building just to the right of the entrance to C&B, and they validate for 1 hour (possibly during certain hours only, so I'd check that). I stayed for longer than an hour, so I paid $3 when I left the garage.

Went to one place for an estimate, but didn't seem busy and as professional bit 'rough around edges' let say.

Went down street and found Iron Horse.

Atmosphere:  
Craig greeted me as I came in. Nice man in a tie and dress shirt. We chatted a few minutes about V -Town (Ventura) and football. Very amiable man.

What struck me, which I told him, was the array of cars behind the glass window and the fellas working on them. Yes they needed repairs, but for as many cars and guys as there were it didn't come off as a oily auto shop. (not that there is anything wrong with that of course!)

Service: Excellent. I knew they would have it for several days. And it was finished on the day he estimated. Also dealt with the insurance company which I appreciated.

Pricing: I really didn't do any comparison to be honest. In truth the insurance was handling it.

Summary:
I passed by the car when I came back to pick it up. Why? It looked: So- Damn- Good. The bumper was new, paint exactly matched what I had. Absolutely recommend Craig and Iron Horse, for anyone but especially ladies.",2016-07-16 00:16:14

At Breadland, you actually are purchasing bread made from 'scratch' with wholesome and natural ingredients and the products are made by very qualified and experienced bakers.
They generally use 'organic' ingredients and tend towards staple ingredients such as spelt and use real 'sourdough'.
I love the baguettes which are only made one day a week;  Saturday.  The baguette is lovely, it is chewy and has a taste reminiscent of the breads that I purchased in Europe.  As well, their seeded bread loaf is awesome, it toasts beautifully and leaves you full.  And lastly, the white bread is terrific on it's own or used in a grill cheese sandwich: just the best.
Downside of Breadland - the bread and baked goodies are really expensive but I don't mind paying the price as I find that I am getting quality that is just not found in the so-called bakeries of grocery stores such as Safeway, Sobey's, Save-on, etc.
As well, many times my bread of choice is not available because it was sold out or you need to come back in a couple of hours....which I won't since I don't live close by.

It makes for a good place to get some beers and watch football with the guys, and at least this place is a little more unique than some of the other ones around.

I made it here on a Friday night to meet with a group of 10 friends. They had a large table reserved for us, and we were seated quickly. The place is really cool inside, with a lodge vibe that looks like something you would see up in the mountains. It was large, and it wasn't very full the one time I was here. There are more than enough TVs to see whatever sporting event you want to watch without having to turn your head very far.

Their menu consists of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and a surprising selection of dinner entrees. We ended up with a few appetizers that were pretty good, and a whole bunch of wings. I went with their ""smoked and grilled"" bone-in wings, which were phenomenal. I got them with sauce, but I would probably just get them plain with a sauce on the side since they were that good. They were some of the best wings I've had in the city. That being said, they were also pricier than most, but at least you get what you pay for.

I was surprised to see a decent selection of good local beers on tap. They also had a couple beers under the Twin Peaks brand, and quite a few of the largely distributed craft beer brands. And of course, you can always get an ice cold glass of light domestic stuff as well. 

Service, especially considering we had such a large group, was fantastic the entire time we were eating and drinking. Drinks never went empty before getting a refill and our food came out much quicker than expected. Unfortunately, for some reason that we never figured out, our server went MIA as we were wrapping up and we had to wait around a while before we could actually ask for checks. At least we were done, so the empty glasses and plates in front of us didn't need refilled, but it was still frustrating to be stuck there as we were ready to leave. If it wasn't for that snafu, the service would have gotten 5/5.

I don't have as much of a bias against large chain restaurants as the rest of Yelp tends to have, and I was very happy with what we ended up with out of this place. The food was great, our service was almost great, it is a neat place and there are lots of TVs, the beer list was probably the one shortfall and even it wasn't that bad.

We had chargrilled oysters and Rockefeller for appetizer. Entree: 2 lobster pasta, crawfish etouffee, 8oz filet mignon, chicken Caesar salad,  crab cakes, and Mac and cheese. The sad part is no one liked their food. Lobster pasta tasted like they just dumped a can of tomato paste in the pasta and mixed it into the linguine and the lobster was over cooked which caused it to be chewy. Crawfish etouffee was too salty. Filet mignon tasted like a over cooked sirloin it came with potatoes and vegetables that look like the whole plate been sitting under the light for a long time. As for the chicken caesar salad the chicken was so dry and it had way too much dressing on the plate and it was too creamy. Crab cakes barely had any crab in it and it was just full of stuffing. We ordered Mac and cheese for my niece and it looked like it was made from a Kraft box and dried. My niece usually eats her Mac and cheese and this time she ate a little bit and didn't want it.

Since there were seven of us, we made reservations--however, when we arrived at 7 p.m. the place was only moderately full. A nice little crowd, but not loud and bustling (well, until we got there at least...). The ambiance was lovely and the restaurant had a front ""bar"" area and a back eating area that was larger than I expected it to be. Of course, the lights were set to ""romantic"" mode (as they are in most Italian restaurants) and so I apologize in advance for the poor quality of my photos.

First things first, we decided to order a couple of bottles of wine [priorities are important]. We were tickled to find that the wine list was longer than the list of food--so we had plenty of options. We got one bottle of red and one bottle of white and both were very tasty.

Since we figured that drinking our dinners wasn't a smart or grown up thing to do, we ordered salads to start the meal. They were pretty standard ""house"" salads. Though, one twist was that it had provel cheese on it--which normally I am not a fan of; however, combined with the crisp lettuce and sweet red onions I didn't mind it one bit.

Next was the main course. I ordered the lasagna and it was a-ma-zing. Like, melt-in-your-mouth, moan at the dinner table good. It had sooo much cheese. You can't go wrong with cheese, in my personal opinion.

It was served with two pieces of garlic toast that had a nice crunch to them and I really enjoyed eating a bite of my lasagna on a piece of my garlic toast. It was straight-up comfort food and I am certain that it was extremely fattening. But, who are we kidding, you can't eat that much cheese without expecting a few extra calories, right? 

Around the dinner table, the rest of the girls all got some sort of pasta dish and ordered half sizes, which seemed like a perfect sized  meal (especially if you had gotten a salad as well). Everyone claimed that their food was very good; however, I didn't hear the other girls moaning about their food like I was (though, maybe I'm just overly passionate about it...?).

Needless to say, I'd recommend the lasagna if you ever get a chance to stop by. In fact, I'm going to be so bold as to say that 1) that lasagna was the best lasagna I've ever eaten and 2) you are a fool if you get anything else! (Unless you are lactose intolerant... then, by all means, avoid the cheese-coma that is inevitable if you eat this meal.)

I would also recommend that you go when you have a little extra time. Although it didn't bother me, a few of the girls noted that the service was a bit slow [especially considering that the restaurant wasn't very full]. I think we had sat at the table for a good 30 minutes before ordering our food. Then again, we had ordered wine... so who really noticed? Plus, if you've ever been to Italy you know that getting a waiter to help you there is like some sort of Olympic challenge. Italians are just a little more leisurely than Americans are (or... a LOT more, to be honest). So, perhaps Ricardo's simply likes to provide a truly cultural Italian dining experience.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed the meal at Ricardo's and would definitely recommend it to a friend. So, next time you're in the Square, be sure to check it out!",2011-11-03 20:00:22

Just like many other BN stores, it sells overpriced books (few sales and few coupons) and CDs/DVDs. You can also pay the overpriced BN member rewards card ($25 a year) with little benefits ( -- 10% extra discount for members and some coupons sent via e-mail).  The store has a coffee shop that serves Starbucks coffee, pastries and sandwiches. Nice coffee shop. Great sugar cookies!!! Yum.

Here are my issues with this particular store:  

1) The space is limited and crowded. It has very limited seating in the books area. You have to bring the books to the coffee shop area if you need to read. I usually go there when I have specific things I'd like to buy, check their website first if they have the items ""in-stock"" and leave when I am done.

2) The children section is not great either, small area, no place to sit, too many dolls, toys and knick knacks that distract the children from getting the books.

3)  Cold staff - except for few people who work in the Children area, I have never had any one who is friendly. They need to smile... 

Despite all of the negatives, I think this particular BN store is doing a great job in fulfilling their social responsibility. BN has provided a space for area schools to have their Annual Bookfair for fundraising and Art Fair. In addition, they also offer 30% discount for teachers.",2010-08-31 14:50:16

It was extremely hot outside and we made the mistake of walking here from our condo (not my smartest idea). So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). 
However, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty. We sampled the jalapeno grits which sounded amazing but were pretty forgettable. 
We had a nice experience here overall, and I really want to come back and check out their cheese plates and wine in the evening.",2017-08-08 02:28:41

I would absolutely recommend this supermarket for the everyday sort of items or those you typically stock up on - canned goods, toiletries, paper items, household cleaners, dry goods, etc. There are amazing deals all the time on the things we use/consume the most often. The place is relatively clean, although once, someone snuck their little rat dog in and it pooped in a shopping cart/onto the floor in the frozen section and it was not cleaned up right away at all - AND they left the cart (w/ poop and all) right there for everyone to walk by and gag.

If it's produce you're trying to buy, Iovine's in the Reading Terminal Market is even cheaper for 100x better quality products. However, the produce isn't horrid here either. I WOULD NEVER BUY SEAFOOD OR MEAT here - items like Purdue chicken/turkey where you KNOW the items have been packaged securely and cannot be reopened are OK. The deli counter is the slowest this side of the Mason-Dixon and I have encountered several employees who have mis-priced cold cuts (make sure you check their work). I even had one experience where the guy yelled AT ME for not telling him it was on sale... he specifically said ""How am I suppose to know what's on sale all the time?""... ummmmm... yeah. So, customer service is definitely not enforced in the store - not to say that every employee is a jerk. 

Sometimes, items marked on sale in the circular aren't marked on sale on the shelf - I usually forgo the items especially on large trips when I often forget to make sure the prices come up correctly at the register. NEVER GO ON THURSDAYS - the aisles are a mess w/ new products and price stickers go missing b/c new sales start on Fridays. By Sunday, most items on sale have not been restocked from the weekend masses either. 

If you are bringing your own bag(s), don't use the self check out lines... the scales are retarded and the employees aren't usually the most observant or even locatable when you need assistance. 

If you ride a bike, like me, and typically can only buy what you can carry on your back, there is a bike rack and other poles and such available to lock up to - never had a problem with that.",2011-02-24 20:27:06

I've had the Greek salad, buffalo shrimp , and the mozzarella fries ! Omg! You can't go wrong and they are open late on the weekends starting from Thurs - Sunday when everyone else is closed. 

I order here at least once a week ....okay sometimes twice ...okay since we're being honest maybe 3 times hahaha. I just love the fries & who says potatoes aren't healthy. Thank goodness for this place being open late in Ardmore because a little piece of me dies when I find out they are closed.",2016-09-20 09:35:49

I've often been told they don't make it, or that it's sold out, or that it's on the baking schedule for one weekend a month. I had almost given up when I decided to check out Breadland. I was at the registry, anyway, so why not?

I didn't even look at everything they offered. I immediately asked the salesperson if their rye contained caraway, and she answered in the affirmative. I purchased a $5 loaf, squeeing all the while about having finally found real rye bread in Edmonton. I'm pretty sure the woman thought I was crazy. And the best news is that they make it every day.

As soon as I got out the door, I had to gnaw off a piece to make sure it was true. IT WAS! Once my excitement had passed and I was able to evaluate the bread in an objective fashion, I decided it needed more caraway seeds. Otherwise, it was pretty damn good. Upon arriving home, hubs was really excited, too. We consumed the entire loaf in one evening.",2012-11-08 17:40:56

First impression, when one thinks about a breastaurant, they think about bubbly personalities, big beautiful smiles, wings and beer.  Even if not any in depth conversation is had, it's not hard to approach a table with a smile.   When Tabatha first approached she has no smile and felt like she had better places to be.   No smile, no interest in the table (a tip for any waiter or waitress and isn't rocket science that's how one makes it in the industry working off of tips) which could have been fairly easy for her as it was just me a harmless 34 year old whom had been cutting down trees for several hours earlier to help a friend who can't do it on their own and as it was 95 out all I wanted was a cold beer and sandwich and the peaks was less than 5 blocks from the house I was at.  I had my girlfriend's nephew with me and had him helping me work outside.  He's  a harmless 18 year old who was more interested in the soccer game on the tele than the women working.   I ordered a BLT and he ordered a Philly.  Both were fresh, fairly fast and quite good.  I asked for pepper and it took a couple minutes, but it finally came.

On a hot day, the line can be backed up to the door. But it's worth the wait. My favorite is their red velvet cake ice cream. Way better than Ben and Jerry's version of that flavor!

They also have shakes, coffees, and maybe even smoothies. I've only have had the ice cream.

Don't cry too hard about it, Chum Hums, because walking in, the ghost of Chumley's past seemed to be floating around.  Two weeks in, the setup is the same, the TVs are still in prime locations, and the local beer is all there in drafts, cans, and bottles.  

However, there are changes in the several menus given to you, starting with the cocktail menu.  Our server boasted that the head bartender studied the art of old timey cocktails intensely, reading for six months straight before ever picking up a bottle.  It seems to be the new pride and joy of Village Tap Room.  I apologize for not being about to tell you more about them, because I'm a beer gal through and through.  I can say that I drank my 3 Floyd's Yum Yum with great content, knowing that it was one of many, many beers and ciders to choose from.

And now my pride and joy: food hunting.  Most of you know that I make it my mission to find something tasty everywhere I go.  Smack dab in the center of the food menu was PUFFY TACOS in caps.  I tried to steer away from it--it could be a ploy--but your standard steakburger and tenderloin pub fare were not calling my name.  I chose shredded chipotle chicken as my protein (other options are chorizo, short rib, and pulled pork)  and mango salsa (I wasn't in a charred chipotle mood) to accompany it.  Two puffy tacos and $7 later, I feel confident about my decision of inflated fried flour tortillas stuffed with tender, spiced shredded chicken, sprinkled cheddar cheese, diced tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce, and mango salsa.  I like knowing that I have a solid go-to if someone wants to sit along the windows, people watch, and drink a pint.

I can overlook the fact that the place was smoky, due to the fact that there could have been people ordering the saganaki, but there were no redeeming qualities.  Between the three of us, we ordered three drinks.  Two were beers, which is hard to mess up.  The last was supposed to have been a cherry vodka with sprite.  We instead got regular vodka with sometime resembling sprite (with about as much carbonation as a glass of water) and grenadine.  Needless to say, it didn't taste great.  I then ordered the saganaki.  The less than enthusiastic male who brought it out seemed to have added too much oil or something.  It proceeded to continue sizzling and shooting oil all over our table after he put it down.  The bottom was charred and stuck to the pan before it was even cool enough for us to take a bite.  We decided that we were going to cut our losses and head across the street to Fortel's.  We were charged for everything, despite that fact that we only had one bite of the saganaki before decided it was too burnt to eat.  Don't go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The location is pretty easy to get to as long as it isn't rush hour, and they have plenty of parking in the parking lot for the strip mall of businesses that they are set up in. There is quite a bit of outdoor seating in a patio area in front of the business, and a lot more seating inside that is composed of some second-hand mismatched furniture (including a few couches). Ordering is done at their bar that has a large chalkboard behind it with the available beers on tap.
 
It's a fairly busy interior with lots of stuff hanging everywhere, including a significant amount of awards that they have won for their beers. There are also lots of branded items that you can buy. They have 6-packs of their canned beer already cold that you can purchase to-go, or you can make a build your own 6 pack. You can also fill growlers here. The beers from this brewery are always done exceptionally well for the style, but they also lack some of the more unique beers that a lot of other breweries like to make. They have 8 or 9 beers on tap at any time, and they usually cover a decent spectrum of beer styles. This is definitely a brewery that isn't going to put out anything that isn't done well.

They have quite a few unique events here that can be easily found on their website, including a night especially for dogs, live music, and even a euchre night. Wednesday is their pint night with the fantastic offering of $4 pints. There was a food truck here the last time I visited, but I think that is only a once a week occasion (but don't quote me on that). They did have a few snack items available if needed to buy something to tide you over while drinking. 

I don't make it here very often since it requires a drive to get here, but it is definitely a stop I would make if I was going to be in the area. If you like great beer in a relaxed atmosphere, this is definitely your place. Additionally, and this may be a little judgmental of me, but the crowd here seems to be a little more ""normal"" than some other breweries.

Still I like the oil and recommend it to others, just for my personal preference I like something that you can smell for longer then a few hours.

He stocks a wide variety of men's items and you can see right away why the shop has won numerous awards for it.  Great store, a small drive from the west side, but worth checking out.

They seem like they are going for more of a wholesale bakery rather than retail since the show case was rather sad. We arrived at 10:45 on Sunday but there was no sign of life. We thought they were closed but we asked a chef who was just arriving to work and he said they opened at 11.....kind of odd for a bakery. We had the blueberry hand pie. It was good but probably not worth $6.50.  No espresso drinks but they had drip coffee. We will come back again in the future when they aren't so new.,2016-07-18 02:41:52

sOa-K_G5IUThtxWSponv2g,aDCfD0psGAleSQ3L0oX-XQ,qfWJmJ0g96eM_fWma3ja0g,1.0,2,0,0,"I went with a friend about 2 months ago and overall, we enjoyed it. This time, I went for a formal dinner with my family and it was a bad experience - none of us will ever return. 

To start things off, we made reservations and were seated at the back of the restaurant where every 20-60 seconds, a door would slam. The heavy slam of the door was noticeably distracting and shook our booth! It would interrupt our conversation and made it difficult to enjoy our meal. So, we had to move tables. However, the waitress - who was less than friendly and outgoing and only grew more sour faced as the night continued - found it appropriate to then move us to a seat directly across the bar instead, without telling us where we were going first. This new seat was hardly better, though we supposed it was the lesser of two evils. 

As the meal continued, we ordered lobster macaroni and the Asian shrimp for appetizers. Both were good, yet we did not get bread and butter until after our appetizers were served and cleared from our table, which we found to be a little odd. Usually, bread and butter comes first, doesn't it? Though it was not too big of a deal in and of itself, it only reflected on how unorganized and out of sorts the waitstaff seemed. 

We ordered our mains, and here is where things became even more problematic. One member of the party ordered filet with potato and green beens, and the beans were crunchy and uncooked, the potatoes dry, and the filet very fatty. Later when our extremely pleasant waitress returned with her typically less than interested attitude to our table, we expressed our concern about the filet and vegetable plate when she asked how the food was...yet she barely reacted with more than an annoyed 'sorry', as if we had done something wrong. If a waitress is going to inquire about the meal but then does not do anything for her displeased customer, why even bother asking in the first place, I wonder...?

I ordered lobster with corn and potatoes, and this was my first time ordering a real lobster dish. I had tried lobster previously and loved it; I figured if Docs is supposed to be an esteemed seafood restaurant, why not try a classic dish? However, for such an expensive plate, I was extremely disappointed. My 35 dollar entree came served without anything to crack the shell and no cocktail fork; another waiter helping the waitress serve acted annoyed when asking for utensils and a plate (can you see a theme here? The waitstaff is either overworked or simply unfriendly!); and the lobster was EXTREMELY tough and chewy, to the point where I was unable to cut it properly, if at all, and it tasted disgusting! Lobster is mild, but it is NOT supposed to be tough and 100% flavorless. I was very displeased. A new waitress I had to flag down appeared vexed though tried to help me. Then, someone - presumably the manager - came instead of our original server and we were told a new lobster plate would be served 'in just a few moments'...yet even after having the chef come out to reassure us, I did not receive my new lobster until 10:05 PM. I waited well over half of an hour for the new lobster plate. Admittedly, I was slightly pissed when our original waitress came out with the lobster just as we were getting ready to leave, and asked if she could box it up. I felt like telling her to take the box and shove it!

It was simply because by that point, we were very tired and tired of being at the restaurant where things had gone from bad to worse. After having at least four different waiters, three of which were aloof and annoyed, and terrible service along with mediocre food, we wanted OUT. Thankfully, the lobster was taken off of the bill, yet for a less than satisfactory evening we paid close to 80 dollars. 

The bottom line: Do not waste your time at this restaurant. Food is a hit or a miss, unpredictable quality and service! There is NO consistency with service and food at Doc Magrogans. Please save your time and money and go to a refutable and classy restaurant such as McCormick and Shmicks or someplace else decent. This restaurant is best for those who want to mess around at the bar and order apps vs. for a group or party coming for a nice lunch/dinner. (And on a final note, I feel it's good to mention that if you're looking to be able to hear by the end of the night, AVOID AVOID AVOID.)",2013-06-09 02:41:55

I picked beef which tasted like bulgogi (Korea. Style sweet/soy marinated beef) and it came with a perfectly over easy egg on top. The red sauce that was on the side was perfectly portioned (even though the guy gave me extra) i could see it being a little spicy for people who can't handle the heat so just be cautious and taste before you mix!!!

But after I got home I somehow activated the alarm system and could not step on the brake without my car siren sounding obnoxiously; essentially, I had a car that I couldn't drive. Contacted AM&PM yesterday and had an appointment for this morning for the car to be looked at; also, I wanted to make a spare key since I was only given one master key. 

Well, I think I was somehow lost in the system because the technician did not show within the time frame. But after I called back I was told that he would be there within the hour, and everything went uphill from then on. Shay was courteous and professional and disarmed the alarm system and made a transponder key for me in no time. The key cost $145 (so it's definitely more than what the previous reviewer paid for but I think it also depends on the car; I think $145 is still reasonable for a transponder key though); all in all I got me a new key and a drivable car for $225 so I think that was pretty decent. I am satisfied with the service and will use them again if I ever have the misfortune of experiencing lock problems in the future.

Edit: Not even 20 mins after this review was up Shay called and apologized for being late to the appointment. He stated he would refund the service fee.

Though I noticed the variety of gifts and cards, I had my attention drawn to the chocolates counter.  (They have a variety of other types of candies including a jelly bean wall and some other fruity type treats.)

After looking over the displays a couple times, I asked and found out that you can buy the chocolates by the piece or by the pound.  I thought it best to go with individual pieces and limited my purchase so that my waistline stayed relatively the same size as when I started the day.  I decided to get a pecan snapper in milk chocolate (snapper = turtle), a cashew snapper in milk chocolate, and a dark chocolate covered pretzel.  
Because the pieces are handmade, they are on the pricey side.  (After tax, it was nearly $8!)

The flavor was really good.  The snappers were fairly large compared to the ones you see in those assortment boxes.  They were filled with nuts and creamy gooey caramel.  The only problem was that since it was a hot day, I had a bit of a mess as the chocolate melted.  (Fear not, I am not above licking my fingers to savor the last bit of it!)

It is a little bit smaller, but much brighter and cleaner (especially the washrooms). There is an area for music with a drum kit and several guitars. I guess if you are hanging out here and get inspired you could just grab an instrument and start improvising. My coffee was pretty good and a very large mug for $2. Best of all, now there is wifi with a purchase, although there are still computers available to use if you don't have your own. Really cool vibe here.",2013-02-05 17:01:52

Clean store, Quick Service, Good Customer Service

Overview:
Because of the convenient location, I use this UPS store about once every six months to return items I purchase online, which have prepaid shipping, primarily.  One of the *bonus* things I did not know, and sometimes forget about, is that many UPS stores will take your styrofoam to reuse.  Awesome!  This UPS store took my styrofoam that was included with a television set I had recently purchased.  

Store:
The store is quite clean.  A little on the small size, but I think more than adequate for the services they offer.   

The person I mainly interact with at the store is a gentleman that I believe is the owner.  He has always been fairly pleasant.  I must admit, I get a sense that shipping prepaid packages is not really valued, and so getting ""moved along"" through the process is paramount.",2011-08-01 03:45:56

5Q7t1zDBGdE3baJrn8-Lww,wXdbkFZsfDR7utJvbWElyA,7clCBgNbd-x2Wj96lZ6Mjw,4.0,1,0,1,"Once I walked in from the patio on the north side of the building, the first thing I noticed was a wall loaded with awards for the prize winning ales that this place has won at the Indiana Brewers Cup.  Since 2012, it seems Bier Brewery has had prize winners.  So the bar is set pretty high for your drinking experience.

I have had a number of their canned beverages around town.  They make a variety of brews including Special K (kolsch), Weizengoot (Hefewizen), and PDG (""Pretty Darn Good"" American pale).  I have enjoyed them all!

The interior is dim and filled with assorted tables, chairs, and a lounge area.  The restrooms have been designated as Stouts and Blondes, so I guess that is understood to be gender neutral (I hope so since I am neither stout, at least not yet, or blonde!)

In the back corner is the counter/tap area with a list of the current taps artistically displayed on the chalkboard.  One thing I liked was that the counter has several laminated flip folders describing each of the featured brews.  I am still learning about craft beers, so I enjoy reading the details of each brew when available.

My only negative was that the brewery doesn't have flights of beer to sample.  Instead, they give free samples in small plastic cups.  In fact, you can try everything they have on tap!  But I found the samples too small (they said 3 oz, but they actually were only partly filled so about the size of a shot) to be able to distinguish the uniqueness of each brew, especially if you don't get a glass of water to clear the taste of the previous sample.  Of the four samples I tried, only the seasonal pumpkin ale stood out and the spices overwhelmed the beer and pumpkin flavors.    For me, I would prefer a legitimate four or five ounce sample to see how the flavors hold up to appreciate the nuance of each selection.  That's why I like the flights.  I don't want to buy a whole pint and find out that I may not like how the taste develops.  

I know the brewery makes good beer, so even though I was disappointed with my visit to the brewery/taproom, I don't need to see the awards to know this place will continue on the right path.  I simply wish they would add the option of flights like so many of the other breweries around town.

We walked in at about 3:45 on a Wednesday afternoon in December (about an hour ago), so it wasn't busy AT all. No one at all was in front of us in line. The younger guy with a chip on his shoulder and an ""I'm SO over tourists"" attitude barked at us when we asked what was in the different flavors of ice cream. Again, the place was empty except for us. It's not like we picked a very busy rush time to ask questions (And I'd point out that even if we did, it's not appropriate to be that cold to customers, regardless.) We had our two scoops pushed toward us. No one cared enough to point out where spoons were or anything. In fact, the guy ""waiting on us"" (using this term VERY loosely here) wandered away and we sort of stood awkwardly at the cash register until another employee noticed us and rang us out. Unreal. On our four day trip to Nashville, we stayed downtown and were treated politely everywhere we went. Except here.

We were fortunate that both tours were very small, so we had the undivided attention of the guides and likely got a lot more details than large tours.

Martha led the ghost tour, and she opened with saying she does her own kind of tour that's different from what a lot of the other guides provide. I'd taken this same tour last year with Spirit, and hers was definitely different. I'm not saying she's a skeptic, but her delivery of some stories (like the LaLauries) was very stripped down from what I'd heard on the prior tour. I appreciate honesty and certainly don't want to be lied to, but I also am not opposed to a little embellishment in order to heighten the experience. However, she was obviously very knowledgeable and provided a good tour.

We had Adam for our cemetery tour, and he was incredible. He talks very fast, so you have to pay attention, but that was not difficult. He is a wealth of information about the city, and we hung onto every word. The tour ran a little long because he had so much to say and was very receptive to questions that might take us on a short verbal detour. We spent the most time in St. Louis Cemetery #1 where we learned a lot of great history regarding the residents of this resting place. We then moved onto the visitor's center for much-needed seats in air conditioning where he talked about voodoo and its part in the history of New Orleans. Unfortunately, we took this tour on our last day there and had to leave it early to get to the airport, so we missed the tour of Louis Armstrong Park. 

I highly recommend Spirit Tours. I know there's a lot of options, but they really do a great job and employ very knowledgeable and affable guides.",2015-10-19 21:35:05

Then, almost as if by magic, one day Mike Ice Cream appeared.  Mike's, I was informed by the pretty girl behind the counter, was owned by the same people who own the Sip Cafe in East Nashville.  And, in fact, most of the ice cream is made in Sip Cafe's kitchen there.

Once you taste it, you know that it is NOT the generic stuff you find at the ice cream places connected to grocery stores of the thirty-some-odd flavors place around town.  Now, it's not Ben and Jerry's either, but they're not trying to be.

Mike's is that locally-owned place that everyone knows they can go to for good locally made ice cream.

The Cemetery tour was ok; our guide wasn't a great story teller but got the point across.  I think we were spoiled by Confedereacy of cruisers tour we had taken the day before.  

The second day, the Ghost tour started off rocky when we showed up and our tour guide was disappointed it was just 2 of us (understandably), then tried to suggest we join another tour as once we get started (again, somewhat understandable), but when my boyfriend went to the ATM for money and his card was rejected by mistake,  I heard our guide walk outside and say to a friend in a smirky manner  that 'she not only had two people, but now and we can't even pull money out of the ATM' (NOT COOL!).  We thought cash was better since the other tours asked for cash only, but she treated us like second class people because we wanted to use cash and didn't charge it before hand . . . strange!! Maybe I should have charged her tip too . . .  I was close to just telling her we are good with not doing the tour! 3 more people showed up and her mood changed a bit.

First off, our server was so friendly and patient! He let me try a couple of flavors before ordering, and let me tell you, given how many yummy flavors they have it's really hard to choose. I ended up getting the white chocolate banana pudding ice cream on a sugar cone and it was so amazing. There's lots of chunks of banana, white chocolate, and the pudding throughout the ice cream. It tasted like authentic banana-not artificial banana flavoring (which is key with anything banana). 

My fiancé got a chocolate milkshake and he loved it. Another thing worth noting is their selection of hot chocolate. They literally have every and any flavor imaginable, and if I wasn't craving ice cream so much I would've tried their hot chocolate.

The drink order got mixed up and it took over 20 minutes to get a draft beer (the place was not that busy). We ordered two appetizers and all our entrees, and when the appetizers came it was only one. Later the waitress came back and said they were out of the second appetizer. After about thirty minutes half of the dinner orders came out, and then the waitress told us they were out of one of the dinners we'd ordered. Another fifteen minutes later and still half of our party were missing their food, the waitress came back and told us they were out of yet another one of the entrees we ordered. 

The waitress said the manager was going to come and talk to us, but she never did and in fact, it looked like she was avoiding us. Finally, I got up and found the manager, told her about everything that had gone wrong and told her we were leaving.

Both times we had larger parties and they were so flexible in terms of splitting dishes, providing extra plates, etc.  They also allow you to order a half portion during their dinner hours which I really appreciated! 

The food here is delicious! I have sampled their salads (House, Spinach, & Caesar), some of their appetizers (calamari), their entrees, as well as a few of their desserts and have been very pleased both times.  Their menu provides a wide variety of basic Italian dishes.  In my experience, there has always been something for everyone.  Their seafood canneloni is delicious but definitely a little bit rich.  I would recommend sharing a half or full portion with a friend.  I have also really enjoyed the Linguine Louisa, being a big fan of red sauce, mushrooms, and eggplant!  

So, in conclusion, I would say four stars for the food, but five stars for the service and the experience.  The staff has made both parties I was with feel very welcome and taken care of.  We never felt rushed to leave.  Additionally, there is plenty of parking around the nearby Lafayette Park.

It's always hot this time of year, but that almost doesn't matter as there is a ton of shade! The Sun King beer garden also had covered seating and other tables with umbrellas for relief from the hot sun. 

I recommend parking at the park for $5. You can take a free shuttle to city hall for free parking, but you are limited to the hours it runs so parking at the park gives you a little more freedom to come and go as needed. It was organized very well and they made parking very orderly and spacious so that it was easy to get in and out. 

I haven't attended the parade or the fireworks they do every year, but they have quite the turnout for the parade as evidenced by all the chairs and blankets that are set up beforehand!

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Unlike some of the new-age ice cream spots that have sprung up across the country (Salt & Straw http://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-and-straw-portland-2?osq=Salt+Straw and Smitten http://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-3 come to mind), Mike's is your traditional ice cream parlor right in line with some of the gems in New York and Chicago. The flavors are on the board, the cones lined up in their stands, and the servers fast and friendly. What more could you want? Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Very much unlike the new age spots, the prices at Mike's couldn't be more affordable, and my single scoop in a cone, which was sizable as you can see in the picture, was priced at only $3.50. That's value. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Before going into my actual Caramel Cone selection, I'll point out that Mike's wins when it comes to flavor variety. Simply too often I've rolled into modern ice cream or gelato spots only to find that I either have basic chocolate and vanilla to choose from or some kale and blueberry goat cheese nonsense. Mike's leaves the gentrification at the door, offering up a huge selection of classics, contemporary flavors, and combinations of the two that are sure to satisfy anyone. 

My caramel cone in particular was very, very good, with the right ratio of caramel to cone and ice cream. Single Star Granted.

The French Press coffee for 2 works well. Good flavor while being nice and hot. Enjoyed  the hash with a poached egg on it. My husband loves the breakfast burrito with avocado, egg, chorizo, cheese and potato.

We strive to find dog friendly, outside areas with shade and this is about as good as it gets in town. Rarely do we have to wait for a table and all outside tables are shaded. 

The downsides- paper plates and plastic utensils..... I am not a prude but this just makes less formal and delish-- also we talked to the manager about the coffee mugs. There is absolutely no way to carry this mug OR drink from it without burning your fingers. We even had the manager try it.  He absolutely agreed and said he would replace them immediately.

First impression was confusion with two entrances and people did not know where the line formed. If you want to order breakfast, coffee, wine, you stand in the front line. If you want to order a salad, walk to the back of the restaurant. If you want to order prepared foods for later, walk to the back of the restaurant. No signage or direction was really given.

Ordered the fried prosciutto sandwich with spinach and poached egg with a side of parmesan potatoes. The hizzy (husband) got the brunch burrito and jalapeno grits. I asked for hot sauce and was told to go to the front to get it. Very inconvenient. They only have ONE bottle of hot sauce for the whole restaurant by the entrance. Not even by the eating area. And it was empty.  While my fresh food sat at the table 75 feet away, I had to wait for someone to refill that bottle. Like had to go to the back and refill. No extra bottles anywhere. The sides were both delicious! Although, jalapeno grits need some spice. I tasted no jalapeno. False advertisement. The potatoes were yum. My sandwich was less than desirable. Not very flavorful. The burrito was very good! Meat filled and a good blend of flavors. Prices were affordable. The huz thought they could have charged more for the burrito, but was happy they did not.

The chairs and tables are so pretty, but the chairs are too short for the tables. Now, I am short so this is exaggerated for someone like me. My husband who is almost 6' tall felt the same way. He actually mentioned it first. It is nice to have pretty decor, but utility should be first for a restaurant. We did not like the flow of the space. That line is really blocking the rest of the restaurant off. It was just awkward. 

Parking is definitely an issue, but if I lived close by, I would totally walk in for a salad or prepared meal. Just be prepared to drop some cash. $13/pound under 3 lbs of purchase for the prepared foods. $11/lb if over 3 lbs. Whole foods and Turnip Truck is almost half this price for the prepared foods.

I still enjoy the chocolate cherry latte, it's not as sweet as it sounds. The pumpkin pie latte is also good, and I hear the chai hot chocolate is a treat too. The toasted marshmallow latte is quite sweet though, just to warn you. For a cold option, I like the coconut frap .. it's nice and light, not too sweet. You can switch between cold and hot for most of these options though.

I've always found their pastries to be delicious and never stale, unlike other coffee houses. The lemon swirl is to die for, if you like a strong lemon taste -- lots of flavour in every bite, with chunks of chewy lemon. Yum! The cinnamon swirl and chocolate croissants are also tasty. I was sad when they discontinued their key lime cookie, those were delicious! Unfortunately it wasn't popular enough so they took that off the menu too.

Their delivery guys have always been prompt and courteous.

I read on here that they have difficulty getting people's orders right. I personally don't think that sort of thing should be a surprise; sometimes, a takeout place is going to get your order wrong. More importantly, it's what they do to fix it. On a few occasions my very specific order was improperly interpreted, so I sent them an e-mail.

VWs require special keys with a security chip in them, so they cannot be made at any hardware store.  Dealers are notorious for overcharging and ripping you off. I searched a VW internet forum to educate myself on the requirements for the keys and the proper method to find a locksmith who specialized in them.

some googling and checking of reviews brought me to AM&PM

The owner, Shay, was able to set me up with an appointment the same day and he was even able to meet me sooner than scheduled-- as I had told him how dire the situation was with the key and such.

Once I made it to AM&PM, Shay had my key made in @5-10 minutes. The prices were right in line with what I had found on the internet and without any dealer scams or hassles.

As a bonus, Shay provided me with a more useful key than the only one I had left. 

The VW keys come in different forms--remote, master, and valet.

You cannot re-program a remote without two keys--one of which must be a master.

All I had was a valet key, but Shay's machine cuts them as a master.  So, now if I get a remote key from ebay or amazon I can program it myself.  Shay was also kind enough to offer me a discount on cutting the blanks for any remote keys I bring in.

--However, keep in mind that YMMV when it comes to programmability of keys, fobs, and remotes. Some cars have special computer settings and will only recognize a key if you specifically re-program the car computer to do so. This will necessitate a trip to a dealer or knowing someone with the proper computer interface for your car. My VW was an older model, so it does not have this issue. I did not ask Shay if he had access to the computer stuff needed to program the keys for newer model VWs.

In any case, I got another key made fast, it worked perfectly, and it is the better key to have than the valet key I had (which cannot open the trunk.) Now I can open every lock on the car and re-program remotes if needed.

If you read the other reviews you will find that they are uniformly excellent.  This locksmith treated me right and I would not hesitate to recommend him. Shay turned what I thought was going to be a complete hassle into a manageable situation and his work was impeccable.

Atmosphere: decorations were an interesting mix of tacky and elegant. The music was not the usual generic random-Asian-string-instrument, but J-pop! And artists I actually knew, such as X Japan and Hamasaki Ayumi.

Service: attentive, polite, helpful.

And the food! Yummy. (Yes, I went there.) I ordered an $11 three-roll sushi lunch, with East, Spicy Salmon and Eel Rolls. All were delicious, I didn't even need to wasabi or soy sauce. My friends ordered the cheaper yakisoba and shrimp tempura lunches, which were ""quite good"" and ""great"" respectively. The tempura breading was also ""fabulous"" but the sauce that came with it too vinegary. All lunch specials came with miso soup and salad, which were not outstanding, but satisfying.

Two appetizers, yakitori and beef negimaki, were also enjoyed. Great char on the bottom of the negimaki, and the presentation was fun. We only received two skewers of yakitori, sadly, and had to divide them; the chicken was somewhat bland but the vegetables (green peppers, mushrooms, onions) made up for it.

After our food was finished, or packed up in doggy bags (stapled even! how nice of them) we were handed a complimentary plate of fried(?) breaded(?) banana drizzled in lime(?) green sauce. Well, whatever it was, I ate most of it. Beautiful texture and flavor, especially with their lovely whipped cream.

Even after all that, we ordered a dessert to share- they have quite the selection! Thus, the deliciously decadent chocolate truffle, sized somewhat like a tennis ball. Composed of gelato and cocoa dusting, among other things, and topped with more of that whipped cream and a cherry- mmmmm.

The café is moderately sized and fairly open, but it makes up for the open space by creating comfortable nooks and separate seating areas throughout the room. There are couches towards the street-side, booths and high tables near the middle, and high-backed chairs and coffee tables located in the direction of the rear.

It isn't just the coffee or the rustic atmosphere that makes Roast so fantastic, though. They've recently undergone a menu overhaul and, rather than just the usual cakes, pastries, and sweets, now offer breakfast and lunch options à la Chef Andrew Parker, which change daily.

And, yeah...they sell wine. It's always a tough decision for me once I reach the counter at Roast, since I love coffee and I adore wine. Roast's wine selection is fabulous because it serves up a variety of reds, whites, and rosés from across Canada, keeping it local and supporting wineries from the Okanagan and Niagara regions.

The café is also a great location for holding events (particularly literary/artsy ones) or hosting a meeting (they have a Community Room to accommodate them).

He wrote his name with (1 of the 3 available crayons) upside down & backwards towards him on the paper covering the table cloth, but easily readable for us. He introduced himself as he wrote it and asked what he could get us to drink. He quickly brought a warm loaf of fresh bread for us to tear apart and dredge in their delicious garlic and olive oil. 

We ordered Mozzarella caprese, warm spinach salad, and capellini pomodoro to split between the two of us. David brought out mozzarella frittas by mistake, but when we told him that wasn't what we ordered, he quickly apologized and offered to replace it with the mozzarella caprese. The frittas looked so good, we decided to keep them. They were delicious, lightly breaded with a tasty arrabbiata sauce. When the frittas were gone, I dipped the remainder of the bread in the extra sauce. 

The spinach salad was topped with creamy, toasted goat cheese that really added to the flavor of the spinach. Try to get a small bit of cheese in every bite. Supposed to have prosciutto, but there wasn't any? We don't care to eat the garlic slices, so picked them out, but loved the flavor they left behind, which blended perfectly with the lemon juice. The pomodoro provided a generous helping of tender capellini pasta covered with juicy, ripe grape tomatoes.

We spoke with the general manager as we were leaving and he stated that this was not an off day and people have been acting the same today as they have been for months. Didn't seem to really care that his employees are very rude to his customers and we will probably not go back because of this experience.",2014-11-17 22:17:01

The newly renovated building looks nice from the outside, but I feel like the prices do not match with their strange ambiance inside. For example, one side of the restaurant has nice looking tables. The other side of the restaurant uses these cheap, brown laminate tables. It's so weird! Maybe they can decor with some cloth tablecloths or something because honestly, it just feels so strange. Reminds me of eating at a cafeteria. 

The appetizers we ordered were seafood gumbo, chargrilled oysters,and their version of the bang bang shrimp. It was just average. Nothing too unique or special about it. The cheese used on the oysters tasted a little strange. Nothing a little salt could not fix. The shrimp was way too sweet for me. So beware, if you don't want diabetes! :P

The fried seafood platter was very good. It came with a softshell crab, oysters, shrimp and catfish with fries and hushpuppies.It was deifnitely big enough to split with 2-3 people. 

One of the other guests at the table ordered  a roast beef po-boy, but for some reason it was not on po boy bread. It seemed more like a fancy sandwich. The bf ordered the grilled Mahi-Mahi which was pretty good. Tasted very fresh. 

Overall worth a try, but skip if you are going on a fancy date unless you are going to be seated on the fancy side of the restaurant. :P Also, if you are eating in a group make sure to bring cash. They only accept two credit cards per table. Also, they charge 20% gratuity to groups of 5 or more.",2016-09-22 19:15:06

Gilley's is a huge antique mall just west of downtown Plainfield. It's a great place to find just about anything for a reasonable price. I've purchased several pieces of furniture from Gilley's, all for a much better deal than some other fun antique malls (Midland Antiques, I'm looking at you). 

On the one occasion I did ask them to come down on price (a mid-century modern bedroom suite), they had no problem immediately calling the vendor and speaking with her. I've also purchased pieces priced well below what they were going for on eBay, which is always exciting (though probably rare). 

So excited that you grabbed ten fragile items and you're trying to figure out how to properly juggle them in your tiny, T-Rex arms? Have no fear! A Gilley's employee is probably just around the corner to take your items off your hands and set them up front for you in a designated bin. 

It's even a fun place if you've got nothing to do on a Saturday and don't feel like spending any money. I'll continue to browse and furnish my little home with goods from Gilley's!",2014-07-18 11:24:42

Gilley's is huge, with a great selection of both antiques, vintage, & decorating items.  You could literally spend almost a whole day, aimlessly roaming up & down the aisles at Gilley's.  If you are going to visit, you want to set aside a minimum of an hour, and know that you still might not see everything.  We typically find 1-2 items each time we go, & could easily snag more.  Know that the majority of the items are sold in the ""booth"" set-up, where booth operators come in once a week or so to arrange/maintain their displays.  Therefore, there's not a lot of negotiation on price or anything here. The booth owners are typically not on-site, and you can't haggle. This isn't a flea market.  With that understanding, for the most part the booth owners set really fair prices on most items, and there are some serious deals to be found here.

There's not much to say really: it's exactly what you'd expect Bibimbap to be. The menu is small. It's basically Bibimbap and then Kimchi with some specials that change from time to time. The only negative, but not enough to take off a point, is that the portion sizes are quite small for what you pay. I always order extra meat and it still doesn't fill me up. I'm not even a big eater.

While my service was rude, my pizza tasted a day old and the place looks a little dirty despite it being renovated, I could tell the deep dish pizza was good. The guy before me ordered it and was raving about it, made me kinda jealous I didn't order the deep dish - I guess it must of been made fresh.

There's a few TVs for sports viewing, I think they serve beer and the pizza was pretty cheap.. 2-2.25$ per slice with taxes. I want to give it a 2 rating but this place has potential compared to most of the other non-chain pizza places..... Although I'd say Sbarro might be a step up.

I will never go back.

Firstly, the space is inconveniently laid out.   I had to go to three different stations to order what I wanted, and then go to yet a fourth station to pay.  Maybe it's possible to have some communication between the serving stations and the coffee bar, so I can order coffee from the food station, and go to the coffee station to pick it up, instead of having to wait in line again to order coffee?

But that is not the reason I will not go back.
The food I had was all very good, and it's a nice-looking, clean place.
The service, however, was the most insulting and rudest and hostile I've encountered in a long time.

Many of the items in the cold prepared food section were not labeled, so I told the man behind the counter that I was a vegetarian, and wanted to make up a plate of a few items that didn't have meat, eggs, seafood, etc.     I asked him what items were vegetarian, and he growled at me and said ""just tell me what you want"" in an incredibly rude and hostile manner.   I assumed, thusly, that he would steer me away from any items that weren't vegetarian.   I pointed to one item, and asked if if were vegetarian.  He said ""how much you want,"" hostile and rudely, like I was wasting his time.   I said a spoon.  He put a spoon's worth on the plate.  I pointed to another item, and asked ""how about that?"" and he said, again, ""just tell me what you want"" in such a hostile way, I was really taken aback.  He was surly and beyond rude.  He made no effort to mask a nasty and rude temperament. Every time I tried to confirm that an item was vegetarian, he would just say ""tell me how much you want."" I finally said to him that I thought he was being unnecessary hostile and rude and not helpful.    

I left it at that, and went to pay.  One bite into my dish, however, I tasted shrimp.  I went back to the counter, and asked him what the salad was. He said shrimp salad.  I  asked him why he would give me that after I repeatedly told him that I was a vegetarian, and he just glared at me.    

I asked to speak to the manager, who was the other man behind the food station.   I told the manager that his server was rude to me, and the manager said ""I don't think he was.""
WHAT?
I was stunned.  
You know what, Mr Manager? I don't care what you think.  Your job is customer service, and to find out why the customer felt he had a terrible experience.
Did you do that?
No. 
You immediately sided with the server, without having any idea what transpired between us.  The restaurant was noisy, the server's back was to the manager, and there is no way on earth that the manager could have heard what his server said to me, or the tone in which he said it. 
None.  
Yet, he sided with the server instead of finding out what happened?!?
He also did not offer to refund the cost of the shrimp salad that I asked him to remove from my plate.

Perhaps non-vegetarians might not empathize with my anger, or think I'm overreacting, but if you are a vegetarian of long standing and mistakenly eat meat because of someone else's incompetence and hostility, I think you will understand how angry I was.

I asked for the rude server's name, but the manager would not give it to me.  When he saw how angry I was, he finally tried to be friendly and very insincerely conciliatory,  but I told him it was too late.   He had a chance to find out what the problem was, but, instead, he quickly defended his worker and told me, essentially, that I was wrong.
The manager needs to learn to listen to all sides of a story, and to show some concern for a customer's complaints before telling the customer that he is wrong.  
When he finally wanted to listen, it was too little, too late.
And the server needs to understand that it is the customers' business that allows the corporation to pay his wages, and he best be polite to ensure that they come back.
I will not ever be treated that badly and rudely.

I recognize and can overlook that people are not always in the happiest mood, and I can overlook occasional surliness, but the manager's and the server's attitudes were both beyond the pale, and I can not condone a manager who told me that I was wrong, before he even knew what his server said and the manner in which he said it.

However, I'm always slightly annoyed when I leave here. I swear the selection of some products changes weekly. For example, I bought a fantastic vanilla almond milk here that had 5x the normal amount of protein. 1 week later when I returned to purchase the same thing it was nowhere to be found. Other times I came looking for some greek yogurt and was pretty disappointed with the selection, and noticed that the organization was pretty bad too. They had brands of cottage cheese that divided sections of yogurt. (a side note: they do stock kefir cultures [for now], which is a new favorite of mine)

Other items like fresh produce and nuts can be ridiculously expensive--watch out or you could end up paying more money here than at Whole Foods for lower quality ingredients (like an $8 tiny can of walnuts)!",2015-04-22 01:34:37

My brother and I were looking for a seafood place to take our elderly father. Doc Magrogans filled the bill. The hostess was quite accommodating and seated us at a table that both had plenty of room and was out of the main traffic pattern. 

Our waiter greeted us quickly, but there was an odd, lengthy lull between every part of our order, Just getting glasses of water took a while.

The food, when it arrived was good. An assortment of chowders was good - the yellow squash bisque was the best. Fried calamari was crisp, and the sauce had good heat to it. My Dad's filet, was, well, a filet - neither good nor bad. My brothers bouillabaisse was more a hearty fish stew over pasta, but it was still good. My swordfish was fine.

I had the ""Chicken Portobello"" which was a huge portion that was plated over a very ample bed of ""orzo with spinach & vegetables"".  The flavors of this dish were quite impressive, not too salty as with most chain restaurants.  Only $13.99.....well worth the price due to the unlimited fresh baked bread that was delivered piping hot to our table.

Daughter had one of those Bowtie pasta dishes with chicken....it looked a lot like the dish she orders at the Cheesecake Factory.  She devoured every drop on the plate.

Wifey ordered the salmon ""low calorie"" plate, which consisted of baked salmon and fresh vegetables.  She seemed very pleased.

They are offering a special ""extra"" where you can get your choice of Appetizer and choice of dessert for only $5.99 extra. (a $13.50 value based on the individual prices of the crab-stuffed mushrooms and the smothered chocolate cake, which we all shared).

The total bill, including the tip, was under $55.  We were completely satisfied with both the food quality and service from Tyler, our young waiter.

As chain restaurants go, you could do a LOT worse than Romano's.

Due to the competition with the nearby BUFFETs at the casinos and hotels, THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION must try harder in order to lure the Reno tourists away from the cheap buffet deals that proliferate in Nevada.

Anyway I got the Steak salad (med. rare...just the way I like it) with a cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing. For the most part it was really good, I just wish it had a little sweetness to it, just to counter all of the savory flavors of the steak. My associate ordered the meatloaf with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf looks like a steak. It's baked and grilled, however it is shaped like a steak. He said it was good. I didn't want to eat too much it was getting late. I contemplated on a dessert which was a bread pudding and some sort of brownie with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and a whole bunch of fixings...it sounded really good, I just think I was in the mood for something that heavy right before a movie. Overall it was a pretty good experience. Next time I go, I have to try their wings...from what I hear, everyone says they are really good.

Located two doors down from great fermentations, they offer a good selection of small batch beers.

Their tiny batches allow them to have a little more fun with the beer. Just because you've had a beer (example: cream ale) somewhere else, doesn't mean it will be the same here. 

Their tasting line changes weekly, and upcoming beers are listed at the left of the board. They have handy little flashcards about their beers on the counter, so if they are busy enough that you don't get a full explanation form the brewer, you can still learn about the beer from the card. 

They have a big, inviting tap room and seem to be more focused on making sure you get to try the beer and learn about what you are drinking rather than getting as many people through as they can. That's not to say that you will be left waiting in line for a taste. Everyone seems to get plenty of attention and if you wait for a taste at all, it won't be a long wait.",2011-10-03 14:51:22

Multiple friends have requested them as gifts. I saw Darth Vader, Boba Fett, Chewbacca, and a Storm Trooper, available in silver or gold tone. 

Eh...I kinda thought the higher prices would be because the products were made in the USA. Many of the items I saw were made in China, but some are USA made...just not all. Definitely unique clothing, many Indiana-centric Ts, but not much that a corporate man could wear to work. Maybe perfect for a graphic designer or small-shop web developer, a photographer...someone in an artistic profession...but if you're an exec you may not find suitable pieces here. 

Grooming and ""gift"" stuff is also in stock. 

You can definitely tell the owner has stocked this store with things that fit his own sense of style. I hope the business makes it but I think it needs to appeal to a wider audience. I'm not saying ""be generic,"" I'm just saying stock clothing that isn't just for hipsters. When a shirt has a $100 price tag, it probably needs to be suitable for someone who can afford it. Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way, but paying $100 for a shirt ""made in China"" (like everything at Old Navy) doesn't sit well with me.

One evening I waited at the host stand for my food, and the young man acting as hostess made personal phone calls on his cell phone (presumably to his girlfriend) while dropping the F bomb repeatedly.

Ordered three pieces of sushi.  They were some of the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had. The salmon was not fresh.  The hamachi was boring.  The striped bass, which was the cheapest of the sushis, was actually the most flavorful. 

A crisp Riesling is usually a good accompaniment to sushi.  Unfortunately, there is not one on the menu.  The one they had was cloyingly sweet, with no acid or fruit.  It wasn't even finished!  The pinot noir was too earthy.  The cava, while not great, was the best of the options.

The pajeon was smaller than I imagined, but delicious and surprisingly filling - certainly enough to hold you over until the main dish. I love traditional bibimbap, and BAP does it SO SO well. I always get the classic marinated beef as my protein, and this particular version comes with soybean, carrots, cucumbers, mushroom, cabbage, a gooey egg, and broccoli!

Theirs is mixed with ricotta, at least for the eggplant parmigiana. Maybe that's cheating to slip cheese in there but it is a real treat to find good sauce in an Italian restaurant in tampa. 

We ordered the eggplant parmigiana and two pizzas. One gardinia pizza with eggplant,  zucchini and other vegetables. And a classic margherita pizza as we wanted a point to compare to the other places we've tried. 

The pizza is good. Three stars. The toppings were good. Mine came out a bit too cool but my husbands pizza was piping. My mother loved the pizza. The crust can be better but it is good pizza for the average person (I'm admittedly a  pizza snob). 

The eggplant parmigiana was 4 stars. Very good. A delight!  Eggplant very tasty. My husband thought it was too mushy but I liked it. The cannoli's were very good. The filling was a little thin for me but good flavor. Apparently they have tiramisu too. 



The service is out of this world. Sam greeted us at the door and was very friendly. Heather our waitress was on top of all concerns. A young man came out to serve the pizza and he was laughing and joking with us 

The music there is soooo amazing!!!  I was rocking out to bon jovi and Michael Jackson. 

The place is huge. Lots of money put into that place. They need to market more to get it packed. No one was hardly there.

I ordered the Ghost Pepper wings after being informed by the waitress that they were ""really hot,"" but they were nothing of the sort.

#1 - ordered a cheese steak - you were out of Kaiser  rolls, not the end of the world but you were also out a cheese that a gentleman ordered on his salad and some thing else the lady behind me ordered
#2 after looking around at other dining options I came back and ordered a roast beef sandwich...2 workers were in the back for minutes...when some one 
finally came out she made my sandwich and gave it t the wrong person...I said to the employee I thin you just gave my sandwich to someone else...she said ""it's dirty back here I don't know what ticket that was"". So she reluctantly and made my sandwich and the kicker to this evening was she almost threw the sandwich at me and said 'here you go"" as if she was bothered by the fact that I ordered food from your establishment. 

I was absolutely disgusted at the fact that you were nearly out of everything then after I came back I was treated as if your company did me a favor after screwing up the order then finally making the sandwich...by the way it wasn't all that great.

but please don't take my word...I encourage you to talk to the manger on duty because the young lady who made my sandwich has no business working in front of customers.

Decor only goes so far though, if you come to a place that says it is an ice cream fountain you better have the goods to back it up. I got the pistachio and peanut butter in a cone. My friend for nutter butter and the raspberry cheesecake. My peanut butter scoop was a little too thick, it was really like frozen peanut butter, delicious but really heavy. However, my pistachio was dead on though I thought it was flavorful but still light.

I tried the butter butter and it was what I was looking for in the peanut butter flavor. After reading the reviews and finding it's one of their homemade flavors I know why it was so good. The raspberry cheesecake also stood out and was jealous of the choice she made.

* High quality and consistency (gotta have this, of course).

* Distinctive house style. Bier beer is instantly recognizable. Their beer has a very fresh, lucid, clear, clean taste with all of the flavors distinct. Good balance, and the flavors pop in a certain way that is hard to describe. Try it and you'll see what I mean.

* A solid niche. Although Bier can do hoppy very well (their PDG pale ale is distinctive and a real favorite), that's not their focus. They do lagers, wheat beers, and less-hoppy ales with great skill, and they make them exciting and interesting as well. Yesterday I sampled their International Exchange lager and Good Pils (humble name, this!), and both were subtly incredible.

Beyond the beer, there are some other great reasons to visit:

* Friendly staff with a great vibe. They clearly are enjoying their work and are fans of their own brewery.

* Great, comfortable space. It's inviting and easygoing.

* Dogs welcome inside!

* They don't do flights, but you can sample all of the beers at the counter.

* Lots of live music and activities.

If you are a beer nut, Bier definitely belongs high on your list to try. If you are looking for a good place to hang out with friends and have a sip of brew that will please connoisseurs and average drinkers alike, I do believe you will be pleased.",2017-04-12 21:12:56

I don't get many chances to wake up on a Sunday to gorgeous weather and be able to casually enjoy a small morning snack but for the first time in a long time, I was finally able to do this! No better time spent than at Helena Avenue Bakery. The only way I can describe the vibe here is modern rustic with a cute outdoor seating area that's shaded with umbrellas. A small part of me was making comparisons between this place and Republique in LA which is a huge compliment given all the great things about Republique! The scale of their menu and baked goods are much smaller though but the vibe here still somehow reminds me of Republique. I chose three items to share between 2 people. 
-Matcha Latte - fairly standard, price about what I expect for the size, would recommend getting a hot one
-Blueberry and Lemon scone - I'm not typically a scone persony but I really wanted to try this one out. I wasn't disappointed! Lots of blueberry with a lemony glaze. The scone was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.
-Peanut and cashew butter with Banana toast - Hands down one of the best nut butter mix spreads I've ever had spread thickly over perfectly toasted sourdough bread. I wonder if they make it in house or if it's bought from somewhere because....I need more of this! The thinly sliced banana pieces cover the entire toast topped with bits of rosemary which just adds that extra flavor kick. As easy as it sounds like it is to make this at home, enjoying the toast here was pretty darn delicious.

Asked for a medium rare brunch burger, received a well done burger with burnt bacon and 4 bite sized bits of potato with an awkward arrangement of grapes and strawberries. I took a couple bites hoping the burger would be more red and put it down on my plate. My boyfriend ordered their crabcake eggs benedict which came with fully poached eggs (no runny yolk), cold crabcakes, and dried out asparagus. We're not picky people and we never send food back to the kitchen, ever.

The manager came around and we both hesitated when she asked us how everything was. We explained what happened with our order and it was clear we hadn't eaten much of our brunch. Without even blinking she said she would replace our meal and that it would be comped. I've never seen such instant customer service. The food that replaced our original dish was night and day, it was like different people had cooked it.

I'm not jumping this to a 4 star because even though the replacement food we received was exceptionally better, it was still just mediocre food.

With the wall facing the street being all windows, the inside was flooded with natural light. They had a quite large sushi and bar counter in the middle, with seating all around it. They also had small two-person booth seating on the side as well. Very clean decor, I am glad they didn't put up any kind of cheap or fake Asian ""artworks"" on the wall.

We ordered an appetizer and side dish to go with our sushi rolls. We chose Creamy Rock Shrimp, Lobster Fried Rice, Sindy Roll and Old City Roll. All in all, they were all very tasty, high quality and we enjoyed them very much. Yes, everything was perfect until we ordered some desserts... 

Since they didn't have a dessert menu, we ordered Tree Cake and Green Tea Cheesecake based on the description of the dessert that our waitress gave us. 

This so-called Tree Cake...I call it ""rip-off"" cake. Our waitress described it as a cake made with almond, egg and butter. When it came out, I was shocked what it really was... If you are familiar with a common and popular sweets in Japan, one of them is called Baumkuchen which is actually a German layered cake. They can be purchased from most bakeries and stores, and not so pricey unless you go to some fancy boutique to get it. The cake we were presented with, in my opinion, was store-bought, and sliced as thinly as possible. For $10, you can buy an entire cake!!! Very disappointing... And on top of that, it was dry (with these thin slices being cut off from the cake, I wonder how long it has been since the cake was first purchased?). And if that is not enough, we were given spoons to eat this...why? I don't know...

Our waitress was very friendly and polite, and we were well taken care of. Everything we had, other than the Tree Cake was great. High quality and tasty, a bit on pricey side, but that comes with the quality. I wish if we made a different choice with the dessert. But then, you live and you learn.

Mike's is a small ice cream parlor, one that barely fits the patrons and its popularity. There is some effort that went into decorating this place like an old school ice cream parlor, with it's small tables and chairs, counter tops, and unique wall décor. 

Mike serves a wide selection of handmade ice cream in a variety of different ways and they are extremely generous on their scoops. Between the two of us, we shared a single scoop of pralines and cream on a waffle cone and it was almost too much--and we're both like our ice cream! The ice cream is very creamy and incredibly delicious. In this particular flavor, there were generous amounts of praline--a few in every bite, and lots of caramel swirls. Our ice cream was truly divine and it seems like everyone else's ice cream was also delicious as no one could make it to the register without first taking a bite!

This turned out to  a huge disappointment on several levels -

We  went for lunch  the restaurant  was  basically  empty at 1:45 when we  arrived - 
the service  was  terrible - 
We were presented with the dinner menu  and when we asked for the lunch menu were told  this was all there was...

Once the  order was placed, the waiter parked himself  by the cooking line  & never came back, so we had to ask the bus boy for the Focaccia bread. The waiter then brought  everything  directly after the bread arrived, therefore we didn't have time to enjoy the bread, which  we  normally  devour as soon as it is put in front of us. Then had  to again wait for someone to come back so we could  ask  for balsamic vinegar to  add to the dipping olive oil.

My mom ordered:
Calamari Fritti crisp-fried, pepperoncini, arrabbiata 10
& house salad

The birthday girl ordered:
Bellini Cipriani - la marca prosecco, white peach purée 7

and we shared

Italian for Two @ $25.00

Tappas - Zucchini Fritti
 
Eggplant Quadratini
roasted eggplant, basil, tomato, ricotta salata, red chile 13.5

Chicken Milanese (add $3.00)
arugula Parmesan salad, roasted potatoes,  lemon butter

ok the -   Bellini  in a  tulip glass - lovely  but  $7.00??
The  Calamari was  a disappointment -  pale & - not  crispy  as  advertised-  the  house salad was  good.
Zucchini Fritti -  my daughter & I  each ordered one,  which for a change  was a mistake because one would have been enough for 3,  it was good but... not as good  as it looked on the menu or  I had hoped -  the "" ribbons"" were  not  long ribbons  instead they were small  pieces and a little greasy - should have  ordered only one of these and a different 2nd  tappas...
The Chicken Milanese was  pounded so thin  that it was  dried out &  had  no flavor -  the coating  was thicker than the chicken& the sauce  over top was  almost  non existent  - the arugula salad  had  absolutely no  taste what so ever,  the potatoes were plentiful, cooked  correctly &  had   loads of roasted garlic  which I did  love -

The eggplant quadratini was good going down, not so  much  later that evening when my daughter became ill and eventually  threw up after being miserable for several hours ... therefore she never touched the  leftovers...

The  ambiance we had always loved  in the  dining room  was  gone -  the music was no longer classic Italian music, the beautiful white gladiolas  were gone and  the happy birthday song which the waiters sing  in Italian never even happened - 
The hostess never looked up from the stand  to say goodbye -


Total for lunch for 3 guests including tip  almost  $70.00

Went on a busy Saturday night. After missing our reservation due to traffic, the hostess helped us to get seated right away. That was awesome. The restaurant is beautiful. We were told that the menu was new this weekend. Everything looked good, so maybe the menu is a bit too big, but that's not really a problem. After looking over the menu for a few minutes, the waitress came over to give us a ""tour"" of the menu. Dear Doc M's: This is not people's first time eating in a restaurant. No one needs a tour of the menu.

Ordered some oysters, which were FANTASTIC! Loved the Shooting Points-had never tried those before. Then the waitress came back to give us a tour of the menu (yes-another one). Remember, by this point, we had had menus for almost 20 minutes. We cut her off and told her we were ready to order. It took about 25 minutes for apps to come out. The clam chowder, a special this month, had a great flavor profile, but was definitely too thick, and for a $9 caesar salad, it was way too small. Entrees were very good, but definitely on the small side. Lobster roll was NOT served on buttered brioche, but instead on a small hoagie roll with bland fries. Grilled and blackened swordfish were both delicious. 

In the future, I think we would definitely go back, because the food was very good. But, you might be better off just getting a bunch of appetizers and items from the raw bar considering the size of the entrees. I hope they do away with the menu tours, and the coupons at the end offering free appetizers. That's cheesy.",2013-02-10 19:10:22

I had our server touch the fettuccini with his finger to verify and he concurred that the noodles were refrigerator cold. He then took my plate and must have placed it in he oven and yes it came back hot, but the bottom of the lasagne was burnt and stuck to the plate, I couldn't scrape it off to eat it. Not to mention that he price of $19 was way too much for the small portions without a salad. We were one of only four tables in the restaurant and not once did my tea get refilled. My husbands tea sat empty at the edge of the table for quite some time and was refilled as we were paying our bill. My husband had the chicken scallopini--the exact same item he has had for years and obviously the recipe has changed...for the worse. There was no sear in the chicken, it tasted boiled. The cheeses for the first time tasted like velveeta, not the original butter and cream recipe.  The kids each had spaghetti and meatballs and no thank you, we don't want to mix those leftovers to take home.

1. first and foremost the food has to be not just great, but great every time. Check!
2. Price - on par with the competition and even a little higher if its really good. Check!
3. Service - be happy to see me & take my Order; if anything goes wrong or it takes longer then normal - come to me with real empathy and offer apologies and to fix what ever is a-rye. Wow, although really rare - they are experts at caring about you and your meal. Check!

The icing on top of all of this - The Owner is there a lot of the time, the employees have been there for years and years and are happily working where you can watch them = more proof of excellent management - very little turnover, happy workers. 

If an eatery has great food and great service but the price is way over the top no one goes frequently. If you have great prices and great service, but the food sucks - no one goes more then once. Finally if you have great food and great prices but the people there are rude, nasty with poor service never fixing mistakes without an argument - no one goes back.
All 3 categories must always be excellent to get 5 Stars

So the secret to Ardmore Pizza is they are exemplary in all 3 categories all the time - very rare indeed.

Wish they had a sit-down restaurant - oops but then they would need exemplary waiter/waitress staff and a floor manager, dishwashers and so forth - Maybe not, its fine that Ardmore Pizza is known as  The 5 Star Takeout Pizza (and more) eatery of the Main Line.

Cheeseburgers and Parasites 


Actually it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't great either. The problem for me, was that if a particular food item is displayed in your restraunts name, it better be damn good. These burgers weren't paradise, they were simply average. They have some decent burger toppings ( I myself got a bleu cheese and onion straw burger, which was decent but not wow) but I was surprised to see that the CheeseBurger in Paradise burger was simply a cheeseburger...served with a pickle. 
To go along with that, the fries were blah, McDonald's shoestring sized yet not even as crispy, laying somewhat limp on the plate. I prefer steak fries, I like girth ( ...that's what she said!) 

Upon being sat, the song "" Cheeseburger in Paradise"" by Jimmy Buffett, was playing over their stereo system. I had a brief but rational worry that this song would be played on a loop as I ate. Thankfully, it wasn't nor were we subjected to JBs entire catalog but the CIP song was peppered liberally in the song rotation , so that we heard it at least 3 times while dining. 

The tikibar decor was cool but not terribly impressive. The service was very good, although it was pretty dead even for a Monday night. My son loved the paper umbrella that came with his kids drink and I could tell that his older sister, who proudly orders drinks and entrees off the regular menu, was seething in jealousy yet too proud with her ""adult"" status to ask for one.. 

I didn't use the facilities but both offspring reported that they were ""freaked out"" by the peeping fish placed strategically in the bathrooms. We didn't get dessert but their Chocolate Nachos sounded intriguing , until I saw the faces of a couple nearby, who got the dish. It didn't look pretty. 

Overall, it was an average experience. I would not go out of my way to either return to CIP or to avoid it. When there are so many places to choose from, CIP needs to distinguish itself from all the other restraunt chains. My advice would be to ""beef"" up those titular average burgers and to get those rude fish out of the bathrooms, that like to watch people make toilet.",2009-08-19 18:25:47

There is a Starbucks here, of course. (Do they even allow Barnes & Nobles to exists without coffee shops anymore -- I mean, really?)

My boyfriend asked the waiter if he had a glass like he drew, and he obviously got upset and flustered saying they always serve house wine in a mug. 

I understand its traditional to serve it in a glass, in Italy, but if you know anything about wine, red optimal flavors are represented in 60-65F degrees, white a bit colder 50-55F degrees. If in the least they should give the option to customers of traditional customs or in a stem glass which they have, instead of serving in a hot glass ruining the flavor and raising the temperature to 80+F degrees.

I called around to comparison shop based on Yelp reviews. Ultimately I landed on AM/PM based on the reviews and the general confidence I had in them after a brief call. Shuy showed up on time and was great. He was honest about what needed to be done, worked with me on the price (there were 9 locks), gave me good advice, and didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. The work was done pretty quickly, he answered all my questions, and was really accommodating when I wanted to modify something after the work had been done. He also was diligent about cleaning things up after the work was done. 

Great experience and will definitely hang onto his number and refer him to others. You can't go wrong with them. 

Thanks Shuy!",2015-10-14 13:45:53

I value the friendships I've made and the convenience of location. 

Fast forward May 12th. I approached Kenny today. Keep in mind, I workout regularly and not once has he mentioned our conversation or even greeted me.  I asked him the status of the classes and he alleged the pregnant instructor, (I'm going to assume it's Amanda) is on maternity leave and they can't fill the position. I commented that I've joined LA Fitness and it's cheaper than my Gold's membership and it includes 15+ classes a week. Another great thing about their classes is that 3 of the instructors I've had so far are former instructors at Gold's. Kenny shrugged his shoulders and said ok.

A couple of things that did not wow me as noted below but overall I thought this place was top notch. Atmosphere was lovely and our service was mostly excellent.

Wok Kampachi Ceviche app: Delicious! Sweet, savory, umami yumminess.
Tuna tartare app: This was the only dish that I would not order again. The tuna was super fresh but it came too cold and bland. If you are hoping for something akin to the tuna tartare at Morimoto's, this is not it.
Lychee martini- The first one I had was very sweet without enough tang. The second one was better. I would order again. I would suggest that the bar get some fresh lychee to garnish the drink in the future. My first came with flower petals, my second came with a dried orange slice.

Rolls:
Sindy: Excellent! Favorite roll of the night. I had never had a roll without rice before and I'm a convert. Everything was fresh and presented just right. No weird temperature issues with the crispy eel. I'm coming back to this place because of this roll.
Dynamite White Tuna - Best spicy tuna I've had.
Dragon roll - this is a standard sushi offering. Getting it here will make you happy. Quality ingredients, perfect combo.
Peppered tuna - the most understated of the rolls we had. Kind of like a tuna salad flavor. I liked the daikon. You might want to start instead of end with this roll. It did not wow me after the others I had with the bold flavors.

Small issue- No soy sauce on our table so we had to grab one from a neighboring table.

This is likely due to the labour shortage in our city. They are open quite late, generally until 2am.

When you walk in, the first thing you see is an impressive bar - mainly serving coffee and dessert items. There are bar stools all along it and a copy of each local newspaper.

There are a total of nine computers available, I think I counted two or three Macs, the rest PCs. The rates are reasonable.

At the back was a stage with a drum kit and keyboard on it. It seems they have some live music on occasion. In front of the stage was a large square coffee table with some magazines scattered on it surrounded by some deflated-looking leather couches. Along the opposite wall, which was interesting exposed brick, was a chess table set up and ready to go with a pair of well worn and torn leather chairs.

There was interesting art hanging on all the walls. 

The bathroom was unimpressive. There were two stalls - one without a lock. There was an almost finished roll of toilet paper on the back of one of the toilets and that's it. There was a lot of writing all over the walls inside the stalls. No swearing or anything, some almost thoughtful ponderings and a commentary about Harry Potter.

During CMA Fest when we went, this place was lined up out the door almost constantly. I'm sure it's not like that all the time, but even if it is, it's worth the wait.

The ice cream tastes super fresh and there are some really unique flavors to choose from. I got a double scoop - Tennessee fudge and Take That! Both were delicious; TT had what I identified as Whoppers in it, while Tennessee fudge is pretty self-explanatory. I preferred the Tennessee fudge, however.

During peak times, Mike's definitely ups the ante and has tons of people scooping and working the cash, which makes even the longest lines fly. A must-try if it's a hot day in downtown Nashville!",2013-06-30 20:28:55

We waited but noticed no one was around to receive us. So after looking around and finding no wait staff, we decided to go seat ourselves. After about 3 minutes we were greeted by a waitress. 

The restrooms were not clean. This should've been the first red flag. The doors, light switches and anywhere people touch were caked with dark brown grease/dirt and there were no paper towels available either. This made me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen. 

My wife ordered the cashew chicken and the Mongolian beef for me. The mongo beef was good with green and white onions and a good sauce. The cashew chicken looked and tasted bad. The veggies appeared to have been canned and the the sauce was milky white colored. The chicken was breaded and soggy. Definitely stay away from their cashew/almond chicken if you decide to come here. 

The egg rolls that came with the lunch special were freshly made but a little hard and weird tasting. The fried rice was good. The service was okay. The wait staff was friendly but not very interested in checking up on us. Had to wave them down for things.

The atmosphere here is laid back and friendly, the bier talk is great and the people pouring the bier are also those who make it, so ask questions.
Comfy sofas are available to relax in, and vinyl records are abundant, just pick what you would like to hear and pop it on the record player! I really like that touch! This is a dog friendly place and the sweet mascot will greet you when you walk in.

You can't beat a cheap meal, and especially one that's prepared with obviously fresh vegetables! My husband picked up our dinner right before I got off from work, but it's so cold outside we had to reheat them - thankfully the microwave didn't ruin anything. He got the beef and I opted just for the vegetables, both of which came with an egg. The variety of veggies is great, but most importantly they are clearly fresh, not frozen or canned, and it makes a huge difference with bibimbap. The sauces were good, but I felt like the veggie one lacked a little bit on flavors. Spicy level was minimal when you mixed everything together, so I ended up adding more for myself.

My drink was so perfectly blended - the best I have ever had. If I can taste the coffee then I am not a fan. From start to finish it tasted amazing. I was quite sad that I only got a small. I was able to try the frozen cappuccino as well. It was great. Better than a Frappuccino - and what I ended up getting when we revisited a few hours later.

Pathmark is DIRT CHEAP, has a huge selection, and tons of free parking.

Lack of giving a crap about their patrons? Who knows. So I went there with my wife this past Monday night and our waitress was definitely not on point. Right out of the gate she asks us about our time constraints, and it was about 5:30 P.M. Now I can understand this logic if it were lunch time or earlier in the day, but that is literally the first time any waiter or waitress has ever asked me this at this time of the day. I hardly get asked this to begin with.

Not that it mattered, even if we were on a time constraint, we sure as hell weren't going anywhere fast, because ""prompt service"" was clearly not in her vocabulary. My wife ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and I got a Soda and Salad to start off with. I get my drink and Salad within 5 minutes... Still no wine for my wife. She's going around attending to some of the other folks, then mentions that ""the wine is on the way."" It's one glass of wine - what the hell? I didn't ask for a bottle of vintage wine from the Manager's personal stock at his house. 10 minutes later the wine gets there. My wife doesn't want to spoil the mood so I don't say anything, but I'm very visibly irritated and it's obvious at this point.

We had ordered around the time I got my salad, and come to find out now also, what my wife ordered she is just now finding out that they are ""out of"" for the night. Wonderful. So my food is almost ready at this point and my wife is having to re-order now. No offer to comp, no offer for complimentary dessert, nothing but pure apathy. Some of these waitresses and waiters wonder why people get crappy? Interesting.

We end up getting our food - I got the Chicken Marsala and my wife did a build your own spaghetti. My food went from pretty ""meh"" to kicking my ass afterward - it wasn't spicy at all yet it felt like fire coming out.

I won't go on and on beyond this because I don't have much else nice to say. I'm very disappointed with Macaroni Grill and their staff. I usually get better than this and they really flopped hard this time. I might give them one more chance... we'll see.",2014-08-30 19:20:23

I keep trying to catch them straight out of the oven, but I think you probably have to ask them for that or something, because the last time I watched them bring out a fresh batch of egg tarts, and ordered it, it was still cold. Definitely still, good, I just want to try them right when they come out of the oven. I wish I knew when they baked those darn egg tarts. I'll have to ask them next time. Anyways, unlike most of the places in Chinatown, they use a flaky crust for their egg tarts. Pair that with the sweet, creamy baked egg custard filling, and it is a match made in heaven haha. Flaky crusts are the way to go for egg tarts. 

Their other buns and savory pastries are standard; taste the same to me anywhere I get them. My sister favors their butter bread though, which is very good, and can act as dinner rolls. The drinks here are ok, nothing special. They serve the standard milk tea, lemon tea, and they also have bubble tea, but I've never gotten that here. They have a few small tables for you to sit on, and a refrigerator with soda and canned/boxed drinks right by the door so you can grab and go(no five finger discount!!! Remember to pay). I've also had the lemon cake before, which wasn't bad, but sometimes I do stray from the cakes, as they don't always look fresh.

I don't think I've ever seen young people working here; it's usually 1 or 2 middle aged ladies behind the counter. They're not mean, but they're not overly friendly either. They just do their job, that's all it is. No extra smiles or small chat. And usually, there will be one or two middle aged/old men sitting toward the back reading the newspaper, making it seem more like the cafes in HK, where old people will hang out in cafes just to drink a cup of tea and pass the hours by.

I thought the brussel sprouts were really good, it had an asian style to it, probably from the sesame oil/seeds. The tuna tatare was served over a crispy thin cracker, which balanced out the creamy avocado and tuna. The mai fried rice was decent, just fried rice.

For rolls, we ordered the peppered tuna, white tuna, and J&J. Though the specialty roll (J&J) was almost double the price of the regular roll, there was definitely more going on and it was a lot more filling. I'd recommend getting at least one specialty roll.

In a city that is flooded with breweries trying to make their mark, I can always count on a Bier brew to be delicious.  As much as I enjoy downing a pint (or three) of their sudsy goodness at a local bar, it surprises me that it took me so long to make my way to their Tap Room.  Honestly I only stopped by because I was making a trip to their neighbor Great Fermentations and decided to head inside on a recent Friday night.

Their tap room is set up for groups of nearly any reasonable size.  Couples will find seating as easily as groups of 8.  They have several tables with mismatched chairs and couches.  In the corner they even have a spot for some live music which we got to enjoy during our visit.  

Head to the back right corner and tell the workers if you've never been, because they will be happy to help you sample and select a good brew.  Beers are served in plastic cups, which I think could definitely be upgraded at some point since it felt a little cheap to me (but hey, no dishes to wash!).  Follow the staff recommendations, because they want to make you happy and provide you with something new!

All in all I have to say that I would come back again!  One thing that was a tad disappointing is the turnaround time for a keg.  There are some places in Indy that can have kegs waiting and can provide them the same day you call, but Bier asked for 48 hours to fill an order.  We decided to go elsewhere simply because they could fill our order faster.",2016-01-22 20:44:56

Even my husband, who pours salt on everything, said it was so salty he didn't have to put salt on there. Which is ok for him but for normal people it was too much.

Cons: Customer service here sucks! I work in the hospitality industry so i can understand if workers are tired and not being peppy at all times. But the guys that work here make it seem like you are a nuisance by just walking in. I went in about a week ago with my dad and 3 sisters. When we walked up to the counter, no one greeted us but just stood there and stared. we told one of the guys to give us a second to look over the menu. So after a couple of minutes i place my order and he abruptly walks away before my little sister can tell him hers. Makes my coffee and walks over to the register and waits for me to pay. So i told him my sister would like a mango juice and he ROLLS his eyes at his coworker and walks off pissed. He makes the smoothly with a bunch of banging and literally tosses it across the counter and walks off. He then asks another worker to check us out. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! she is only 12 and i can tell see how surprised she looked at the way he was acting. The funny thing is, every person after us got a hello and a way better treatment. She even asked if it was because we were the only black people in the store. Do you know how hurtful it is trying to come up with a reason why we were being treated different than the other people at the store? We ended up leaving a 20% gratuity for the other guy that checked us out because he was at least patient. I hope that redheaded cashier reads this and fixes his attitude.

My family and I used to go here pretty much exclusively for our special occasion meals, and it's a great place for dates; in fact, you'll probably see a good number of high school students there around homecoming and prom, since Alton High and Marquette Catholic are close by. So it's a busy place, especially on weekends, but I've never had to wait very long for a table - plus, since it's a small town, chances are you'll run into someone you know, and the wait won't seem as long either way. 

I can't speak to their whole menu, as I only ever ordered two items when dining there: the toasted ravioli, and the peppercorn steak. Now, toasted ravioli is touted as a St. Louis original, and indeed it's something I've yet to find outside of that little circle of the Midwest. It's not very fancy, but it *is* good: well-seasoned beef ravioli, breaded and fried, with marinara sauce on the side for dip. It's technically an appetizer, but I'm one of those people who eat lots of little meals, so it was always enough for me. 

The peppercorn steak, on the other hand, is where this place really shines. A tender filet mignon, perfectly seasoned and served medium rare with a hint of butter and herb - this is the steak that got me into eating steak. It practically melts on your tongue, try though you might to savour every last ounce of flavour. 

I wanted to give this place five stars, since relative to the other options in Alton, it definitely deserves them. I'm still convinced that the steak alone is worth five stars. I only gave it four, though, because as much as I love this place, there *is* better food out there. (Just not in Alton.)",2008-07-10 03:10:58

Mike's Ice Cream is far and away one of our favorite places in Nashville.  Both my husband and I absolutely adore this tiny little ice cream shop in downtown Nashville and make a point to visit anytime we're downtown - no matter how full we may be from our dinner or honky-tonk fun (somehow, there's always room for ice cream).  The homemade ice cream, in fun and delicious flavors, gets us every single time.  We love Mike's Ice Cream so much that we even bought 2 giant containers to serve to our guests at our wedding rehearsal dinner - and it was a huge hit!  Even the small container of mixed berry sorbet we bought for our dairy-free guests was quickly gobbled up and thoroughly enjoyed.

We love most of the flavors at Mike's, but there are a few that make the list of our ""most-favoritist ice creams of all time"".  Those flavors include:

-Take That (seriously, too delicious for words)
-Loaded Butterscotch
-Toasted Coconut
-Peanut Butter Cup
-Red Velvet

I once heard about a flavor where they take something like 6 different kinds of cake and blend them into vanilla ice cream.  I have not yet seen or tasted this flavor, but I do, on occasion, dream about it...

The only downside to Mike's is that the location makes it impossible to just stop in for an ice cream cone.  It's impossible to park on the street or anywhere close to Mike's without paying big bucks.  We're fine with saving our visits for when we're already downtown anyway, but it'd be nice to be able to stop by whenever the ice cream craving hits.

Everytime I visit my grandma, we try to go here, but I think yesterday was our last visit. (The previous time we visited, we walked out because our food took over an hour and my 4 year old was freaking out.)

My grandma had some coupons for their new ""$7 meal in 7 minutes or it's free"" so we each ordered two lunches at the counter. After about 15 minutes, we are still waiting for our food. All the employees keep looking at us nervously because they know it's been longer than 7 minutes. 

The lady who rang us up briefly says something to the head honcho chef looking man and then brings our food to us. I tell her she knows it's been twice the amount of time promised and that we want our food for free as advertised. Now, if it had only been a few minutes longer, I wouldn't have made a big deal. But it took TWICE as long. She immediately says, ""you only get it free if you are dining it. It doesn't count for to go orders."" No. I can tell right off the bat that's a load of crap so we ask to speak to the chef boss man. 

Here is a whole new problem. This man walks up to me and my 70 year old grandmother and says, ""Hi girls, what's going on?"" GIRLS? Really? What a patronizing prick. Don't you dare address my 70 year old grandmother as ""girl."" UGH. Anyways, he claims that corporate told them it doesn't count on carry out orders. I tell him to show me that on any one of their numerous advertisements. He can't because obviously he's lying. He just doesn't want to get dinged for being so slow. He says, ""Alright girls, I'll take care of it for you this time, but those are the rules."" Great, take care of it asshole. 

So while we are waiting for a refund, I look up this 7 minute express lunch deal on my phone and find that it is indeed for dine in OR carry out. I show it to him and he is immediately red faced claiming he had no idea.

From the time I started wedding planning I knew music would be important and so I didn't want to wait too long before hiring a DJ. I went to a few wedding shows and at all 3 of them I had positive interactions with the guys from TKO! At the last wedding show I went to I put my name in for a drawing and to my surprise I actually won! The ""prize"" was $100 off DJ service! It was meant to be. My fiance and I scheduled a meeting with Chris from TKO and he walked us through the process and contract. We were delighted to work with him since he was super friendly. I asked about up-lighting and he said they would even be able to provide the lights as well. It was done deal. After we signed the contract Chris sent me a link so that we could go into their site and start creating our playlist. We were able to select songs to play and songs not to play. It was very easy. About a month before the wedding Katie called and reminded us to schedule a meeting with Chris to discuss logistics and planning. We made the meeting and discussed all the details. It's always nice to work with someone who can do the job efficiently. He was quick to answer questions and during our meeting he made sure we understood what to expect at our event. We talked about the start and stop time along with set-up and break-down. Once our meeting was over we received a copy of the report for the DJ to refer to. It was accurate and easy to read. On the night of our wedding Trevor (our DJ) arrived on time and had the place all set up. He had the lighting just as I had asked and he had his area all set up. Trevor was friendly and had just the right amount of energy! Trevor had people on the dance floor all night and really seemed to know which songs to play. He really was ""feeling the crowd"". I think it was a great night and he made sure to keep the energy flowing throughout the night. There were times when I needed to ask him to make an announcement and he did without complaint. Trevor really has a great personality and I think he rocked our wedding dance floor! I would absolutely work with TKO again.",2017-05-18 03:03:27

First things first, I really wanted to like this place: Its in a great location in West Chester, has outdoor seating, great oyster selection, and is one of the few exclusive seafood restaurants in the area (I love seafood).

We went here in a group of 7 for my good friend's girlfriend's birthday.

Sat at the bar for drinks waiting for the rest of the party, bartender was friendly and beers are beers.

As the other people arrived we were seated immediately in the back corner.

While the waitress was friendly, she was clearly new, and not trained very well. She did not know the specials, or the drink policy of the day (let us order an unavailable drink for that day).

I ordered 2 apps, a pound of sauteed littleneck clams, and half dozen oyster on the half.

First the clams: Portion was skimpy, barely a dozen. Clams were cooked properly but were very gritty, broth was over-reduced and way too salty.

Oysters: The waitress got my order wrong and gave me 2 of the wrong kind. no big deal. But the quality of the oysters were sub-par at best. The guy shucking the oysters had no idea of what he was doing; they were mangled, i mean like he stuck the knife into the oyster, blended it, pried it open, poured the liquor out and threw it on a metal pan, with jarred cocktail sauce, and a lemon. There was barely half the oyster left. At practically $3 a piece, i was disappointed. 

I ordered the crab cake sandwich as a main. The waitress got the order wrong, and I received the crab cake entree. Sent it back, came back to me on a stale bun (the one crab cake from the previous plate), was cold, tasted of being previously frozen, and definitely canned crab meat, and now included a side of frozen french fries.

I shook my head as a got the bill and signed the $70 check (just for my food and drink).

Such a shame, this place has so much going for it, just bad management.

Main strike:  Bland, bland, bland pasta sauces.  Four total pasta dishes were ordered amongst our party, and the verdict was the same for each:  Bland.  Uninspired.  Just... disappointing.

I had the Penne Michaelangelo which was described as coming ""in a creamy Vodka-based tomato sauce.""  Honestly, it just tasted like basic marinara to me.  I added the optional chicken breast for an additional $4.  This was dry and had clearly been pre-cooked at least an hour or so beforehand.  Total price of this dish came to $16.00. 

It rarely ever occurs to me to reach for the salt at a restaurant, but at Ricardo's I believe we all did.  Heck, I was pouring Parmesan all over mine and stirring it in.  I just kept thinking:  ""This tastes just like sauce from a can at the grocery store..""

And when you pair that lack of flavor with the price Ricardo's charges, that is where I cannot rate above 2.5 stars.

The place looks great on the outside with a classic oyster house feel. Inside is dimly-lit and welcoming, with a warm and friendly staff. I always order a dozen of their raw clams. Clams have more taste and texture than oysters, they are absolutely divine. Then dozens of raw oysters are ordered from their ample daily selections menu. If I do order something on the side, it would usually just be fries or the peel 'n eat shrimp. Just something little, the oysters are the main attraction.

When I buy high-priced coffee, I like to have it in a real mug, not a cardboard cup that I could get at any fast-food joint. When the people here mistakenly put mine in a cardboard cup, I did not ask for a new coffee. Instead, I politely pointed it out in the hopes that they would get it right the next time. In return, I got an argument and nasty looks from the crew at the counter. Also, no matter now many people they have at the counter, they manage to keep even small groups of customers waiting on long lines.

Yesterday was the kicker. I asked for a decaf coffee and told there was no decaf. Even your average diner will usually ask a customer if he or she wants to wait while they brew up a pot of decaf. And this is a fancy café? I then asked if they had decaf espresso and was told that this too was all out.

The place is well thought out, there is definitely a plan he is following.  The layout, design and offering of clothing, shoes, bags, watches, shaving items and other manly essentials reflects his style.  A style that is gaining traction.

This isn't an every-man's store and thankfully the masses have wally world to shop at.  I'm in management but at a construction contractor so dressing up is not necessary.  Ah!! the weekends come and I want to look like I DON""T shop at wally world!  And when I play with my band, the peter rabbit shirt I got from here is perfect.
So,  it may seem niche for now but as more guys get into finding a style they like or get fed up wearing crap that shrinks, doesn't fit, is uncomfortable or the need to grow that 'stache, there's stuff here for every man.  

Most stores for men lack imagination in every way, no such thing here.  I've found myself looking into the local brands that are offered here and finding an interesting story behind each one.  It allows me to 'buy local'  and while usually more expensive it makes me feel better about my purchase.

I was not impressed, with the exception of one employee who was terrific.  I showed up for a ""tap takeover""....which was anything but.  

Grabbing a seat at the bar.... the first thing to notice was nearly the entire staff gathered at the service station and yapping to each other....never mind the customers...lets stare at our phones, show each other FB posts, and generally do anything that doesn't resemble ""service"".

Exactly 11 minutes and 15 seconds after sitting down, and finally a nice woman inquired as to whether I had been helped.  Nope, not yet !   Don't think my time banished to Irrelevant Island was wasted time....indeed...I was treated to a very entertaining display of the virtuosity of a tres cool bartender totally focusing his benevolent attention on two younger women who giggled and cooed in appreciation of his irreverent commentary and display of serious bartender mad magic skills....this man walked in front of me no less than 9 times...and I am grateful he failed to notice the guy with the red sweatshirt and giant phone....as this allowed the Flirt Show to continue unabated.  Regrettably the two young women were probably a bit disappointed when he would leave to share what undoubtedly were insanely humorous anecdotes and impossibly beneficial life changing commentary to his coworkers at the opposite end of the bar.

This was followed by a man emerging from the bowels of the restaurant with a cash drawer...who could not muster a smile or a hello to customers that presumably might fill said cash drawer.

The beer selection was typical, and fine. But hardly earth shattering in terms of variety...fewer taps than the previous incarnation. The menu IMO, showed little imagination in terms of offerings, and what unfortunately passes as acceptable food in the Midwest.  Basically nothing even remotely healthy....deep fried tacos ""Puffy"" as a signature dish in the middle of the menu ???   Maybe at a college dive bar....but for a place purportedly appealing to an ""older"" crowd....not so much.  Their supposed commitment to ""locally sourced"", or whatever similar term they use, is dubious at best.  Most items appeared to be the type that COULD be fresh off the Sysco truck and right out of the freezer.  

I was afforded further entertainment opportunities watching what few customers were in the place....attempting to flag down their servers for things like water and napkins.  Hint to all servers....if ya are bringing things like Philly cheese steaks, wings, nachos....bring extra napkins.  Don't make customers hold up their hands as if just after washing and just prior to surgery...in an attempt to keep well sauced fingers from soiling their clothing.

Nice tvs, and plenty of them, in... I believe the same locations as before....and as is fairly common across this great land of chain restaurants.  The décor is an upgrade of the previous tenant....but the weird to me.... sort of half-barrel booths in the middle of floor may be sufficiently innovative to appeal to folks looking for a bit of privacy while still enjoying being part of the action.  I however, prefer not to be ensconced, thereby not hindering my creepy ostentatious gazing of hot chicks.

We shared the lobster fried rice which was okay- not an abundance of lobster and a consistency that made it very difficult to eat with chopsticks. Finally we got 3 sushi rolls (2 house rolls and a special roll). They were tasty but not spectacular and had a tendency to fall apart easily.

We had to toast the bread just so we could actually swallow i The sesame butter cookies were fantastic: light, crisp, covered in sesame seeds, and containing the perfect amount of sweetness.  These are much akin to the butter cookies from Roma's and Isgro's, except with an Asian twist, compliments of the sesame seeds.  The almond puffs are also quite delish and very flaky and light with plenty of sliced, toasted almonds and a drizzle of honey on top.

(I know, I should know this) My date and I decided to go for the sampler appetizer, the BLT and the Philly steak n cheese. The appetizer was really good consisting of pickle chips, boneless buffalo wings, and mozzarella cubes. The pickle chips were pretty tasty. The buffalo wings were the norm and the mozzarella cubes were okay. Nothing to write home about. My BLT was nicely prepared but I didn't care for the spicy bacon (may have been pepper bacon) and the lack of mayo. The sourdough  bread it was served on was really good. My date didn't care for the Philly steak n cheese. He said the bread wasn't very good. He said Penn Station is better. The fire fried that come with the sandwiches are thicker cute and pretty good.

I will give them another shot to try the pot roast but if it isn't good I probably won't go here again.

i would say that the sauce is nice and punchy but i wish there were a little more of it and that it had a good dose of sesame oil and at least the beef version should have a sprinkling of sesame seeds on top

both the beef and chicken could have been more seasoned and i wish there was a small side of kimchi

but given that the veggie portion (which is actually more important than the meat in a dish like this) was quite extensive and done well, i would definitely suggest this for vegetarian friends (veggie or tofu)

It was a big job that was paid for by the other driver's insurance, but Craig and his team at Iron Horse always treated me like the one who was paying and did an excellent job repairing the damage.  I was very pleased with the experience and would certainly have brought a vehicle back to him, but then something happened that really showed what a great business Iron Horse is:

A couple of weeks ago I started to notice a musty smell in my car, and I discovered that the carpet behind the passenger seat was soaking wet. I thought that maybe there had been some damage to the car from the accident in January that wasn't immediately apparent, but the little bit of rain we have had in Santa Barbara combined with taking my car to the car wash a few times had exposed a leak somewhere. So I took my car back to Iron Horse on Monday morning to see if the leak could be related to the rear end accident. Craig said that he thought it was highly unlikely, but he told me that he would take a look to confirm just to make sure they hadn't missed anything. At this point I was feeling pretty disappointed because if the leak was unrelated to the accident, I would be footing the bill to do the repair. 

As he had assumed, the leak was not coming from anything related to the accident, but he didn't stop there. He had his guys take apart the whole interior and dry out the wet carpet and pad while he searched online to try to figure out the source of the leak. Eventually they determined that the leak was actually caused by leaves that had blocked a drain behind the front right wheel. They cleared out the leaves, let my car dry out over night, and then put everything back together. I came back Tuesday afternoon and the car was reassembled and cleaned inside and out, and Craig insisted that there was NO CHARGE!

Suffice it to say, I will only be taking my cars to Iron Horse Auto Body from now on, and I'll send all my friends as well.",2015-07-22 16:00:58

The ambience is lovely, located in the high-ceilinged Mercer building in the warehouse district.  Charming interiors, quite beautiful furniture, intriguing wall art, Edison-era light installations and what not.  They might have the best ambience any cafe in Edmonton has.  Perfect date place too, I think, with decent music playing and comfortable furniture for quiet conversations.

I've been here twice and agree with most reviewers in that they make interesting latte creations and teas.   I think they briefly had a caramel-bacon latte which sounds really interesting and I enjoyed their salted caramel latte.  They have a collection of craft beers and wines mainly from AB and the Okanagan region.  It's interesting and I'm glad they support local craft brews and wines, though at least on the beer front, these regions are not known for the best craft brews in Canada.

Why the 3 stars? Many might consider me a coffee snob when I say this, but I actually think that for $5, it's only fair that the quality of the actual espresso be far better than something you would get at a chain coffee shop.  This, however, they lack in.  The staff seem to know very little about actual coffee and how to make a good espresso and this disappoints me a little.  It's got a bit of a yuppie feel to it without delivering a quality product.  

I am not sure if I will go back because I know of places that make better coffee. There are many in Edmonton now (Elm, Transcend, Leva, Credo, Sugar Bowl, da Capo etc.) and to open up a new coffee shop and not strive to at least equal the bar set by these establishments, especially when they charge as much (some cases, more) as these other well established coffee joints, is a little disappointing for me.

Come here for an interesting flavored latte, but don't come if you demand high quality coffee.  The main reason for three stars is that they claim to be a coffeehouse first and don't do too well, in my books, on that front.",2012-12-18 03:21:27

Now he has his own pico-brewery (I am not even sure it would qualify as a nano-brewery with his batch sizes, lol) yet he still loves talking about brewing with other homebrewers.  He still basically is one, his equipment just got a little bigger.  Darren and his crew have McGyvered the entire place.  He built the brewstand he uses, he built his own keg washer, he even engineered and built his own cooler rooms that you see.  The man has truly built the place from the ground up and considered every detail.

When I say he is a pico-brewer, I do not mean that disparagingly.  His super small batches of beer allow him to do things that most other brewers cannot due to scale.  He can control every detail.  He can make sure that everything that goes in is top quality.  His attention to detail and high level of skill shows through in his brews.  Even beer styles that I do not like I can try there and think ""Not my thing, but DAMN it is made well!""

Those small batches show his skill in other ways.  When you have tiny batches such as his, tiny errors show through in huge ways.  Multi-thousan gallon batches can hide errors.  When you brew less than a 100 gallons at a time even a few grams on some ingredients can make drastic changes.  The fact that he can consistently brew great beer in small quantities shows the skill of the brewers at Bier Brewery.

And seriously, who doesn't love walking into a place and being greeted by a dog??  :)",2012-05-10 18:17:38

Set in the delightfully trendy Mercer Building alongside Mercer Tavern, Startup Edmonton and FaBLOOMosity ( a flower shop), Roast's second floor decor is comfy luxury. 

They are having some just-opened growing pains that involves installing a new transformer to handle the expresso machine but they are still open for business offering delectable breakfast and lunch options, brewed Verve coffee and some soul-changing loose leaf iced teas. 

After Friday's Social Media Breakfast at Startup Edmonton, a few of us work-tardy folks went down to sample Roast. 

Greeted right away by happy people, they won me over by spelling my name on my cup correctly without any prompts. Oh they know the way to a girl's heart. 

My iced tea was a blend of sun-kissed fields, summer promises and a splash of warm rain and my friend's no-caffeine Italian soda option was made with hugs & kisses. 

Opening at 6 am means they are dedicated to the early morning downtown set. Actually their evening hours mean that downtown just got more accessible.

Even granola on yogurt would have earned you an extra star from this reviewer. A 3 minute exception to your hard an fast rule would have earned you 2 more stars despite the food only being a 4.

Calamari was good - plump and tender.  It was downhill from there.  

Shrimp cocktail was mushy and a bit ""iffy"" on the freshness.

Seared scallops were scorched and had a really bad burnt taste because of it.  

Lobster roll was terrible.  Way over dressed.  Drowning in a terrible sour, runny mayo sauce.  I think the lobster was frozen, not fresh.  The lobster was diced very small.  I think all the sauce and the small cut were an attempt to cover up that it wasn't good lobster to begin with.

My husband ate only one of his scallops.  I ate only a bite of my lobster roll.  When clearing our plates, the waitress asked if everything was OK.  I explained that I didn't like the lobster roll.  She came back with a complimentary shot glass of pudding as a consolation prize for the terrible dinner.  I politely turned it down.  The check came and included my $22 lobster roll.  A manager never stopped by to ask us about our concerns.  The waitress was very good and attentive other than not taking care of the issue at the end of the meal.

Long story short, Im 23 and lost my license once so I have a duplicate ID, which understandably gives reason to request secondary identification. Bars usually will accept a credit/debit card, college ID, or have you recite your information to them, but that was not satisfactory for the bouncer here and I had to leave.

Understandable. A job is a job, and I'm all for giving second chances. He told me something with a picture and a date of birth is required, so next week I showed up with my current, valid US Passport.

Nope! Denied again. Funny thing, the bouncer said if I was a non-american he could accept my passport as valid ID.

This was upsetting cause I'm tired of going to the same bars in my town. I decided to call and speak with the owner/manager the next day. I explained my situation and asked what exactly is required for a person in my situation with a duplicate ID? She said the ONLY thing they would accept is an expired license, which I did not have, so I would not be allowed in. No passports no birth certificates no nothing.

To add salt to the burn, when I mentioned how I felt it was an unreasonable policy and will be discouraging friends from going as a result, she (the owner) said ""You do what you want, Fuck you"" then hung up.

And I wanted to go somewhere i never tried. We went on a Wednesday night around 8:15 pm. There was no wait got seated right away and the waiter was very friendly. The menu is a sheet of paper with lots of options, mostly seafood though, my favorite.

For an appitizer we got the cease and desist fries which were fries with crab and cheese fondue over them. The fries were the perfect crispiness and the fondue was a thick, semi chunky cheese sauce. it tasted like crab but didn't actually taste crab chunks at all so must have been very finely chopped up. It was different but really good.

For my entree i decided to get the fresh fish catch. you get to pick from 7 types of fish, pick the way you want it cooked and then pick the suace you want over it. I got Mahi Mahi grilled with lemon butter sauce. There was a good size of fish grilled perfectly but unfortunately i wasn't a fan of the sauce, too much lemon for me so i just scraped it off. My meal also came with mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Masked potatoes were amazing and the vegetable was cut up squash, zucchini, peppers, and snap peas cooked in some type of sauce. they were good, not overcooked.

My friend got the surf and turf with a 6 oz filet and crab cake. the filet was the perfect size and looked like it cut very easily. unfortunately she asked for medium well and it was more medium so had to send it back. The crab cake was good, i know because i tasted it lol. Her meal also came with the potato and vegetables.

Cesarina Deli is a simple but nice dining location on East Bay.   While it looked like most coming in and out were there for the deli sandwich choices, they've got a few shelves of the most popular Italian grocery items.   In the deli prepared food section they carry cured meats, cheeses, olives, about half a dozen pasta choices & and some more cold salad dishes.  They also have several cases with bakery items, bread & cookies.

If you want to dine in there are tables to the left that seat ~20 or so.  But I was here to taste test one of my favorite subs, the sausage & peppers.

My order at the counter was taken fairly quickly even though there were about 5 people in line.  It was well-wrapped in foil to keep it take-out hot and I appreciated that.  And the size of the wrapped sub quickly showed that Cesarina definitely delivers an extremely large sub for the price.

But while it was still hot when I arrived home, when I opened up the foil wrap I found the sorriest looking sausage & peppers sub I've ever seen in my life.  The green peppers and onions were cooked to death in heavy oil to the point they had virtually no flavor.  The oil almost completely soaked the sub roll, and the dry portion of the roll I did manage to taste was not that flavorful and a bit tough to chew.  To top off this sad collection was the sausage link.  While I'm a huge fan of meat in tube form, and I've had many sausages in different ethnic cuisines, most all Italian sausages I've ever found have been a nice mix of  full meat flavor and spice.  But this link was the most bland taste with only spicey hot flavors.  Worse yet, the inside of the link was just ...well, just a disgusting grey color.  I'm not foolish enough to think sausages are made of any prime pork cuts, but hey, if you're going to leave out the flavor at least throw me a bone with some red dye #3 like a hot dog so it resembles something that might be meat related.   Sure, it's a carcinogen, but I'd trade that even up if at least fooled the cro-magnon portion of my meat-eating brain into thinking I was dining on something edible.

Combining the tasteless grey sausage link with likewise sad, soggy sausage and peppers, after two bites I found the entire sub completely inedible and tossed it in the trash.  And I can't think of hardly any food I've ordered in a decade or two that turned my stomach as bad as this sub.

Again, this food review is for one sandwich and nothing else.  And while this experience would normally make me write off Cesarina completely, the other reviews of the cold subs or prepared foods would not stop me from stopping by again and trying one of them.  If I do, I'll update my review and scores accordingly.

They have a nice bar and the food is decent.  The danger of sitting in the restaurant part is that you could be seated in a really weird room totally isolated from the rest of society.  Knowing this, we asked to be seated in the bar area where the atmosphere is more casual.

The waitresses were not busy and liked to avoid eye contact.  They were supernice when we were getting tables together but when it was time to order, it was like our waitress forgot that she was a waitress.  We ordered a meatball sandwich and the menu listed that you could order it as either sliced or whole, so I ordered it sliced.  Her response was, ""Uhh...what?  No one has ever asked me that before.  Let me ask the kitchen if they can do that.""  Listen lady, not only is it on the menu but all you do is take a knife and slice through that sucker like you're cutting a tomato.

We also ordered some unhealthy appetizers, I liked the toasted ravioli.  Garlic bread was huge and cheesy and meh.  I mean, everything was fine.  We wanted to order from the restaurant menu but they made a change recently that you had to order from the bar menu which limited our choices.

At the end of the meal, I gave her my credit card and asked for an itemized receipt after the fact.  The waitress said, ""Umm...I THINK I should be able to do that.""  Listen lady, you already DID do that because you ran my credit card.  I don't know what you did with it.  I admit, it's a bad habit I have from Singapore but I tell you, Singaporean waiters are shit at taking orders and mischarge you half of the time.

Our party had various items from the menu and we all walked away full, happy and so willing to come back again.

George was a great tour guide! Very knowledgeable, interesting, and entertaining. Just a little soft spoken. Wish he would have projected more.

Thought about just doing the walk through the cemetery on our own- but I'm glad we took a tour because we learned about the burial rituals, architecture of the city, history, and facts about Marie Laveau.
After the cemetery portion, we took a break at the visitor's center where we were able to grab a drink and have a bathroom break which was nice.
George then pointed out on a map the geography of New Orleans and talked a little about Katrina, which was a nice addition to the tour.

I was a little disappointed with the voodoo portion. George talked a little at the visitors center about voodoo, and warned us that we we going to Priestess Miriam's shop ( a voodoo priestess), and that sometimes she speaks about voodoo, and other times she is way off topic, and can ramble on and on about whatever. He was right! A lovely woman- but  a bit of a wacko.. she spoke nothing about voodoo. She went on and on about how far our country has come, a funeral she went to in another city, and where everyone was from, but nothing about voodoo. We did get to see her ""office"" where she does readings and that was pretty cool I guess. She was sweet.. but dang! I wanted some voodoo info!

Like the Mercer Tavern next door Roast takes advantage of the old warehouse in which it is housed. It's spacious, trendy, and comfortable; an atmosphere well worth a $5 latte.

Roast also has some prepackaged quality food, I think from various downtown restaurants. The salads are small, but not too expensive. You can pay extra for your choice off protein (small containers of various meats or tofu). My friend seems to enjoy the baked goods.

      My wife called (I'm out of town again).  The manager of AM & PM came by our house to apologize personally for what happened.  Apparently, when they are busy, they utilize sub-contractors to answer service calls.  This was the case with us.   

       He asked to see our door (I had replaced the missing doorknob), apologized for what happened and gave us a full refund and offered to pay for our new locking doorknob!  
     I am changing my rating to five stars.  This is an example of outstanding customer service and should be commended.  I only wish all business owners could follow the positive example of AM&PM.  I will chalk this up to a case of bad luck with a sub-contractor.
       If I have a need for a locksmith in the future I will call AM & PM first and give them another chance (and making sure it is an AM & PM employee coming out).



/EDIT


The writeup below is what happened after calling AM & PM and getting a sub-contractor:


Horrible experience...stay clear of AM-PM!   My wife locked herself out of the house on a Friday afternoon after taking the kids for a walk in the stroller.  I was out of town.

   I called @ 4pm, gave them the address and my wife's phone number and was told ""25 minutes, tops"".  Well 25 minutes later, they were not at the house so I called back...""another 20 minutes"" was the estimate given.
    Then 25 minutes after that, my wife gets a call with an estimate of ""7 minutes away""
      1 hour and 5 minutes after my initial call, an unmarked blue van shows up.  The locksmith is not wearing any kind of uniform, just jeans and tshirt.

     The lock in question is a $15 kwickset, 5 pin key-in knob, residential exterior doorknob.  This is the kind of lock where amatuers demonstrate successfully picking this lock in 30 seconds on youtube.

      David, the locksmith, works on the lock for 45 minutes and can't pick it!
 
    He gives up and drills out the cylinder and finally gets in.  After all this, with a delay that is 3 times the original estimate, he charges my wife $150.  In addition, he steals the entire knob, lock and latchplate assembly from our door without asking!  He just left us with a door with a big hole in it and a pile of metal shavings for us to clean up.
  
     I had to guess as to the type and finish of the knob to replace the lock since I didn't have the old knob.

General consensus at my table was that everyone loved their food, especially the one who ordered Manicotti. I really enjoyed the house Italian salad and the Writer's Block petit syrah complemented my food quite well. 

My only ""thing"" was that my Chicken Spiedini was... delicious... but the breading was just slightly burned and it made the chicken a bit chewy (Yikes!). Also, when being served a baked potato, its generally expected that a dish of whipped butter be served with it, however, in this case we had to open a ton of tiny packets and it got messy quick.

All of this being said, the service is not by any means sub-par. You are greeted, seated, and then treated as though you are of great importance without being pestered incessantly. They trust that you are going to enjoy your service without the need to ""perform"" for a tip. Ricardo's is family-owned and they treat you as such.

Passyunk, it definitely ranks as the second worst in the greater Philly area I've been to. When I moved back to Philly last year I was happy to see the place got a face-lift, but disappointed to learn the improvements were solely cosmetic. That, combined with the fact that it's only a couple blocks away from me, has raised my frustration level with the place high enough to give it only one star. Why?

1. Products (especially dry/jarred/canned goods) are frequently left on the shelves long after their expiration dates.

2. Selection isn't that good, and when it comes to the deli section it's not nearly as good as many Shop-Rites or Acmes (or Fresh Grocer for that matter). Hell, one time I was going to buy Russian dressing and there was a whole isle full of all kinds of dressing but no Russian (except for the red, syrupy Wish-Bone kind, which isn't real Russian dressing by a long shot). I mean, what the hell kind of supermarket of that size doesn't carry Russian dressing? One time I couldn't even find plain English muffins-- raisin, low-carb, but no regular. And no salad/olive/mozzarella bar? What the hell?

3. Products are often stocked and organized counterintuitively, making it difficult to find items. Moreover the cheese section in the deli area does not have the individual containers marked, and stocks them haphazardly to where the product doesn't match the price label next to it. Want to know how much that Brie or Pecorino Romano is before you put it in the basket? Well, there's a damn good shot you'll have no clue because it's not properly marked.

4. The store is often understaffed, especially on weekends, and even worse on holiday weekends. On some holiday weekends the lines that form are staggering-- snaking around the length of all the aisles, and not even half of the aisles are in service. I've never seen anything like it in any other supermarket I've been to.

Whoever the general manager is here should be immediately fired for their horrifying level of incompetence and shameful mismanagement. And not sure if it's the owner/corporate or GM's fault, but spending all that money on purely cosmetic renovations but not on hiring more staff or better supervision-- downright stupid.",2009-04-20 21:06:02

Our waitress was very friendly and the place was nicely decorated and fun without being dingy. Food was really steep ($9 for 10 wings, pasta dishes were $16-$18). We just went for calamari (OK) and a berry tart (yum!). 
The band was great, totally got people moving. When they were taking a break, they played a mix-music-video set that was surprisingly really good and even got my boyfriend dancing (the transitions between songs were really good...I'm all about transitions lol)
Definitely come here for the $5 fish bowls, $3 soco lime shots, music, and service. You also have the option to sit down with your drink and chill with friends before getting up to get rowdy. Don't come here for food unless you got some green to spend.

I don't know about you, but it's rare to be utterly disappointed after that. Or, perhaps you just don't let yourself be. The importance of good reception should not be overlooked!

With that in mind, I bring you my review of Ricardo's Italian Cafe. I had been drinking coffee all morning at the fabulous Park Avenue Coffee next door, but alas, a low fat blueberry muffin did not keep me sated for more than 3 hours, so come lunchtime, I checked Yelp and was overjoyed to see an Italian restaurant is located right next door. Especially because St. Louis is known to have some damn good Italian American food!

I was seated by window without even asking. Bonus points again for first impressions here! The menu has a good amount of pasta dishes, but I was dazzled by the eggplant parmesan, as is typical for me. It's offered both as a small plate and as an entree (don't quote me on this, but I believe the full size portion is offered on a lunch special).

Molto sadness: apparently due to the freeze in Mexico, there are no eggplants to be had, as I was told by the waitress. Soooo, if you were hoping to get locally sourced vegetables, well it ain't happening here (I know, I know... eggplant isn't in season in MO right now). I instead ordered the minestrone and penne tossed with garlic, oil and vegetables.

The Minestrone... I hate to say this, when I wanted to like a place so much (yes, that warm greeting really does go a long way), but it is possibly the worst I've ever had. I hate likening anything in a restaurant to store bought, but this is the stuff that Campbell's Alphabet soup is made of. Inexcusable in an Italian restaurant.

On to the main course: let's say it made up for the soup in droves. I quite possible inhaled this dish! Delicious pasta, crisp broccoli, fresh mushrooms with just the right amount of olive oil and garlic. Perfection.

The ambiance of the restaurant lends itself well to both a business lunch or a romantic dinner. There are two cozy dining rooms (you enter through the bar) and while it won't be winning any design awards, it's a familiar kind of scene that conjures up Italian American bistros across the US and I like this sort of thing. It's not garish with pink lighting and marble busts like Anthony's in Kansas City, and several notches above my beloved Milo's here in Saint Louis. 

I do think I'd return to Ricardo's when in the neighborhood. I judge most Italian American places by their marinara sauce, which I didn't get to try here. Next time! For now, though...

 Imagine my shock when they refused to give me a pass for the day  and I paid $13 to find out that  the gym had inferior equipment , more dirt , fewer location options and less room  (at a higher rate) than the gym from which I was considering switching.  

That having been said, from a convenience stand point alone , I probably would have switched to be able to go there a few days a week when on this side of town. 

I recently bought a groupon for an insanely low price so looked at it as an opportunity to get my money's worth and save some time a few days a week.  Having read the ""small print"" carefully, I walked in with my keys, water and head phones ready to train at which time the front desk kid asked for an id for which I had to walk back out to my car as it is stated NO WHERE on the groupon that an ID must be presented. 

While I was working on the leg press there today , a guy came over and slammed 45 lb weights onto the machine  so hard, it caused the entire machine to shake .. while I was doing single leg presses which could have caused serious injury to my knee.  I finally had to stop and wait for him to finish racking his weights.  He did it not ONCE but THREE times. Seriously? This goes well beyond bad gym etiquette and lack of manners to causing serious injury to someone.  THAT is the type of members you will find there. 

I've managed gyms in 3 states and currently own a company in the fitness industry which does close to 7 figures and just celebrated it's 18 year anniversary and would NEVER dream of treating potential customers so rudely. 

If  this is how they treat potential customers, I'd hate to see how they treat their members.  I guess that's why they have to run groupons to fill the place",2014-10-19 15:07:12

The food was a mixed bag. I had the cheese bites as an appetizer. They were fantastic. My only complaint was that there weren't enough of them. My meal was  was the bbq bacon burger and fries. The fries were pretty good. They are a steak fry with a season salt. I would have liked more seasoning but my fiancé wanted less. The burger is the problem. It had great presentation and the bacon was done well but when I started getting into the burger, it fell flat on flavor. There was very little sauce and the meat didn't have a full grilled taste.

Don't even get me started on their fresh-baked Italian bread. If you're from up north, then you know real Italian bread is hard to find down here, but not anymore!

I went to the actual store today for lunch and was torn between the ""30 napkin"" meatball sub, and the Italian.  I saw someone else order the meatball, and it was offensively MASSIVE.  I imagine a fork and knife is required because unless you're a retired porn actress, your mouth probably doesn't open that wide.  The freaking meatballs are the size of tennis balls.  No joke.

I was wearing a shirt I really like, so I went the less-saucy route and ordered an Italian sub.  As soon as the woman behind the counter grabbed the bread, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to take it down, so I immediately asked them for half to go.  The bread is probably 13 or 14 inches, but it's the girth that stands out.  This ain't no Publix or Subway bread.  This sandwich was big, thick and meaty.  And just to spice it up a bit, I added Capocollo to it.  What I ended up with was the best Italian sub I've had in Florida.  A full 5 out of 5 on my Italian sub scale.

Lastly, it should be noted that this place is a market and deli store that sells a lot of imported grocery items.  There are a few tables for those who wish to dine in, but while I was there, most people called ahead and got their orders to go.

Our guide on all the tours was George and he was great! He goes in to a lot of historical detail and really knows his stuff. He was very nice and always willing to answer questions the best he could. If he didn't know the answer he would say he didn't know instead of making some crap up. He also seemed very plugged in to the community which was cool as well cause he could give personal stories. I learned a lot about what voodoo actually is and not the Hollywood version. Very interesting. 
The ghost tour was our favorite. It is not the made theatrical crap some of the other tour companies seem to do. I would much rather have someone like George give me the documented factual accounts rather than some 20something chick with piercings who pretends to be a vampire on the weekends bs.  If you do not believe in the paranormal take this tour and take lots of random pictures of the balconies.

Interesting. The food was ""A-OK."" We had a nice bottle of wine, I had a tasty pizza, and my Italian had steak and pasta.

First the good. The food and drinks were excellent. The beer menu was a little on the shorter side, but they had a nice variety of draft and bottled beer, My wife ordered an alcoholic lemonade (the name escapes me) which I tasted and I can say it was dangerously good. We started with a half perfect storm which is raw clams and oysters crab and shrimp. It was pretty decent considering how far inland we are (although my clams were slightly gritty.) 

For my entree I got the sirloin/ crab cake combo. The steak was delicious, definitely a quality cut of meat. The crab cake was slightly bland but the sauce really helped to pep it up. The sides were excellent and complimented the food nicely. My wife had the scallops which I can say were pretty damn good (and I'm not a scallops fan.) Desserts were tasty but small we ended up getting ice cream on the way home to satisfy the sweet tooth. 

The atmosphere was really nice. It has a friendly, old-world, everything is handmade look to it, but both the restaurant and the bathrooms were very clean. The temperature in the restaurant was great (it was a very cold day) but the bathrooms were frigid. There decor consisted of old and new pictures and knickknacks and really helped to enhance the ambiance.

Now for the bad. Our server was, there's no other word for it, incompetent. We had to ask for our water and he didn't remember to get it until after our appetizer was on the table, he did not know the specials and had to go ask his manager several very basic questions about the menu. It sometimes took several minutes for him to go get us something as simple as a refill. My wife's dish was missing one of it's sides and when she pointed that out he said ""I was wondering about that"". I really think he was upset because we interrupted him hitting on the new bartender and it showed in his service.  Frankly he is the only reason that Doc's isn't rated five stars. 

Overall Doc's had great food, great drinks and a really nice atmosphere and I would go there again, I would just make sure we sat in a different section.

Yes, prices are higher than used bookstores, but that's how it's always been. B&N always has great sales once or twice a month and has a huge clearance selection, so if you disagree with the price of a brand new hardback, either wait for the paperback or come back for a sale. Or, better yet, become a member and get ridiculous discounts on everything.

I come here all the time, and went to the store before it moved, and I've always had a great experience. The store is well organized (and ACTUALLY in alphabetical order) and now that they've moved, it's humongous. No more awkward aisle shuffling when someone else wants the same book as you. They don't mind if you sit and read for a bit, and the cafe is quick and friendly. Tech support for Nooks users is always available and they seem like they know what they're talking about. Now that I have a niece, I actually visit the children's section and appreciate that it's never a jumbled, grimy mess. They have everything labelled by age group to make it easy. 

As for the staff, they are always available and friendly and know their stuff. If I mention an author, odds are they know who it is and where to find it. If they don't have what you need in store, they jump at the chance to order it to be delivered to their store. The only reason I don't give this place five stars is because they suffer from the perpetual understaffed checkout line that many large retailers are afflicted with. I wouldn't blame customer service on that--I'd blame the chain.

They have a version of mozzarella sticks that are a must try.  They're more like two slabs of cheese fried and then smothered in marinara sauce with basil and parmesan sprinkled on top.  Very good and you can use the extra sauce to dip the complimentary bread in.

The menu lacks flavor on all things but their marinara sauce.  The marinara sauce is not too sweet, not too tomatoey, not too bitter.  The fettuccine alfredo is bland and requires lots of red peppers.  The mozzarella prosciutto sandwich is my favorite thing on the menu, the bread is soft with a firm crust, the meats and cheeses are only alright at best, but the mustard-mayonnaise sauce gives it a nice kick.

Next, my friend ordered a bagel with cream cheese and tomato slices, and was sorely disappointed in the measly portion of 3 tiny slices of ""crisp"" and utterly flavorless Roma tomatoes that were given. For their prices, one should be getting organic tomatoes, or at least larger, juicier, higher-quality ripe tomatoes. Strike 2. My son and I waited a solid 15 minutes for our egg sandwiches to come out, and watched as others who came in after us received their orders well before us. When we did get the sandwiches, we had to do a careful investigation to find the egg. We had ordered scrambled, and upon close inspection under the ""hood"" we finally found it: the thinnest ""patty"" of egg I have ever encountered, barely to be tasted within all the brioche bun. My 7-year old asked, ""Where's the egg?"" and I should have brought it back up to the manager to show what was actually coming out of the kitchen for $8.  Strike 3. The croissant my daughter ordered was not flaky or fresh (Renaud's is infinitely better) and she left a lot of it on her plate (something she never does). It's too bad, because the location is good, atmosphere OK, and their bagels better than most in the area (lots of chew and tug, hearty).

The parking lot was about half filled, but it looked like a lot less people inside as the restaurant is HUGE and very open. We were greeted by no less than 6 waitresses/hostesses standing around the hostess station. The person taking us to our table, who ended up being our waitress, decided to finish her conversation she was having with the other girls before seating us. It was kind of annoying, but she was very pleasant otherwise. 

The menu isn't extensive as others have previously mentioned. I decided on the ""hangover burger"" which is your basic hamburger with the addition of a fried egg on top. It was good but I have to say I prefer the Royal Red Robin over it. The fries served with it were pretty tasty with the seasoning they added to them. My Wife decided to just get the pulled pork nachos appetizer for her meal and we would share them. WOW there was a lot of food on that plate. They were very good, but I was too full to be of much help after my burger and we barely scratched the surface. At one point the waitress came by and said, ""I was going to tell you how big they were after you ordered them.""......haha ok why didn't you? We took them home and had them the next day. No big deal. 

My favorite part about Twin Peaks, besides the obvious, was how cold the beer was! They are very proud of how cold they keep the beer as there is an indicator on the wall keeping customers informed of just how cold it was. It fluctuated from 27 to 30 degrees while we were there. While there isn't an overabundance of choices, it was super refreshing. The top of the beer had small ice crystals forming it was so cold. DELICIOUS! Especially on a 90 degree day.

I don't think it would be a monthly trip, but we would definitely take friends back for the experience or just drop in for a drink. Like I said, the inside was huge with plenty of TVs everywhere you looked. It would be a great place to take a big group.",2015-07-15 14:35:38

The Indy 500.  While thousands rushed to the track to drown themselves in alcohol in the blazing sun watching race cars zoom across the track going at speeds I've never traveled, I learned in the background.  I made a decision to go in search of a good spot to watch the race on television yesterday and that is a good thing today.  It sent me spiraling to Twin Peaks, a place I had listed on my calendar and scratched off the original day I chose to go.  Still my sub-conscious would not let me forget what I had tried to erase.  It pushed me in that direction and I arrived and met my destiny restoring the balance of today.  I walked in with a quarter.  I ordered a water and sat at the bar.  My bartender was a seasoned veteran.  She'd been there since it opened.  Her next career goal in life is to be a housewife.  I sat there for hours, just learning from the environment and her.  The pack sitting to my left get louder as their drinks keep getting refilled.  One of them speaks up and decides to order shots for the group.  I chime in, can I have one too?  No.  Then he changes his mind, calls it karma, and orders me up one.  Did we just become best friends?  No.  I soon learn what attracts me to the bartender, she reminds me of a person I knew in the past, Heather.  Coincidentally enough, a red head strolls into the bar to work next to my bartender and her name is Heather.  So I spend a few hours there just learning and being in the space.  I'm not a king.  I say at one point to the guy who bought the shots.  Kiss the ring bitch.  His response, drowning himself in booze.  When him and his pack are about to leave, he bows and kisses my hand.  

I return after a visit home for a nap and dinner.  My bartender and Heather are still there, grinding it through on a Sunday race day.  I order a glass a house red and the banana pudding.

We had dinner reservations for 7:00 on a Friday night; however, our group was running a little late and so I called to see if we could push back our reservations 30 minutes and the hostess was more than happy to accommodate my request! How awesome is that? 

Our group arrived just around 7:30 and we were greeted immediately by a hostess. She brought us to our table and introduced our server to us. We had water on the table almost immediately and also a basket of bread was brought out right away! Our server came over and explained the menu to us and made some recommendations. I wish I could remember his name because he was really great! We placed our drink orders and then he gave us time to review the menu. 

By the time he came back with our drinks we were ready to order. I asked for a small order of the manicotti. Others at the table ordered the lasagna and I believe my boyfriend ordered a steak with a side of pasta. We also ordered individual salads for an appetizer. 

The salads came out rather quickly and I was actually really impressed that they did keep the dressing on the side as I hate when a salad is pre-coated with dressing. Our server offered cracked pepper as well as Parmesan cheese for a topping as well. While we were eating our salads our water glasses were being refilled and a new basket of bread was being delivered. 

Once we were done with our salads the meals were delivered to our table and it all looked and smelled delicious. I couldn't wait to dig in. The small order of manicotti was just perfect for me. Our server offered Parmesan cheese again and then he allowed us time to try our meals before coming back to check in on us. I could tell we were all enjoying our meals since we didn't talk much. I also think we all ate everything on our plates-this is a good sign! The meals were delicious. 

Our plates were cleared and now it was time for the dessert order; yes, I was excited to try dessert too! They had a long list of items to try including gooey butter cake, tiramisu, ice cream, and of course a cannoli. I ordered the chocolate chip cannoli and others at the table ordered the ice cream (handmade by Bailey's Chocolate Bar next door). All the desserts were fresh and I really enjoyed the cannoli. I opted to share a few bites with my boyfriend as well and I think he enjoyed it too. 

At the end of the meal our server came over and made sure we had everything we needed before bringing over our check. What I liked most about this place is that we were never rushed to do anything. It was a very laid back experience for all of us.

The servers do wear low cut shirts and shorts, but nothing that was any different than other themed sports bars. When I was there, there were groups of women together and also couples there. There were a few families with children there.

The first one, in the garden district, was not great, so my friends recommended I try another one and to book one in the French Quarter. And I'm so glad I did! I met up with Tiny, the awesome tour guide, and no one else showed up so he took me out on a private nighttime walking tour of the French Quarter.
O. M. G. I was sooo scared the whole time! In a good way. Tiny has the most incredibly detailed stories and amazing historical facts. What a memory! The whole time I felt like I was reading a book. That's how detailed he was. There were moments that I was so creeped out though that I had to ask him to not share any more details lol I didn't know how I was going to sleep that night. I think he was also helping make up for the fact that my previous tour with another guide was not great. Which I so appreciate! He kicked it up a few spooky notches!

They have several permanent beers, as well as rotating taps that change weekly. The IPA, according to my husband, was ""not too bitter, and well blended"". PDG (Pretty Damn Good) ale definitely lives up to its name, and the Weizengoot has a really nice array of flavors.

These people should be re-trained, re-located or fired! On Saturday March 3, 2018, I arrived to the Fairfield Inn around 2 pm. (The power was still out in our neighborhood - we live 2 min. away - so we stayed one night.)  I walked through the powered sliding doors and a male front desk person checked me in on the computer, handed me a room key and asked if I wanted to also leave a credit card for ""incidentals."" Having booked the room through Hotels.com I told him I've never been asked to do that before. Why? To cover incidentals, he said, like HD wifi, or if I were to ""trash the room - you know, like a rock star."" What? I was confused. He said it was a joke. What joke - asking me for a credit card? That's when the other front desk person, I later assumed her to be the manager, or at least his supervisor, defended him and explained he was joking about the trashing the room part. Just kidding.
THIS IS NOT A TIME TO JOKE, I told them. I'm sick, with pneumonia. Double pneumonia, actually. Motioning to the lobby filled with people, I told them it's not funny that we are all there because the power went out. That my husband and I spent the previous night feeding wood in the fireplace to keep the pipes from freezing and me warm. That we dragged our mattress downstairs to sleep in front of the fireplace. That I had to run to the Giant that morning and purchase gallons of water so I could flush our toilets. MR. KIDDING HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME HE TOO DID NOT HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. I told him, quite pointedly, that it wasn't my problem and that this is a business. I took the elevator to my room. Only one elevator was working, said Mr. Just Kidding, who walked by as I wondered about the broken elevator (door half open, no sign to indicate it's unusable). I went to find my room on the third floor, which, thank god, was located in the brightest part of a dark hallway - just across from the elevator. I realized there was NO POWER in the room.
I returned to the lobby. There's no power in my room! Yes, they know. Though they had had power all day, the power cut out about 10 minutes before I arrived. And they didn't know when it was going to return. Mind you, this conversation occurred while I sat on the sofa across from the front desk because I was weak. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN I ARRIVED???
Excuses: we were busy when you arrived - didn't you notice? 
They both admonished me for ""yelling and screaming."" NO. I have pneumonia and both my ears are blocked. Elevated voice, very likely! 
A new front desk person came on (it's about 3 p.m.) and I watched her tell a man who had just arrived (and had a reservation) that the power was out. He immediately turned around and walked out mouthing WTF. I dryly said that I wish I had been told thst as soon as I walked in that the power was out. At least she did THAT much for the guy. Again, I'm admonished for ""yelling and screaming"" and ""you don't have to stay here"" and something something about complaining. I get up to return to my room. I round the corner and the power returns (DID THEY STOP THE GUY IN THE PARKING LOT WHO JUST WALKED OUT WTF-ING???).
I return downstairs to get some tea. NO WATER! Supervisor lady sees me motion to an empty urn. Coffee? she asked. Water, I said. It hadn't been flipped yet, she said. Excuses, I thought.
Next morning at breakfast, just after 9 a.m., the coffee urns are empty. I turn around and supervisor lady sees me motioning to them with my hands up in the air. A harried employee shows up with a full urn, plops in it and disappears. I try to pour half and half. Also empty. I turned around and held it up for supervisor lady to see. I had said nothing both times, just motioned. That's when supervisor lady told me it was a full hotel last night. 

OH YEAH, SNOWFLAKE, I HAVE DOUBLE PNEUMONIA AND YOU CANNOT MANAGE A HOTEL, CANNOT RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF A CRISIS, AND INSTEAD ACTED LIKE THE VICTIM. 

I didn't need to speak to her on Sunday. It was just one pitfall after another. 

When we checked out, another front desk lady who had been apparently warned about what a bitch I was choked out a Hope you had a nice stay line. I told her it was memorable and left.

I got a major runaround trying to contact Marriott to complain. Finally, I had to leave a voicemail after the customer care rep stayed on the phone with me for 20 MINUTES trying to transfer me so I could file a complaint. No-one called back. I tried again on Monday and gave Marriott a chance to hear me out before committing to a Yelp or other review. Another 15 minutes on hold.

WHAT a great experience!  The ambience at Ricardo's is tailor-made for a sweet, romantic, elegantly-casual dining experience in their lovely, historic old building - from the cozy, comfortable bar area in the front to the pretty green walls with comfortably-classy decor in the dining room, and a sweet little garden area in the back corner featuring a trellis with touches of floral & greenery, and a stone fountain piece and white wood column for a cozy little dining spot.  The lovely party room we reserved featured great old-world Italian murals on the walls, an old upright piano, and antique low-boy dresser - perfect for the gift table!  And there was plenty of room for a large group to eat, have the Bride & Groom's cake cutting and wine-sipping ceremonies, fill out the guest-pages for their wedding-guest book, and enjoy laughing and visiting together, toasting the Bride and Groom, and just making some wonderful memories of their special day!  Ricardo's was just perfect!
  
Then the food - incredible!  Huge portions for an incredibly reasonable price.  The calamari was really fabulous - not tough at all, and fried wonderfully crunchy!  The toasted ravioli was marvelous!  Ditto for garlic cheese bread - so cheesy!  And the bruschetta was piled with delicious tomato/veggie topping!  The Tortellini Roberto is to-die-for.  The Lasagna got rave reviews.  Everything was delicious, and half-size portions on both the pasta and salad were more than enough!  Several ladies still took some home. 

Everything was wonderful.  And the serving could NOT have been more prompt and gracious.  David was in charge that night, and did an absoutely superb job!  Very welcoming, friendly and extremely helpful and accommodating to move tables where we needed for seating everyone the way we wanted.  And timed all the servings just right.  The appetizers came so fast, and the salads and meal servings came just at the perfect time.  Drinks were kept full, and you hardly knew he was there.  Perfect in every way!

All in all, I don't believe we could have possibly found a better place than Ricardo's.  We will definitely return many times.  Thanks David, Michelle and Mark!  You made our family dinner a night to remember...and our memories will be cherished forever!",2012-01-28 14:54:54

First the frose was very bitter. The champagne used in this is a cheaper brut which needed to be balanced with more sugary elements. Of the 8 girls that came with me no one liked their frose. I sent mine back for champagne. If you want a frose go to sambuca. 

My BYO plate is was under seasoned and poorly cooked. My eggs had no salt or pepper on them and were watery. My bacon sat in it's on grease which is not appetizing. When you cook bacon put it on something to let the grease drip off. My biscuit was the worst of all. It was hard as a rock and most of it was inedible. I tried to eat it because the  raspberry jam looked homemade and I wanted it so bad. I could not bite into the biscuit so I ate the inside layer and left all edges and crust.

The food is why only the 2 stars. I ordered  rustica and my husband ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. I have ordered the rustica on several of our visits it is one of my favorite dishes. But tonight it was dry and the shrimp were small compared to all the other times I have ordered it. They were dry and tough. Size wise they probably were something you could buy in a 60 count bag. I did ask for extra sauce and Jayme was more than happy to get it for me. However, the sauce had a lot of black pepper in it which made it spicy/hot and not very enjoyable. A few pieces of the chicken were fatty. Just not a pleasant experience.  My husband said his alfredo was bland and needed some help. His shrimp was also the same size that were in my dish  and it didn't have very many in his dish. The bread was awesome. Hot and fresh.

Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and had a nice time.  The seafood lovers enjoyed their choices - mahi tacos, some kind of seafood chowder, a salad with four different kinds of seafood on it, and of course, some oysters.  

There weren't many choices for me and my other daughter who is a vegetarian, but we enjoyed the vegetarian linguine provencal dish that we both got.  It was yummy and chock full of some of my faves - roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives, asparagus and tons and tons of capers.  It was a nice size but for the price I would have liked to have gotten a side salad for just a few bucks more, instead of the $8 apiece we had to shell out for salads that consisted of just mixed greens, tomatoes, cukes and a few radishes. 

At $110 including the tip, it was probably THE most expensive lunch we've ever had (luckily the gift card cut that almost in half) so considering the prices, the location (a bit out of the way for me), and the fact that there are literally only 3-4 non-seafood lovers can eat there, I highly doubt we'll ever go there again.

First off, it is located in one of the best neighborhoods in St. Louis City and the surroundings only add to it's ambiance.  

I've been there for a sit down lunch and takeout.  I was a little leery looking at the menu because although I like pasta, it's usually not something I order when eating out and the only time I will is if it's some kind of spicy/cajun pasta.  The first time I went for a sit down lunch, I forced myself to order something different.  I chose a chef salad and the Elisabetta pasta.  Okay we all know what a chef salad is, but I truly enjoyed the chef salad at Ricardo's.  It was all in the ranch dressing.  The pasta was the coup de gras of my meal.  The Elisabetta was a flat pasta with cream sauce (you can choose your sauce) with shrimp, crab and clams.  The pasta was so FIRE!  The sauce was seasoned just right and mingled with the seafood and pasta noodles perfectly.  I had truly underestimated this meal.  I was more than satisfied and full with plenty of pasta leftover for dinner.  The bread that comes with the meal is not so good, but who needs it when the food is so good.  I ordered the small salad and pasta and both were very hearty servings.  If you are a light eater, believe it or not, you could share a small salad and pasta with another person.  The ambiance?  I loved the decor; lots of old world charm, but it was lunchtime and it was kinda noisy.  Noise doesn't really bother me when I'm eating out, but if it's crowded here and you're expecting to be able to hold a intimate conversation, it might be a little difficult.

Take out was also a good experience and it seemed like I got even more food when ordering the same thing as take out.  I wasn't able to get to my pasta as soon as I'd hoped and by the time I sat down to eat, it was cold and kinda gummy, but I wouldn't take any points away from Ricardo's based on my inability to eat take out in a timely manner.

Their regular bibimbap is $7.95 to $9.95 (veggie v. meats). If you want it in a hot stone pot (dolsot bibimbap), its $1 extra. Perks of dolsot - the stone pot crisps up the bottom of the rice which adds a great texture. However, the hot stone pot cooled quickly and I didn't feel like I got enough of a crisp on my rice. Of note, it comes pre-mixed with the sauce, which I wasn't expecting. Meanwhile, if you order the regular it does not come pre-mixed so the vegetables/meat are separated and you can decide how much hot sauce you want to mix in. For this reason, I'd probably get the regular next time.

My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken dolsot bibimbap and the vegetable dolsot bibimbap. Not the best bibimbap I've ever had. Since it came pre-mixed, it's very similar to spicy fried rice, especially since I didn't get enough crispy rice. They all come topped with an over-easy egg, the yolk of which makes a great sauce. For $9.95 and $10.95 it was a bit pricey, since the portions are not very large. We also ordered the seafood pancake, which was delicious, but again a bit pricey since it didn't taste like it was made from scratch.

Overall, lovely little spot. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it for a quick weekday lunch date, but I don't think I'd go out of my way again to return.",2016-12-03 20:59:03

Bier Brewery is one of Indy's newer microbreweries situated on the outskirts of town, which is definitely worth the drive and visit. I stopped by about an hour before closing, which was more than enough time to chat with the servers, learn about the brewery and, of course, sample some product. Oh, and the samples (no pints) are free. Woo Hoo! 

Granted, they aren't the typical 3-4 oz., but if your goal (like mine) is to try a little of everything, they were the perfect sampling sizes for nine different pours. Most of the current brews were lighter in color and flavor with nothing on the dark side, although one of the girls told me they can and have brewed up to 100 different varieties and their tap list rotates constantly...what!? Very impressive.

After enjoying their current lineup, I walked around the relaxed tap room, decked out with couches and lounging chairs. Oh, and if you want further proof that Bier is about quality in addition to quantity, make sure you check out their wall of fame, covered in numerous awards and ribbons from various brewing competitions, including the Great American Beer Festival.

Mike's.

Mike'sMike'sMike'sMike'sMike's.

Guess what day it is? Hump Day!

A very long time ago, in what seems like a different lifetime, I would travel the US in an old car, as a teenager, with the love of my life. She was twice my age, but full of energy and excitement after getting out of a nightmarish marriage that had lasted a decade and a half.

We would take turns driving, and often cross half the country in a day or night. We just kept moving, very rarely stopping anywhere for more than an hour or two. There were no rules or boundaries. No deadline or itinerary. Just movement and pure, unadulterated freedom. With emphasis on unadulterated.

Nashville was always one of our favourite places because of the energy, the nightlife, the impressive skyline, the toasty warm southern weather, the rich riverside air, and the gorgeous blonde girls driving up and down Broadway (this was pre-hipster, so not everyone had beards and vintage clothes from Etsy yet).

One night, I was too tired to complete the 3-plus-hours I still had left to get to Nashville. My darling took over at the wheel, and managed to get us all the way into Nashville without me waking up. She had a tendency to take the wrong highway and end up hours in the wrong direction, but not this time. I woke up parked in front of Mike's Ice Cream. She was nowhere to be found. Although I didn't really lift my head up off the pillow.

At first I thought she must be using the bathroom, but then I looked around, and realized I was on Lower Broadway. The night was dying down, and the last few blondes and their Cowboys (or Cowgirls, even better) were disappearing into alleys or hotel rooms or convertibles. Except that when they got into convertibles they didn't disappear, but you get the idea. Anyway.

Next thing I know, she emerges from Mike's holding a huge, shimmering ice cream cone. What could it be?

She walks over to the passenger window (it was the old days, so it was one of those that you roll down, and we were never big on AC, so it was already down), and presents me with the largest and most appreciated ice cream cone in the history of large, appreciated ice cream cones. It's your favourite, she said. Banana. In a waffle cone, no less. Oh, and here's a banana shake to go with it, she said.

She knew me so well.

Things change. Almost everything changes, actually. Often irreparably. People grow apart. Cities change. People with knit caps who only eat Korean Fusion Tacos made (and owned) by grad students who have never been to Korea, move in en masse.

But some things never change.

I still love her.

I still love traveling.

I still drive a lot, sometimes for no reason.

I still wake up in strange places.

I still love Banana Ice Cream. And banana everything.

And all these years later... far longer than I care to admit or acknowledge...

I still love Mike's.",2017-07-19 13:58:25

For entrees, they have a wide variety of seafood options to chose from. For those who do not like seafood, there are poultry and meat options as well... oh, and salads too! I ordered the grilled scallops (options are: blackened, herb butter or herb gremolata) and I chose the herb gremolata. Delicious!! The scallops were succulant and fresh. My mom ordered the scallops blackened I liked them even more! They are paired with cauliflower mash, roasted fingerling potatoes and string beans. You can also order salmon, mahi-mahi, yellowfin tuna, tilapia, shrimp or the catch of the day prepared this way, and paired with those same sides or sub a salad instead.

Their main courses are also off-the-charts! I highly recommend their brussel sprouts as an appetizer! They are so crispy and the aoili dip compliments the flavor very well. I also recommend their gnocchi for any carb lovers out there! The mushroom pasta was particularly my favorite, however, my friends stated it was slightly salty. 

Their milky way dessert display was beautiful but was it worth the cash? Not really. It was okay. Very tiny cookie bites spread around a big dish mixed with assorted chocolates. I'll definitely skip that dessert and try the other ones next time. 

Their wines and cocktails are pretty cheap! And they also have half-off select wine bottles during happy hour from 3:30 to 5:30 PM. I loved the Eberle Cabernet Sauvignon. Very smooth and not too bitter. 

The only minor complaint about the location is the absence of lighting outdoors at night. Hopefully there will be a string of lights and also working heaters for the winter time in the future. However, these little things won't stop me from coming back! See you real soon Copper Vine. Stay beautiful!",2019-01-03 06:31:26

I stayed at the Fairfield Inn in Kennet Square, PA in September 2016 for business. When I arrived that evening I asked for a refrigerator so that I could store my pumped breast milk. I was told by the front desk receptionist that they were all taken and that the only fridge available is the one in the suites but that I was not allowed to switch rooms because I had booked the room through my company travel agent. When I asked to speak to the manager she said he wasn't there and there wasn't anything he could do about it. I repeatedly asked her to call the manager, which she proceeded to call him at home. She explained the situation to him and she relayed the same message to me that there is nothing that he could do to assist me. I asked to speak to him directly and when I did he reiterated that it was against policy to let me switch rooms and that he couldn't give me a fridge because the front desk associate would have to ""go through every room in the hotel to find one."" He also mentioned that the front desk associate did not have any means to get the fridge to my room.  He told me that I should have requested in advance (through my hotel preferences). I replied that refrigerators are standard in hotels these days. Then, he insisted that there was nothing he could do we got off the phone. The front desk associate then offered to put the milk in the fridge in the back office. I asked if I could see the fridge and she said no. At which point, I refused to leave my expressed milk with her. As a working and nursing mother I was absolutely appalled that they could not accomodate me in any way. They did absolutely nothing to make sure my satisfaction was guaranteed and even implied that this was somehow my own fault because I did not ""request it in advance.""

When I called to make an order for delivery I was frustrated within the first minute, the person who was taking my order sounded like they were high and what should have been a two minute phone order was almost a 10 minute ordeal. Finally got my food and was immediately upset when I opened the box of pizza and instead of green peppers like I asked for, they were red (okay okay its just a difference in color, no biggie) but also the pizza was barely warm. Weird since I only live two blocks away. Then, my boyfriend unwrapped his italian hoagie. We specifically asked for mayo plus sweet peppers and pickles, none of those items were on the sandwich. After a bite he realized instead of genoa salami they used cold pepperoni slices (in what world do italian hoagies come with pepperoni?) At this point we were both fed up so I decides to walk down the street to get my money back. I walk into the establishment, said excuse me to the man working the front counter and asked if I could speak to a manager. Maybe five minutes later a man from the back emerges and doesnt even glance at me for more than a second but proceeds to ask the person behind me what they need. I raised my voice loud enough to be heard and asked if he was the manager and he said yes. I told him the pizza was cold and the food was all wrong and instead of immediately apologizing like you'd think any self respecting manager would he tries arguing with me about my complaints. Finally after about five minutes and multiple stares from the other customers he agree to give me a full refund of my money. Not only was I upset with who ever made the food, but I was even more upset by the way this 'manager' handled the situation.

I work in a large office.  A number of people at the office decided this would be a great day to order lunch at Macaroni Grill and take advantage of the 2 for 1 price.  12-16 people placed orders online.  If you are in the restaurant the express lunch is $7.00 ready in 7 minutes or the order is free.  This is not true of the online ordering.  We were fine with this.  We were told by the online order the time our last order would be ready was about 20 minutes.  We arrived in 25 minutes in hopes our orders would be ready.  Long story short, they were not ready and we ended being at the restaurant 35 minutes waiting.  Lots of the food was cold, some people didn't get what they ordered and overall the initial experience was not good.  I called and asked to speak to the manager on duty.  It was Troy but he was behind the counter cooking to help get orders out.  This I could be believe because the restaurant was really really busy.
I left my name and number and asked for him to call me back.  After the lunch rush he called me back.  He was extremely sincere and apologetic.  He asked where we worked and offered to make things right.  He gave us two choices.  He would provide a family style meal or we could do a ""do over"".  I choice the ""do over"" since the whole office didn't order didn't think it would be fair to bring in a family style meal and not share with everyone. Troy give me the direct number to him and told me when he would be in the restaurant.  

Today was ""Do Over"" day.  I called about 45 minutes before we wanted to pick up the order.
Troy remembered speaking to me ( it was 6 days ago), he asked for the orders no questions asked.  I gave him a list of orders and included each person's name. He asked when I wanted to pick up the order.  I said 11:30.  One of the items we ordered were cookies.  He explained they don't always have cookies but he would see what he could do for us. We got to the restaurant and could see things were much calmer.  Our order was being put together and we were asked to have a seat for a few minutes.  At most we waited 5 minutes and we were handed three bags of food, extra dressings, cheese and utensils.  I asked the two people who presented our food to thank Troy for us.  As we were walking out, he called to us and asked us to wait a minute.  He came up to us with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies still hot and gooey.  You could tell they had just come out of the oven. I thanked him again for making this right and going above and beyond.

Thank you again Troy for turning this around.  We will definitely be back.

Went with a few friends for my birthday dinner, we called ahead to ask for an outdoor table at 7- they said they could accommodate us at 7:30. When we arrived at 7:25, they did not have any outdoor seating for us and it would be at least a 20 minute wait. We decided to sit inside. 

It was a normal dinner rush that evening, nothing crazier than normal. All four in my party ordered wine, we did not receive our drinks until AFTER our appetizers. From there on, it was even more disappointing. The server never asked during our meal if everything was fine, the manager that night was walking around and was going to every table but ours to see if they were okay. We waited for about 10-15 minutes with out empty dinner plates in front of us until our server finally came back around- where we were able to order only our second drinks. At the end, we said something to our waiter of how disappointed we were. His response was that there was not enough wine glasses that night. He never got the manager to come over and to talk to us. 

Two of us were/ are servers and it takes a lot for us to complain. With drinks being that late, the server should have told us about the shortage of glasses AND should have had a manager come over to talk to us.

We came in shortly after they opened to beat the rush, and we were sure glad we did: the place was full half an hour later. We picked where we sat, which was two rooms over from the front door, away from the all-too-sunny window. 

The menu was a special one for the house tour and probably more limited. I still found two things on a single page that I wanted: cheese manicotti and capellini pomodoro. It was a rough decision, but the manicotti was recommended as more delicious as I would have asked that the capellini not come with a meatball. It was only $7 for a half order and that included two manicotti. That's a pretty good deal, even for a lunch special, so I went all out and ordered a house salad too. I think the dressing was a red wine vinaigrette. Normally, I'm not all over vinaigrettes, but this wasn't so strong. The cheese was Provel (yay!), and even though it wasn't overly cheesy, the salad was still good, and I think I'll order it when I return for the capellini. The manicotti? Delicious! So soft that I nearly slurped them up whole! Everyone else in my party ordered salted caramel ice cream for dessert and enjoyed it. (I was saving room for the free ice cream on the tour.)

Minus one star for the bathroom situation. It's clean and functional and all, but it's pretty small, there are only two stalls in the women's room, and it's not quite as cute as the rest of Ricardo's.",2014-12-16 12:35:41

The steak was prepared properly and not tough, the mashed potatoes had just the right taste of garlic without over powering, and the broccoli was cooked without being wilted to death.

We ordered coffee and OJ both were good and I ate a chocolate croissant that was amazing! 

However, two of us ordered omelettes, they are $10 and come with one small side. I got mine egg whites with the spinach, tomatoes and goat cheese, I couldn't believe when they brought it out firstly it was tiny secondly it didn't look good it looked like one of those rubbery omelette made in the rubber mold in the microwave. I got potatoes as a side they were awful, super dry and drowned in Parmesan cheese and a cheap cheese. The plating was horrendous too for such a cheap place they stick your omelette on a paper plate with nothing else (it looked sad) and gave you your potatoes in another paper container. Why are they using paper and not real China? It's bad for the environment and made my $10 meal look like a $4 mall food court item. My friend ordered the omelette with whole eggs and grits as the side. Hers looked exactly like mine like it came from an ""As seen on TV"" rubber mold and she had grits on the side. Also she said it was bad. Our other friend ordered the quinoa bowl and mid way through stopped eating it and asked her why, she said they haven't cooked one or two of the vegetables they are still raw and it's not good. 

The service is lackluster, I ordered a side biscuit (which by the way was not good) they don't bring it with butter or jam you have to request it and they send you to wait in the line at the bar for it again. They also aren't friendly the people bringing you the food not the ones at the bar those are super nice. Their water was out so we had to wait for them to refill and that took forever.

I came to this location after my work shift so it's a little after midnight and regardless, this Wawa was packed. I only wanted a hot latte so after putting in my order I braved myself to stand in the line, which only had one cashier and was at least 12 people deep because everyone had to buy their cigarettes. That could be a whole different review, but the cigarette buying process is an endeavor in itself.

My latte was made fairly quickly and the line had not budged so....whatever, I leave my place in line to pick up my drink and go back and wait. The surly drink maker looked at me like I had roaches coming out my eyes when I went up to her and asked if this were my latte, can I just have it while I wait in line, so nobody mistakes it for theirs and takes it?

I know the Wawa rules but it wasn't like I was gonna book it out the door as soon as I got my $3 coffee. Instead, this lady does not give me the coffee and rudely tells me ""why don't you go back and wait in line"" with such a nasty attitude it took all my might not to tell her to f off.

I felt the pressure of the long line and was trying to be courteous to others behind me and felt hurried in my ice cream flavor decision.

I normally stop in on a Friday, and they only let me sample three beers which I think is kind of lame. I also think their name is dumb, and also their slogan is terrible. They NEED better marketing. Whenever I tell someone I stopped by Bier Brewery, they ask me which one (because it just sounds like I stopped by a beer brewery), and then I have to spell their name... annoying! Also, their slogan is ""Come taste our awesomeness!"" This sounds like something an unoriginal frat bro would think of in three seconds, probably while smashed. You can do better!

I stopped in last Friday, and I brought in a couple growlers, and I tried three of their beers (only three due to their imposed limit). After sampling, the guy behind the bar asked ""Do you know what you'll be getting?"" It was that awkward moment where I had to reveal that I really didn't like the three samples I had, and would not be getting any. Why not ask ""What did you think?"" or ""Would you like a growler fill?"" Just a little annoying, because its not the first time this has happened. If they would have let me sample a few more, I probably would have gotten a growler fill, but I just didn't like the ones I tried.

Two of the five of us in the party left with stomach aches due to over salting/seasoning. Lastly, double check your bill. Our server once we were done with brunch came over and gave us our total and didn't supply us with a copy of the bill.

Looking at the menu beforehand, I was prepared for a mediocre experience.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere was great for a date.  I would say this is an excellent place for a business lunch or dinner, too.  We had an opportunity to sit and chat with the owner while waiting for the other couple, then for four of us had a drink at the bar and continued the conversation.  She was very friendly and helpful - obviously willing to do whatever it took to make our visit enjoyable.   

The menu is pretty standard Italian.   We had Lasagna, Cannelloni, Chicken Parmesan and Eggplant Parmesan.  All of the appetizers looked fantastic and the two I tried were great.    A big plus here is they have two sizes for their pasta dishes.  The smaller size is just right for most people and most are priced UNDER $7, so it's an amazing value.  Red wine by the pour was from $6 to $8 - very reasonable for a nicer restaurant, and the pours were very generous while not so full that you couldn't swirl the wine. 

One complaint that keeps this from being a five:  the house salad was only okay - light and vinegary with not as much cheese as we would like.  

A big bonus of eating here is that Bailey's Chocolate Bar and 33 Wine Bar are on the same block, so you can visit either for an after dinner drink or dessert.

2 people (1 kid and me)

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4 stars
Service - 3 stars

Background - Been here many times in the past but do not remember how long it has been since the last visit, more than a year easily.

Atmosphere - Dimly lit restaurant chain with a rustic ""Italian"" feel.  The restaurant was full and half of the customers were prom goers.  While waiting to be seated I just my daughter the cart of logs being hauled in, which led to the conversation about the wood oven they have in the corner of the kitchen.

Food
Appetizer - The free bread they provide before the meal was piping hot, the steamed poured out after pulling it apart with my hands.  The second loft served during the meal was the same way.

Dinner - I had order the Roasted Chicken Cannelloni.  The cheese filling was excellent.  The sauce was not too sweet, just right, but there could have been more.  I would have loved to dip my bread into the sauce.  The chicken had little to no flavor; it could have been very firm tofu.  I would have preferred that the cannelloni be served on a plate instead of a flat wide bowl; it just made the use of a fork a little challenging, as the bowl served no purpose to hold anything in.

Dessert - We skipped this as I had planned on another location for this treat.

Service - The hostess indicated that was a small wait as they were cleaning and prepping the table, not an issue as I was expecting a wait.  A minute later she indicated that she was ready.  While walking to the table half way there we had to turn around as the table was not ready.  When we did get there the table was set up for four people, strange.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  My daughter received an adult sized beverage, I figured she was getting older, so I was comfortable and did not send it back even though she order from the kids menu.  So the bill arrived and her drink was on the tab, as it should not be as it is part of the kid's meal.  They charge $2.20 for a glass of Sprite, really?

We had made reservations in advance and were seated in what I think is the best table of the restaurant - a small table just for two by the window/glass doors. The weather was nice so they had their sliding doors open in which you could feel the breeze and the environment from the outside but also feel like you were part of the upscale dining environment in doors. From either end of the table you got views from the restaurant and from the outside which I thought was magnificent. 

The restaurant per say is beautiful, it has very chic. modern and elegant decor. They have leather booths and small tables and a nice design throughout the restaurant. The music is audible but not extremely loud that disrupts your conversation. 

The service was also very good and our waitress was very pleasant. 

As for the meal everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We tried the shishito peppers which were perfectly seasoned and the fried Brussels sprouts which were also perfectly crunchy. For our main course we ordered both the Fishtown and Old City sushis and they were SO SO GOOD I'm still dreaming about them. The desserts were also good but not mind blowing (this was the only ok part of our meal). We tried both the Green Tea and the Tree Cake and they were traditional Japanese Sponge Cake which was very good but not exactly what we were expecting as our dessert. 

Our glasses of wine and proseco were also very good - I just wish they offered half bottles at a more convenient price. 

Bottom line is, If you are in old city and looking for a place to dine don't think about it twice.",2018-05-26 12:40:54

The staff was friendly but unhelpful in trying to pick dishes to fit our tastes. Though I'm not sure it would have helped. We tried 6 dishes. The first was basically cold potato salad, pretty much the same as I could pick up at Kroger. The dumplings were bland and flavorless, the curry udon was basically a bowl of mush, and while the trout was good, it could have been trout from any southern restaurant and didn't ring of Japanese flavors at all. The only dish that we enjoyed that had the expected flavoring was the Broccolini with rock shrimp, which was pretty good. 1 for 6 isn't great.

The drinks were fine but not particularly special at 14 bucks each. The waitress described the atmosphere as a neighborhood Japanese pub but it's just another upscale dining establishment in a town full of them. The ambience or atmosphere is the same as any other in town.

Overall, it was not a terrible meal, but not really a good meal either. Just kind of a dud (and an expensive dud at that) in a town full of much better restaurants. We probably wont return.",2018-12-22 21:21:53

We had the tuna tartare & wagyu egg rolls to start. The tuna tartare was delicious- very refreshing & the flavors were amazing. The egg rolls were good- nothing too out of this world but still very tasty. 

We also ordered the Fishtown roll, salmon/avocado rolls & the peppered tuna roll. The Fishtown roll is just the right amount of spice to it. The avocado in the roll was creamy and delicious. I wasn't a fan of the peppered tuna roll but my boyfriend really liked it. 

A few rounds & a few rolls will cost you a few dollars, but definitely worth it for a night out with loved ones.

The place was always standing room only and it was a super treat to go. Over the years this is the place that my family would always go when we got together in Alton. Over the last several months I have been in town quite a bit and have been to Tony's no less than six times in two months. However, every time I go I feel worse about the decision. While the pepperloins are still top-notch I cannot say the same about other items on the menu. The veal is pre-breaded frozen patties and tasted like it was over-cooked after being freezer burned. The spaghetti was cold and over-cooked. The pizza used to be the best anywhere around. For some reason they have changed the crust and now is just so-so. The staff, while usually friendly, are inexperienced and in 6 trips in two months we have never seen the same waiters. Not sure why there seems to be such turnover, but this prevents them from knowing the basics, such as what brands of alcohol are available.

Perhaps the biggest shock here is the recent attempt of Tony's to change the menu format. The create your own pizza/pasta gimmick is not the tradition that I have come to love from this restaurant. 

I will not go as far as to say I will not go back, as I have long loved this place and hope they will return to their former traditional ways.",2015-07-29 01:14:37

I had the spaghetti with meat sauce which was pretty decent. It was a homemade sauce with lots of meat and even chunks of real tomatoes in it. The sauce was not sickeningly sweet and actually tasted pretty decent.

The bread was fresh on the table and the cold antipasti was excellent. Salads were fresh and not from a bag and the dressings were decent.

A loud atmosphere inside and the crowding of the tables inside would be the only downfall. Also, they sat a party of four at a table that at most could fit 2 comfortably.

Service was decent, but not exceptional. There were times our table of four was ignored but drinks seemed to be refilled on a regular basis. Hostess staff was not impressive and seemed to be bored or uninterested and seemed to spend most of the time flirting with the waiters as they ran their tickets next to the host staff.

From my two local Tucson natives, this location is better than the one on Broadway I believe.

I wanted this to be a 4* review but due to the few shortcomings it will have to remain at 3. Not good for groups due to the small, crammed together tables and relatively few booths.

He asked me if i found everything ok

I said yes i found the space heater

He said ""oh is it cold where you are?""

It is 45 degrees for the low in tucson now

Its not 95 degrees anymore

Target OBVIOUSLY has heaters now for a reason

This place is what local legendary places is all about and what Yelp has helped me to discover.  The atmosphere in this area of town is great, somewhat, touristy, but authentic.  The place itself is about as big as a chicken nugget, but the place itself is clean and well organized.  Not only is this fantastic ice cream, but also a full fledged coffee shop with all of the foo foo drinks you could want.  They have some neat little displays and murals on the wall.  One is a fountain that looks as if it's poring into a soda glass from the soda fountain mural.  Quite inventive and cute.  They also have their own T-shirts for sale as well with their famous logo and location of Nashville, TN. I bought one.

Finally, the ice cream itself here is great.  It's not too frozen so it melts while you eat it tastes better.  Doesn't have any of that freezer burn smell or taste to it.  They also have some pretty crazy flavors, including a banana flavored one that went fantastically with a scoop of chocolate.  From what I understand, the ice cream is hand made, and you can taste the quality of the ingredients.

I've eaten at Caviar & Bananas in Charleston, and we had the most amazing sandwich! Their ingredients were fresh, the menu well thought out and even better prepared, and staff was sharp and knowledgable.

At this new Nashville location though, I was missing those things.

The location, layout, decor and ambiance of the restaurant gets an A+, it's one of the nicest in Nashville. But the food, was sadly very disappointing. 

The sandwich we got had Arugula, Egg, Turkey and some other stuff, and it looked amazing... but it had weak and cheap tasting bread, and cheap tasting Turkey. I'm not sure what they use, but it was very disappointing and reminded me of cheap packaged deli meat... especially for the price this was a shock. We also got avocado toast which reads great on the menu, but again thin / cheap bread and an old (dark green) avocado spread that didn't taste fresh at all. We love Avo toast! So this was a bummer.

We also got a Quinoa Kale Veggie Breakfast bowl, but the overall taste of the quinoa and veggies was slightly undercooked and the ingredients weren't prepared to compliment each other. The eggs on top were fine... The staff was very sweet, but wasn't sure what one of the items in the dish even was... they did refund the dish after I talked with them about not enjoying it all, which was awesome. Then i ordered the recommended Chicken Biscuit instead, and it was unfortunately worse. The cheese tasted cheap, the scrambled eggs were soggy, and the chicken was thin and soggy itself, which was crazy. I was actually so surprised because Nashville is a great Fried Chicken town and this was the worst piece of Chicken I've had here... A $3 Chicken biscuit from Chic-Fil-A or Zaxbys would have been much much better taste and better quality chicken (I know, strange)... and this cost $10. Also, I ordered it with Parmesan Potatoes which might have been okay but sadly they came out cold and not fresh... like they had been sitting on a counter for 45 minutes... 

We did order a croissant with strawberry jam and it was amazing! So props there... 

For what this place could be, it has a lot of improvement to make. They have a great foundation, beautiful space, sweet people, and awesome croissants... they just really need to up the game on the quality of the food! And please do!

I find that there is very little not to like about this Wawa. Yeah, they could stock a few more cereals and I really wish they carried Double Stuf Oreos, but they can't have everything... Because then they'd be a grocery store.

They are located in Oliver Square West, next to the Second Cup, KVP, and London Drugs. 

They have a wide variety of organic loaves of breade baked fresh every day, including spelt grain, sprouted, multi seed, pumpernickel (haven't been there early enough to see it yet), challah, yeast-less, and my new favourite, kamut bread. Even my husband who dislikes whole wheat bread loves it. My understanding is that everything is made with a sourdough starter so everything I've tried has a faint sourdough taste, which I love. On Thursdays they take out loaves that were frozen immediately after baking, so that they are just like freshly-baked loaves, and sell them for a discount. I happened to be there on a Thursday and the kamut loaf I bought was just as good as any other day.

They are open non-traditional bakery hours (until 5pm Saturdays for example, when I'd expect it to close earlier, but opens at 9am every day with the exception of being closed on Sundays - I always thought bakeries were open super early?) and there are usually 4-5 types of loaves left when I pop by at the end of the day. If you get a chance to go there on Saturday, be sure to pick up a fresh baguette! Even if it's not Saturday, they are still great - I was there on Monday once and they had baguettes leftover from Saturday on sale, and they were still so soft and fresh that I had to buy one. Delicious. 

They also have other ready-to-eat goodies like pizza and croissants. The croissant I had was flaky and buttery (and large!) though a little dried out, but that was my fault for eating it the next day. There is a small dine-in area of about 3 tables.

They do take credit cards. They are a little more expensive than I'd like it to be but I'm paying for quality, and when I think about it, it's not much more than what I'd pay for a loaf of Wonderbread but this is much, much better. Will be back!",2015-10-02 20:37:56

This is my favorite brewery of all. They are a small batch brewery and usually do not distribute much in the city of Indy except 5-10 places and that too on and off.
However, their tasting room is absolutely worth a visit. Upon entering you are greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff who are more than willing to give you a sample of each of their many creations. Yes, i do call them creations because the way they experiment with beers can only be found in a very few other breweries.
I have been here multiple times to get my growler filled and always get beer from here when my friends are visiting.
I have always found 4-5 that are very good among the 6-10 that they usually sample and i have found out that i am not the only one.
If ever one day i open a brewery of my own i wish for it to be like this. The master brewer is there in person most of the time and the staff is the same.
Great beer and decent prices willing to fill your growlers between Wednesday and Sunday ranging from $10-$24(for the really special brews)

I had the chance to try Tuna Bar for the first time with my husband and my cousin. We were all really impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant (even if we did get blasted with cold air every time someone new entered).

We started with the pork gyoza and fried oysters. When we asked our server how many oysters came in an order, she said 2 per order. We ordered two so that all of us could try an oyster. When the plates came out, there were three gigantic oysters on each of them. So, we really didn't need to order 2 at all. The oysters were OK, nothing special. They mostly tasted like breading. The gyoza were disappointing. They really didn't have much flavor and tasted basically like plain ol' pork sausage.

The actual sushi itself was really good, though. I got some salmon sushi, a yellowtail and chive roll with scallion oil, and a spicy tuna roll. I loved the sushi - it was so tender and melted in your mouth. I also can't say enough good things about the yellowtail/chive/scallion roll. It was...really unique and delicious. I would definitely order that again and advise that you try it for yourself!

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here. I thought their cocktail list left a lot to be desired and that the price for everything was too steep for what you actually got. While I won't be making any grand effort to return, I wasn't dissatisfied with my meal here.",2018-01-29 13:40:05

Nice modern restaurant in Old City located on the main floor of a condo building. Service was excellent on both my visits. You can take your time and enjoy the meal, have a drink or two. Nice laid back atmosphere.

A few appetizers stood out for me - Wagyu beef spring roles, Seaweed salad, Sashimi salad and I loved the Grandmom's wonton soup.  

The Tuna Bar is at its best serving fresh sushi / sashimi.  I was with larger groups so got to try many of the house rolls which were mostly good but I was happiest ordering from the Sushi A La-Carte section of the menu. The fish was incredibly fresh and not the same boring pieces (i.e. Salman, Tuna, Ebi etc....) served at the 100+ sushi restaurants in Philadelphia.   

Loved the variety of fatty tuna options (Toro and Otoro but no Chutoro when I was there - different options available depending on the day), 1-2 Uni choices, Maguro, Kampachi, Striped Bass, Hamachi and Unagi.  

If you want above average sushi options / quality, give the Tuna Bar a try. Prices are above average but to be expected given the variety and quality.

Penn State reunion at a friend's housewarming party in WC. Daylonging beforehand, and finally making it out to the bar around...9pm? 10? Umm...

This place smells like fish when you walk in. Or, rather like a fish tank that needs a good scrub. Upstairs bar = much better. Apparently the thing to get here is Fishbowls, which is basically one of those plastic fishbowls (imagine that.) filled with liquor and mixers. They remind me of the fishbowls at Bar Bleu in State College. My only issue is, just like at my favorite Penn State bar, you are  likely to get diabetes following consumption of this concoction. The blinking lights everywhere was a nice touch.

I ended up ordering Diet Cokes and water here though, since the last thing I needed at this point was more booze. However, just because I don't need something, doesn't mean I didn't want it....

The bartender was a bit rude, as if she was rushed to give us our beers when the bar was not really that busy. When we sat to drink them I quickly noticed why. She was busy dancing, singing, and shaking her butt in an attempt to get a good tip from two men who were there.
I understand when a bar is busy and buzzing you may have to flag down the bartender to refresh your drink. My company wanted another beer and instead of being aware of the patrons she waited over 5 minutes to get her attention to get another beer. Ridiculous. She acted as if it was a bother to have to do her job!
I hear the food here is great. I do plan to go back at least one more time to try their food. Hopefully service will be better this time.
I also noticed how unkept the woman's room was... Sure, people write on the walls and it's an adult establishment, but I would embarrassed to own a place with such awful things written ALL over the stalls in the bathroom. Not to mention there was toilet paper all over the floor and it seemed a bit dirty. On a busy night I can understand the bathroom being overlooked a bit, but not one employee stepped into the bathroom the whole time we were there to even check if it needed to be cleaned a bit. It made it seem that this is the norm. I'd hate to have to be there on a busy night! I couldn't imagine how gross it gets when it's actually busy if thats what it's like when it's not. 
It was also a cold, icy night when we visited and the parking lot was very poorly salted. There were give ice spots near and on the walk way, as well. Very dangerous, especially with inebriated people leaving. I wouldn't be surprised if someone falls and gets seriously hurt one day. If the owners are reading this please do a better salt job in the winter months. People are sue happy now a days.
Thumbs up for use music. I have to say it was a decent variety and more to my taste. No hip hop/rap. Stuck to the classics and that was the best part of my experience there.

The hostess wasn't that friendly and didn't seem to be happy that we were there.  Always a good start....

There are more BIG TV's than any place I've ever visited.  There are almost too many if that's possible.  It was a little annoying that even though all of the TV's were the same size and model they couldn't sync the color adjustments so it made for uncomfortable viewing.  At least the feed was all in sync timing wise.

Our server was very attentive and friendly  I ordered the fish tacos which were very good and my wife had the meatloaf which she also enjoyed.  I had a few draft beers which were quite cold.  I didn't really like the frosty mugs though.  They had too much frost and I ended up with a lot of ice in all three of the beers I ordered.

The other servers that walked by seemed to be going through the motions and were never smiling.  They really made it kind of an uncomfortable environment.  I think if they would smile a little it would go a long way to making the place more enjoyable.

Overall the place just seems too large and not the kind of place I would like to hang out and watch sports.  If you advertise cold beer why does it have to come in an icy cup.  It kind of ruins the beer when there is that much ice floating in it.",2016-01-13 15:14:16

I will say the decor was very nice and inviting. We had several glasses of wine. A decent selection to choose from and several choices of size of pour that allows you a chance to try several different ones if you want to  experiment. 
The issue was the inconsistent service, absent-minded and slow. A little bit after we arrive and party of 20+ arrived. It looked like a group from a local CBD office. That group sucked up all the service. I comment to my wife we should probably order something before the large table because it may overwhelm the kitchen. After a few moments we order some duck fat Fries and a duck confit Flatbread. We were initially told that the duck Confit wasn't available then told it just wasn't ready yet.  So we went with the fries. Low and behold several flatbreads including a duck confit flatbread we delivered to the large table less than 5 minutes later. Our fries to 20min and we well fries. Not special.  Then we ordered a different flatbread. 25 min later I flagged down the server to ask where it was. Apparently a mistake was made so he said he would rush out another order.  20 min later a server comes out with a flatbread and wanders ultimately placing the flatbread on the large table of 20+ and I can hear them asking among themselves who ordered it?.......well no one because it was ours. So I flagged again and told it would be rushed again and yes, 20 min it finally arrived. And well it was underwhelming at best. A flatbread is a simple square/rectangular pizza on a thin crackery/crispy crust. How do you mess that up?  Was bland. We just finished up and left. We were there to enjoy some wine on a Friday evening so we stayed for that reason. Then it just became comical. I don't believe we will be returning anytime soon.",2018-09-22 22:50:01

Pizza was very good , thick crust good crunch not overly doughy. 
Sauce was actually balanced well not overly sweet nor acidic.   An abundance of well distributed creamy mozza not overly oily either.  
My only small critique would be I would like more garlic in the sauce.  
I'd put them in my pending top 5  best Sicilian , pending on account I will revisit it and see if they are consistent with quality and taste. Yes I take pizza that seriously!

I decided to be less predictable this time and I get the corn and crab bisque and the fried catfish Lafitte lunch special which came with sausage jambalaya.

The waitress brought out my entree before my corn and crab bisque. I had intended the bisque to be my appetizer, but I guess I should have mentioned that, The catfish was interesting. It was topped with red sauce (which the waitress mentioned ahead of time) and it was fried nicely. The jambalaya was okay, but didn't really dazzle me.

The corn and crab bisque was just okay, as well. It didn't taste the way other bisque I have had in the past tasted. I don't know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. My dad got the shrimp and pasta and wasn't that into it either. He was so not into it that he let me take his leftovers home so I could eat it later. When I tried it, all it was was flavorless pasta and overcooked shrimp- disappointing.

Our waitress was beyond sweet and made sure that we were happy with everything. Like I said, this spot has only been open a month so I expect them to work out the issues and do okay.

And I was somehow charged a 20% tip as a default for my forgotten order before I even got my main course when I was planning  to leave cash tip. Thankfully I noticed it before I tipped double on severely neglected service and subpar food. 

The food was not good. The beet salad although sorta pretty came out filled with morose chunks of beets that could have choked a cow. But HEY the underlaying sauces made it look pretty...although didn't really help the taste. They should really add some greens as a base and ummm carve the beets into something a human could choke down. 

Then the main course which was a flatbread margarita pizza took 40 min after the salad. Obviously forgotten the pizza came out cold and slopped together on the fly. Obviously waiter error and he would not acknowledge it. 

WINE BAR: To top it off their wine selection by the bottle is severely overpriced  and the tap wines by the glass ...up to bottle are basic and uninteresting. This is the sort of place that could easily boast a high end list but instead they gobble up your dollars assuming you are a tourist or on a business tab $$.

This tap room has over 10 beers on tap constantly, offering growler fills, bullet fills (half a growler) and pints to enjoy. Bier Brewery is just that, though - a tap room with limited seating, no food or other beers available. I'm OK with that - their beer makes up for all the rest. And many times they have food trucks out front to fill your belly with.

I love that they aren't located downtown like many of our other local breweries (but I'll be honest, I love it most because they're convenient for me). I hope that someday they grow enough that they could expand their building - I've been when it was standing room only and barely room to stand at that.

Gluten-free pasta? I never knew that existed in any restaurants. Apparently that was my friend's reaction too when she saw it on the menu. I don't know much about the gluten allergy other than what she has told me. Basically what it boils down to is -- if she eats any wheat products, it kills the lining of her stomach. Eww...... needless to say she was pretty friggin' excited.

4 of went. Seated upon arrival with our reservation, our server was a bit slow to getting to us and our orders. I don't remember her name or much else other than we didn't get served as promptly as we would have liked with our first order of drinks or our food orders until about 15 minutes of us being seated. I thought this was a bit ridiculous considering we didn't even get our waters immediately either.

After our long wait, she brought  out our complimentary bread and to take our orders. I decided on the half portion of their Tortellini Roberto aka doughnut shaped pasta stuffed with pork and chicken in a cream sauce with peas and ham. Delish. Also, a spinach salad with mandarin oranges,walnuts, red onion which I had removed, and a raspberry - balsamic vinaigrette. The salads are not included in the pricing with the pasta dishes, however if you order an entree, it is included.

The fact the salads are not included really doesn't make a whole lot of difference. The half portions and full portions are all so decently priced and it is so good! I recommend getting a half portion of the pasta and a salad to accompany it if you are on a budget and want something filling. 

I was so surprised on how cheap the pasta dishes were! Nothing is over $13 for full orders of the pastas, and just like I did, you can order a half salad and half order of pasta and leave with satisfied without feeling like you broke the bank. Once you get into the entrees that is a different story. You are going to be in the $20-$30 price range. Ultimately, you can spend as little as $6 on a fulfilling meal or you can wine and dine as if it's a upscale restaurant and leave with a $50 tab. I love how it suits to all wallet sizes.

We waited a long time, yes, but I give this place 4 stars for the ambiance, accommodating menu prices, and multiple pasta and mix 'n' match options. Perfect for family night or date night. Again, kudos for the gluten-free options!",2011-10-25 05:23:04

It was a beautiful day and there was outdoor seating available, but they also take away part of the wall to the inside to merge some of the outdoor seating with the in. 

Now on to the food. All in all we ordered Grandmom's wonton soup, the Soba Noodles, and the Wentz, Sindy, Rittenhouse, Dragon, and Spicy Scallop Rolls. Everything was delicious! Now we're no Japanese cuisine experts but my boyfriend said that was the best wonton soup he's ever had. The soba noodles were very flavorful and tender and all of the rolls were to die for. Every roll was unique and delicious but we agreed our favorite was the Sindy roll. Instead of it being wrapped in soy paper or seaweed it's wrapped in thinly shaved tuna. Something we had never seen before. 

My boyfriend had only casually mentioned it was my birthday in front of the host but the host was keen enough to pick up on that so the chef made us a small raw fish appetizer that was to die for and since we hadn't saved room for dessert our server, Dori, brought us over two small dessert drinks before we left. Very thoughtful and sweet on everyone's part!

Diamond Virgin Hair Company is unprofessional and rude. I have never experienced such callous disregard from any well-known company. Mayven and HerImports are accessible and communicative with me. Even Aliexpress has excellent follow-up. The Diamond Virgin Hair Company team runs away and hides when a critique is made. Their product is not perfect. They are selling hair that is grown from other human beings. It will never be perfect, and some customers will have varying experiences while wearing your product. That should be expected, and there should be a plan in place to deal with such occurrences. The hair that I received sheds A LOT. The wefts are intact, the hair was not bleached, and it has been routinely cowashed. I have been experiencing this problem from day one. I reached out to them, and they never responded. 

Diamond Virgin Hair Company's lack of communication speaks volumes about the sustainability of this company. However, you all cannot negate the concerns of customers after accepting payment. They have no right to treat customers in this manner, and they cannot continue this practice. This behavior is why Diamond Hair Company is not number #1, and it must be corrected if they ever wish to be. 

The BBB must investigate these types of companies. Diamond Virgin Hair Company pays reviewers of social media to lure unsuspecting customers to their website. This company communicated with me about purchasing hair, but when the conversation became an inquiry about the quality of the hair that I received, the communicated ceased. There was no follow-up for over one year; that is customer abandonment. These practices need to be investigated and stopped.

Hubs used to live in Edmonton and knows the city fairly well so after reading some great reviews I knew we needed to seek it out.  As the name implies Roast is both a coffeehouse and wine bar.  They are however separated into two unique spaces.

Immediately we loved the ambiance and decor of the coffeehouse.  Spacious & Airy it felt very comfortable.  The staff behind the counter were uber friendly and helpful.  They alone deserve 5 stars each for outstanding customer service.  They were chatty and very accommodating with our kids which also impressed us.

We picked up a few items to try, the cookie topped doughnut, maple bacon cinnamon bun, cookies and a pain au chocolat.  Also indulged in some hot cocoa (kids), a cappuccino for me and hubs tried the salted caramel latte.  Everything was heavenly but the salted caramel latte was the big winner for me and well the maple bacon cinnamon bun for hubs (anything with bacon, right?).  They also had a Bacon Latte on the menu but were out of the candied bacon so we didn't get to try (this time).

The next day we stopped in on our way out of town.  The same friendly peeps were working behind the counter and remembered us.  We picked up some more goodies and coffee (this time I got the salted caramel latte - heaven) and left a very satisfied family indeed.

Two visits over the winter. Tried different angus burgers. Delivered as promised.

After making the reservation and realizing we weren't able to preview the prix fixe menu, I decided to contact the restaurant since my boyfriend has a shellfish allergy and this can often be a problem with sushi. I called, no answer. So I messaged them via Facebook. I explained his allergy and asked if this would be issue with the menu and their exact response was ""...confirmed with management and there will be no shellfish on tonight's menu..."" (See pic) 

Great, so we went. As soon as we sat down and looked at the menu we realized almost half of it included shrimp aka SHELLFISH (see V-day menu pic). Now maybe they were unaware that shrimp is shellfish? Or maybe they were just too lazy to actually check when I inquired, but either way, it's pretty inexcusable to ignore someone's food allergies and risk a health scare. What if we had asked if a dish included shellfish and my boyfriend had eaten it due to their ignorance? We would have ended up at the hospital. 

I'm giving three stars because our waiter did his best to accommodate us once we were already seated and expecting a decent meal. The sushi roll  that he subbed for the 6th course (didn't have a name, his creation) was pretty quality and we did really enjoy it.

And then with that I had ""nutter butter"" which was legit nutter butter flavored ice cream (like not vanilla, not even just peanut butter, but fully nutter butter) with HUGE chunks of nutter butter cookies and chunks of peanut butter. And the waffle cone was homemade but like it was legit probably a like super special secret homemade recipe for it cause it tastes soooooooo much better than a normal waffle cone and like had a different texture cause it was like a little thinner and more crispy and tasted closer to a real waffle than normal waffle cones do. My cone was handed to me with a big break in it, but the ice cream was hard enough that it actually didn't melt without my tongue licking it, so the break surprisingly wasn't a problem at all.

Fortunately for us, the friendly folks at Bier charge a lot less. 

Make a u-turn right out of the parking lot of those ""other"" Indianapolis breweries and head to Bier for some of the best craft beer this state has to offer. 

I've been complaining for quite a while about the lack of creativity shown by most breweries around here. The same beers over, and over, and over.  You can throw that tired formula out the window now. These guys are bringing it with much more than the usual IPA, wheat, amber, and porter. 

You like dunkles? How about two different dunkles on draft, one made with rye? Will that work for you? How about a smoked brown, a Belgian pale, or a stout that was recently named the best in the state at a local competition? Oh, cream ale is your thing?

I ordered a frozen coffee which they blend themselves and it was deliciously strong and perfectly frozen.  YUMMERS.  I also got a taste of their Red Velvet flavor which is something I'll be SURE to order when I go back again.

I love when we have our family gathering here.
Our servers were friendly and very accommodating for my vegetarian needs.

They went up and beyond to make our family feel welcome while having very delicious food.
Every year we gather here to talk and laugh with excellent food and adult drinks.( we  are always kicking it old school)

On our visited  we placed about 20 orders of food with delicious drinks too.

I love charm of the old school Italian Resturant with many amazing rooms for your gathering and more. 
In the front of the restaurant there is an opening area for those who don't have a private party.

Everyone was so happy with all of the food and drinks.
I love the private parking lots.

Thank you for continually to sharing the love for our family on every visit. 
This restaurant open their doors in 1949 while still upholds  their amazing excellent customer experience here. I will return.

We received so many compliments on the music, and people loved the box of wigs and other props that Rob provided.

It's so clear the Rob has fun and loves what he does, and he's great at it. I couldn't imagine a better person to have worked with as the entertainment for our wedding. If you're in the market for a phenomenal DJ/MC for your event, Rob is absolutely your guy.",2017-04-05 03:54:56

The Fishers Freedom Festival helps me meet my wholesomeness quota, and the best part is that it's really fun and has great food. 

This festival is typically the weekend before the 4th of July, and it is very popular, so expect lots of people! 

Parking isn't too bad, though, and you have a couple options. You can either pay $5 (cash) to park in a designated parking area near Roy G. Holland park. Or you can try your luck parking in the neighborhood that is around the park. We found a parking space in the neighborhood pretty quickly.

For a city festival, the food options are really spectacular. We got a ""giant taco"" (which was really just a burrito), corn dogs, kettle corn, lemon shake ups, soft serve ice cream and sno-cones. But we could have gotten one of the many other things to eat, including gyros, nachos, ribs, turkey legs, brisket sandwiches, cotton candy, elephant ears ... you know, the usual fair food. The things we got were pretty inexpensive, too. 

There are many activities for kids, including bounce houses, and of course, the playground.

I figured that it would be best to take it in to the local store, right?  WRONG!  The Nook rep there was not helpful and rude.  She basically told me that I must have done something to scratch my Nook, that it was my fault, and that she could not help me.  She admitted that she had never seen my issue before, but refused to do anything to help at all.  When I got home (obviously I was upset - I had only had my Nook for a month, and I was upset that B&N was not going to stand behind their product), I Googled my issue, and what do you know - it is a very common issue, a known problem with my particular Nook.  I called the local store again - once again got terrible customer service - asked to speak to the manager, who apparently was not available.  I asked for the manager to return my call - the rep on the line did not even ask for my name.  I asked who would be returning my call - ""Jeff.""  Jeff who? I asked - ""Jeff Peckman"".  Do you think that Jeff Peckman returned my call?  NOPE.  Terrible service - I will not be shopping at that store ever again.

Bier Brewery is neat because they hold casual pint nights where people can come and socialize and drink pints of Bier beers.

That obviously doesn't affect the rating of TKO, but honestly, I was not hugely impressed by Lance, the DJ who replaced our original guy.  He was very nice and kind enough to let my neurotic self give him a detailed list of what we wanted played--accompanied by a CD of songs we didn't think they'd have... and I know we checked the ""NOT over-the-top DJ"" box when selecting what type of DJ we were interested in, but a *little* personality wouldn't have killed the guy.  

So the wedding reception had good music, but I didn't think the sound quality was that great--this could have been an acoustics problem with our venue and not the blame of TKO, but Lance could've turned up the volume a bit.  And been sort of energetic.  Maybe smiled a little...  Yeah, he was kind of a dud.

We had a reservation and were seated in the upstairs area of the restaurant after we walked in. Our waitress was LOVELY. She walked us through pretty much the whole menu as well as explaining some of the drink options as well. 

I started with a sake that the restaurant had on tap, which was wonderful. my husband tried one of their cocktails and then stuck with his favorite Manhattan after that. 

We started with the okonomiyaki (a Japanese pancake, at Green Pheasant made with ham, bacon, scallops, potatoes, and various traditional okonomi toppings). It was good, but not my favorite thing we ate. Next we tried the shumai (at Green Pheasant, made with lobster and spot prawn - and served with clover ponzu) - these were okay, but definitely my least favorite thing we ordered (they had a slightly strange flavor to me, but that may be because I'm so used to shumai made with shrimp only). 

Next we had the spicy crab noodles (with crab butter, sweet red crab, and tobanjan), which were very good. Lots of crab on the dish, and it was just the right amount of heat! 

But the Ikinari steak was my favorite of the appetizers or entrees we ordered! The steak was American skirt steak with corn and onion and miso brown butter and j sauce, served in a hot hot hot sizzle plate like is traditional at the Japanese steak restaurant chain Ikinari (picture a fajita platter at a Tex Mex restaurant). The steak was great (perfectly cooked); the corn and onions were charred where they had touched the hot sizzle plate; and the miso brown butter was just the right richness for the steak. I'd come back to Green Pheasant just to eat this again. A great dish.

But we didn't stop there. We ordered two of the desserts as well. I ordered the ginger creme brulee which was SENSATIONAL (I might be back at Green Pheasant again soon - I want to sit at the bar, order some sake or shochu, and eat the Ikinari steak and the ginger creme brulee. Quite simply one of the best desserts I've had recently. The ginger flavor was amazing, and the creme brulee was so smooth. I LOVED IT. My husband has about 10x the sweet tooth I do and he ordered the tempura fried slice of chocolate cake. I tried a teeny tiny bite, and it's just WAAAAAAY too rich and sweet for me, but he enjoyed it (definitely for people who love sweet, rich desserts only). 

We had a couple more drinks (including a shochu cocktail that was DELICIOUS). The service was excellent, and the restaurant pretty nice (I do think sitting downstairs is probably nicer, because upstairs is pretty sparse compared to the decor on the main level). We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I think we'll be back.",2019-02-28 20:26:35

Some examples - ordered a Basil Hayden bourbon on the rocks. Listed at $15 on menu. Getting the check, I noted it was $18.  The bartender said it was $15 in a mixed drink at 1 ounce but on the rocks they charged $18 for 1.5 ounce.  Two things.  Deceptive to list lower price if you can charge a higher one and secondly, who the heck serves 1.5 ounces of liquor?  I have lived on the east coast for years and know the average pour is 2 ounces.  Another thing is we were told they serve inferior grade fish within the rolls compared to the sushi or sashimi...strange but in the hundreds of Japanese restaurants I have been to, I have never heard that!

So many of the other DJ's were insisting we sign up that same day and/or offered DJ services and photo-booth and photography, etc. We like that TKO was not pushy and also focused on doing one thing right...DJ'ing. We met with them at their office prior to our wedding and were again impressed at their level of professionalism. 

Andrew was the DJ at our wedding and reception and he was AMAZZZING. The processional song ended up running out because my flower girl took too long to walk down the aisle. Andrew was so quick to catch on and seamlessly extended the processional song so that no one would find out. We were requesting many international songs (Persian) to be played at our wedding...Andrew did an AMAZING job with mixing them in with the English songs and at the right times. Our dance floor was crowded ALL NIGHT!!! We were so happy that we decided to go with TKO and we felt incredibly happy with our DJ Andrew.

There are many DJ services out there. If you are looking for a DJ who knows what they are doing and will be on time, professional, and fun then TKO is the DJ for you. All the other DJ companies appear to be jack of all trades but master of none. TKO is the master of DJ'ing! They run a professional business and will give you excellent quality service.

Since we had a 5pm reservation we were able to partake in their happy hour specials which included drinks and $5-$7 sushi rolls. It was a great deal considering the quality and ambience. For the sushi we went with the classics spicy tuna, spicy salmon and the salmon avocados. They were able to accommodate for my friend's wheat allergy but giving her gluten free soy sauce. The waiter was very patient and thorough with making sure my friend did not encounter any wheat products. Besides our sushi, my other friend got the chicken dumplings and the avocado ginger salad, which were both excellent. We also happened to come on a particularly beautiful day so the doors were open and they had a photographer take pictures of their new menu items. One of which is this stunning cocktail called 1912 which is inspired by the cherry blossoms in DC. The bartender sprinkled hibiscus dust on top and garnished it with beautiful flowers. It was light and refreshing and not too sweet. It also doesn't hurt that it is a beautiful work of art!
Lastly we had our sweet ending with the dark chocolate sesame ice cream. The chocolate was overpowering the sesame to be honest, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. My only qualm was that the bowl and plates are a bit uneven so it's not ideal for serving. Otherwise, this is a must try!",2018-03-30 00:49:13

More of a ""nano"" brewery..than ""micro""...as their beer is in small batches..which means they may not have what you want for long....also..if you find a beer you like...chances are you won't see it again !  While this poses a bit of a conundrum for a hoppy IPA creature of habit such as moi...it also forces me to try different brews that I might not normally consider....

For instance....

I am not typically fond of Belgian type brews...the yeasts usually give the beer a ""bananna-ish"" taste....at least according to my taste buds, however..the Belgian here was delicious, smooth, very complex in that there were a bunch of flavors that showed up individually and collectively....just yummy !

I am by no means an expert, and happily quaff the most egregious of macro brews...but the beer here is fantastic.

For some reason we come to this location about once a week and have a neutral to terrible experience each time. The store is clean and organized, I think the stockers and display team are great however the checkout staff up front is horrendous. The checkout team is made up of cocky teens and clueless, miserable 50 year-olds that didn't plan properly for retirement and are forced to work. There are about 15 checkout lines but rarely is more than one manned, while multiple (up to 5, I counted) carefree staff members urge you to use the self checkout. Customers must endure the headache of scanning/weighing their own produce, wait to get ID checked for alcohol or superglue, bag all purchases and struggle to figure out how to scan/run a coupon as a check or use a finicky gift card.

What caused me to write this review was our experience yesterday on 4/10/2019. My wife, myself and our newborn baby went to target to purchase some medical supplies, infant formula and some groceries. Not one register was manned but several employees were twiddling their thumbs around the self checkout stations. We were told by an older female employee to use self checkout and we declined and explained we were purchasing formula with complicated coupons as well as some beer. She opened a register just for us and seemed very unfamiliar with the workings of a digital cash register.She tried for about 10 minutes to run a check-type coupon to no avail. She called for help and I watched about 3 employees do an about face and flee the other direction. She and who I assume was the manager finally figured it out after I had walked outside due to our infant screaming. The best part was two other customers got in line behind us with completely fully carts, and were told by employees to use the self checkout. I really hope the checkout team does not get absorbed into other store teams when this place closes.Not surprising this location is being closed due to falling sales.",2019-04-13 09:01:50

When it came out the oven The cruton in the salad was so overwhelming with burnt taste. My little brother order the mama trio, and that lasagna with wine, was so overwhelming with the bitterness of the wine, to the point he couldn't eat it, because they did not reduce the wine down.i will never ever go back to this place.

I finally had a chance to pop in and ordered the japchae with anticipation. I think it was just under $9, a bit pricy in my opinion for a vegetarian japchae with a small scoop of rice. It didn't have that much flavor, to be honest.

My significant other got the truffle mac n cheese, which he was all about. I wasn't that into it, but as you can see, I'm kind of a turd.

I even read a few articles that this was supposed to have some of the best ice cream in the nation. That's a lot of hype to live up to. But I have very rarely come across ice cream that I haven't, to some degree, cared for. So, obviously, I was going to try this place out.

It's not impressive from the outside, or the inside for that matter. It's pretty small actually. And the employee's are unfriendly. But, I would get tired, real quick, of people asking me for sample after sample and taking their sweet time to order, even when there is a huge line. So, hindsight is 20/20. 

Anyway, there are a ton of flavors to choose from, which I always appreciate from creameries. Especially ones that hand make their own product. I ended up getting the Tennessee Fudge flavor, as did my counter-part. It seemed to be a vanilla base with copious amounts of fudge folded in. The other flavors were traditional favorites, simple staples, nothing really off the wall. That Tennessee Fudge was delicious, though. I would order the hell out of that again.

The menu offers several traditional Italian choices and prices are fair; about $20 will get you an entree that includes a salad and side of pasta or vegetables. The dishes were executed fairly well though I have seen better. The veal parmigiano was tasty but perhaps a bit one-note, and the tender meat was not as melt-in-your-mouth as it could've been. The shrimp scampi were all cooked perfectly in a lovely, well-balanced butter sauce. However, the side of pasta was on the salty side. Unfortunately, the tiramisu was the most disappointing part of the meal - not enough rum and too thick a cream took away from the lightness of the dessert.

But, while Ricardo's may lack slightly in their food, it certainly makes up in atmosphere - a solid 5 stars. The tables are spaced out enough to allow privacy and the dining area is relatively small, which creates just the perfect amount of ambient noise. Service was also excellent; our waiter was polite, timely, and welcoming. All of this made for a clean, classy environment (or dare I say...romantic?!).

The hostess sat us down and seemingly forgot about us, as a server didn't come around to get our drink orders for another 20 minutes. They weren't even busy. The server was not friendly and wasn't familiar with the drink or food menus, she didn't want to answer questions that my father had about the menu. Our food came out quickly but was not good. In a party of 6, half of us did not get what we ordered, and the food we received was all either way overcooked, or undercooked. My husband felt that his chicken wings tasted off, and has been sick to his stomach for the last two hours. None of us had been here before tonight and it's really unlikely that we'll be back.

There are 2 very distinct reasons on why this place isn't receiving a 4 or 5-star rating. The size of the shop and how sweet the ice cream is. 

This ice cream shop is tiny which is surprising. This shop is right in downtown. Lots of foot traffic. Tourists galore. Luckily on a Friday evening it wasn't too packed when we arrived. We didn't have to wait in line at all. It is Autumn though. On a hot day I can't imagine how packed this place gets. It's almost like they expect you to order your treat and leave. They do have a couple of tables, but it's not an inviting location. In particular... during my visit there was this creepy guy sitting close by that kept staring at me while I ate my cone. Stop it dude! Just stop.

I ended up ordering the Superhero flavor. It's 3 different flavors(red, whitish yellow, and blue). I believe it's cherry, maybe banana/vanilla, and blueberry ice cream. I normally wouldn't order some bizarre flavor like that, but this time it sounded perfect! My ice cream was good, but it was too sweet. I only ordered 1 scoop in a cone. I was so full that I wasn't able to eat the cone. It seems too sweet might be a recurring theme for this ice cream shop. The great thing about this ice cream is that it's extra thick. 

The other oddity is that I was hoping for an ice cream/coffee shop perfect combination store as the name(Mike's Ice Cream & Coffee Bar) suggests. Coffee definitely takes a back seat to the ice cream here. They have plenty of hot coffee drinks, but you know that feeling when you walk into a coffee shop. That yummy mmmhmm feeling with your brain yearning for coffee... you don't get that here. You feel more like a kid in a candy shop but ordering ice cream instead.

Next time I'm in Nashville I'll stop in here to try another flavor. Truth be told... I might be spoiled by local Louisville favorite, Comfy Cow!",2015-10-13 14:25:13

Lets start by saying I just love Lafayette Square. I love the atmosphere. We were seated in kind of a corner with a good view of the vacuum and extra chairs but I tried not to pay attention. 

As previous 'yelpers' have mentioned, the service was a little slow but nothing I couldn't handle (see Lewelyn's review). Our drinks were never empty it just took some time for our waiter to take drink orders and food orders etc... but then again I think he was the only waiter on shift tonight. 

From other reviews and the raves about the lasagna, I decided to go with that. It literally was a mound-ful of cheesy goodness (thanks for the good review Emily B.). There was just enough sauce and meat to make it delicious. We also ordered the toasted ravioli. The sauce was amazing. Nice consistency and delicious flavor in the ravioli. The fiance for the seafood cannelloni. He says 'it was awesome'. He said you can def. tell there were good portions of lobster, shrimp, and scallops. It was fried but not over fried to where it has that complete grease flavor. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the sauce was a white wine lemon sauce---perfect for dipping bread. 
The house dressing had the perfect blend of sweetness as well.
The overall decor in the restaurant was lacking a bit but the lighting was still enough to set a romantic mood (when you don't look at the vacuum). There does need to be updated decor and maybe some paint touch ups on the wall. Overall a good experience and very easy on the wallet.

Each beer me and my dad chose were good. My favourite was the stout. The food was just okay. Ordered the smokehouse pizza and the crafty fries. The pizza had a good taste however it was really greasy (I had to put my tide pen to work). The fries were okay. Maybe if the grease from the pizza didn't overpower the taste of the fries, I would have nicer things to say about them.

dDldOChirXdRLiVAE69i5Q,OfddPlzVNLSwlOTaeBGZKA,7PDi_iyik3jraDAzWwwR4Q,1.0,1,0,0,"I have had a credit card dispute pending since 9/10. A dispute that I thought had been resolved. The credit was issued. THEN I get a letter in DECEMBER asking for more data. The letter was dated 12/9, but not received until the 17th. It wants me to verify that the merchandise was returned and it wants me to contact the vendor, AGAIN.

While I know that credit disputes take time, it seems that Chase went way overboard in the amount of time it gave Metro PCS to respond to the dispute. 

To add insult to injury, I contacted Metro PCS. They promised to call back and of course, did not. I mailed off a copy of a receipt that said 'DELIVERY INSURED"" with the form Chase sent. I called Chase to let them know that I had tried to call the vendor and I had mailed more documentation to them. And what do they do? Some a-hole was so anxious to get that file off their desk, that they CLOSED the file BEFORE the date specified in their own letter! The next day I got another letter saying the matter was closed and that I would be re-billed. WHAT?

I called the rep who sent me the new letter. By the time I was finished talking to her, I felt as though I was being interrogated as a criminal. She disputed everything that I said, including the USPS receipt that I sent to them saying ""DELIVERY INSURED!"" In fact, I became so frustrated talking to her that I could feel myself wanting to cry. And I am not a cry baby. She offered no recourse. She would not even tell me where she was sending the file. She made it sound like that was just gonna be that. OH YEAH? So this is the purpose of this review. I want people to be forewarned about how some reps behave in the credit dispute services dept. You know, the department that is supposed to be helping defend you against being taken advantage of by a sleazy company like Metro (Ghettro) PCS. Instead of help, all I got were justifications as to why they could not ""make the vendor pay."" Excuse me? I could not believe what I was hearing.

I've never had a disputed charge encounter become adversarial with a company that is supposed to be servicing ME before.

Protect yourself, people. Save every shred of paper. Document every name. Cuz you will need it to defend yourself. Don't accept anything less than what is right. Know your rights. Send follow up letters when you talk to people. It's the only way. People lie on the phone to get rid of you. If you don't get satisfaction, tell them you will contact the FTC, your congressman, alert the media and report the issue in social network forums.  

For the record, I rarely dispute any charges. But this taught me a lesson. The fact that credit card companies offer a dispute system is NO guarantee that any purchase issue will be resolved to your satisfaction. So caveat emptor. Buyer beware. I will never again rely upon any credit card company to be my advocate in a purchase transaction. EVER. I will not ""shop with confidence"" any more, no matter what any credit card company advertiser says. 

I feel so strongly about consumer advocacy that I will offer anyone who contacts me templates of some of the letters that I have written to resolve disputes that have worked in the past. There are no guarantees, but usually written letters get results. Do not rely upon phone calls. Document everything you do and say, ad nauseam.

I will post updates to this situation as they occur. For reference about the dispute, see http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=OfddPlzVNLSwlOTaeBGZKA&q=Metro+PCS or find the Metro PCS review in the L.A. area.",2010-12-30 19:04:45

On a cool and rainy winter night it felt kind of drafty and chilly. But we were excited to check out this new place. 
The menu is simple and split up into two sections: cold and hot. Since it was so chilly we only got one thing from the cold menu: the Tsukemono. I think of Tsukemono as pickled vegetables and was expecting such, but instead got a mixed greens salad with some chunks of raw fish in it. The chunks of raw fish were quite good, and though it seemed like scraps from other raw fish plates, we enjoyed it. I love scraps and not wasting!
We then moved onto our hot plates. When we asked our waitress about the order and timing she promised all of our dishes would not arrive at the same time and she was right. They all arrived at the same time except for the one larger dish we had ordered. Eh, a few kinks to a new restaurant.  I understand. 
The dishes:
Dan Dan shishito. I love Dan dan Mian the spicy Sichuan noodle dish and I like shishito peppers so we got this. It was a competition on the plate: the shishito vs the dan dan. There is not room in the bowl for two such strong flavors! Neither won. 
We then got the kinoko: warm mushrooms with finely grated cheese on top. A salty warm cheesy dish which felt good on a drafty evening. A small bowl for $13 or so but who's counting?
The star of the night was the stuffed chicken wings: the tebasaki gyoza. The bone removed from the meaty half of the wing and a shrimp toast mixture stuffed in, it was warm, savory and my favorite. Three wings on a plate if you were wondering how many to order for a table. 
Finally we got the trout: a good idea of a whole trout lightly fried with cold slaw and three little steamed bread pieces to make your own little baozi
of fish and slaw. Fish was a little overdone and slaw was a little mayo-naisey for our taste. I think we would have preferred a sharper crisper more vinegar heavy slaw. 
Overall, I think it has potential, but needs to work on some execution and pricing. I mean $22 for a bowl for potato udon? Oy!",2018-12-01 15:37:04

That's what really makes the place special.  Otherwise, its a decent neighborhood bar - not quite the dive others describe it as, though you'l never mistake it for an elitist establishment.  

The bar is spread between two floors.  Downstairs has a corner bar vibe, upstairs more of a sports bar.  The bar also has a deck upstairs.   Like the other bars in the area, Sharky's opted to put ""good looking girl"" ahead of ""fast and attentive"" in their qualifications for bar tender, though the service isn't bad.  Unlike House of Brews, Taylors, and Geets, the bar tenders are more milfy hot than out of your league tart hot.   Ordinary beer prices are what you would expect for a bar of this kind. The beer specials tend to be on nasty Coors.  They frequently have booze brand reps giving away trinkets.  

 But in the end, its the crowd and the music choice is what makes the place.  Bob and Doug's is ghetto.  Geets is more middle age and kind of lame.  House of brews is older and more stuffy.  Taylors is d-bag central.  But Sharky's is a house full of rocker kids.  Since that's my style (even if I'm a little old for it), that makes Sharky's the place for me.",2014-02-15 01:46:25

My kids loved every single detail about this place (1,3). They played for 3.5 hours, which is exactly 2.5 hours than we have ever managed to be anywhere else!!!

Besides that....The food was awesome. I love wings, and their wings were top notch. I got my wings breaded like I would at Hooters, and their breading is nice and crisp. Their sauces are good although not as many to choose from as Buffalo Wing Wings. In always better than Wings, Etc. I liked their wings above all wings because of the breading. You can get them without breading too.

They have two beers that are made for them. One they claimed was like a Blue Moon, but Blue Moon is better. The other is a brown ale. Both were good. They advertise 29 degree cold beer. I had to be that temperature, because it was slightly slushy at the top. I would rather the beer just be in the high 30's. No need to have ice in me beer.

They have TVs at all the booths from what I could tell. It was really neat to watch a college football game at my table. The restaurant sound system was turned to play that game over the speaker system. On a side note, not all the tables were turned to the same channel. Not sure if you can get it changed for your table or not. 

The ambiance of the place looks like the inside of a log cabin. It has a Ron Swanson vibe from Parks and Recreation. Long tables have axes dividing them. Some chairs are made of of branches. Tables are made of slabs of wood. The walls are decorated with pin up girl calendars and beer related materials. The ladies looked very pretty in their outfits.

The brass hardware paired with bright teal chairs and elevated ceilings gave an upscale, opulent ambiance that I love and is the perfect setting for a fantastic Friday night meal. We met some friends here for the first time and decided to order a lot of things and share. We ordered cocktails, mine was a lemongrass drink with gin that was delicious and the rest of the table had cold sake. For our cold starter we had the wedges which typically I'm not a big fan of a giant stalk of lettuce as a general rule, but this one was cut up into smaller pieces with a hibachi dressing and crispy onions which were delicious. For the warm courses we ordered two kinds of gyozas, one being the stuffed chicken wings which were unlike anything I've ever had and incredibly interesting. They were warm and flavorful and stuffed with a blend of what I think was shrimp and other seasonings. It's hard to describe, but just get them. We also had the dan dan shishito peppers which I have to order whenever they are on a menu and were very good. I think my favorite dish of the night was the spicy crab noodles. They were good because they were actually spicy for a spice lover, and rich but not too heavy unlike other crab noodles I've had. They were incredible and melted in my mouth. I completely hogged the dish and was not as generous with them as I normally am when ordering shared plates. We also sampled a pork special that was great and had a really good sashimi which I think was the walu on the cold menu.

I have to agree with the other reviewers - friendly staff, clean facility, the free breakfast included do it yourself waffles, oatmeal, plenty of fruit, yogurt, sweet rolls, sausage and eggs.  You could really go nuts for the breakfast buffet.

The pool is too small to do laps in.  The workout facility was small (free weights, (missing one 30 lb weight?) two treadmills, a recumbent bike and a stepper), but worked out fine to burn the calories I was picking up at meetings.

My biggest headache - the room was quiet, but the heat was L O U D and cycled on and off a lot.  Like wake you awake in the middle of the night loud, and was high on the temperature as well.  The thermostat read 69 degrees F, but it was more like 80 in the room.  To compromise, I set it down to 64, which made it comfortable and kept the darn heat from starting up too many times during the night (and waking me up again and again.)

This place has a good location - it's right next to Exelon's HQ, which is handy if you work for that company. Otherwise, you're driving to get into town.

The fried oysters we received came with very little sauce and when we bit into it there was a squirt of seawater and kind of fishy taste to it.

The J&J roll was well seasoned and each roll had a good balance of flavors and sauce. However, when you eat the fish laying on top, there was almost no flavor and almost had a hard texture to it. Something one wouldnt expect when eating raw fish.

The omakase came out with 8 pieces instead of 10 pieces as stated previously. The excuse we received was because we got to eat Otoro (fatty tuna). There was also no explanation of each piece nor sauce that we received. The sushi itself was something that you would expect out of a supermarket sushi bar, premade and refrigerated.

Also the restaurant has built drive-through windows on the north side of their building.

Right now the restaurant is open for lunch and dinner, but the owner told me that she has plans to also open for breakfast and include Cuban coffee, Cuban toast, and a variety of breakfast items both for sit-down or carryout.

The menu is a nice mix of small plate flatbreads, finger food appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, pastas, and full dinners. Lots of creative choices on the menu, and a welcome addition to this area of Carrollwood.

On my latest trip I had a cup of their seafood soup which had crabmeat, shrimp, calamari, and cubes of fish mixed with Italian herbs in a light tomato broth. spicy and delicious. I also enjoyed their special of the day which was the sea bass sandwich. The filet of fish was breaded and fried, and then served on an Italian roll with lettuce, tomato and a spicy guacamole sauce. The sandwich was huge, and I took half home to enjoy for dinner.

I'm delighted to support a small, family-owned non-chain restaurant in this area of Carrollwood, and thrilled that these folks are willing to take some chances and offer a nice mix of Italian options.",2013-11-28 04:17:34

It continues to shed and tangle and it's starting to thin. I am very unhappy. Spending close to 400 dollars for a wig I wouldn't expect this. I've reached out to the company and was advised of their 5 day return policy and they are unable to do anything about it. But offers me products on their website to help with shedding and tangling. It took me about a months to receive the wig and I already had a protective hair style before I was able to apply the wig for the first time . Two weeks later I wore the wig for the first time and the first day it  Shedded  and tangled with no added product. The wig was not manipulated the first wear. I manipulated the wig after I noticed it was thicker at the roots and thin(Almost see through at the ends). I simply plucked the part lightly and mold the hair with setting lotion this didn't help at all.

I simply will not purchase products for Diamond hair company again. I wish they inspect  their  product better and ensure their customers are TRUELY getting quality product.

Happy to report that Chase has credited my account and I am told that it will stand. They responded within one day, which is a record for me, to a letter I directed to the Executive Credit Card Service Dept. Now, that is FAST! Not only that, but it was resolved on New Year's Eve Day! I expected to wait weeks for the issue to be resolved. So this most certainly was VERY good news and I intend to remain a loyal customer. For anyone who has a dispute pending -- soldier on. If you are correct and did the right thing, it will probably be resolved to your satisfaction. I am sure that what saved me in this dispute is the fact that I had proof that the merchandise was returned. So save all of your receipts. If you return merchandise using a snail mail system, it pays to pay extra for a guaranteed delivery so that you have a record. I used USPS Priority Mail with delivery insurance. It is usually cheaper than using Fed Ex or UPS. I ordered my postage slip online so that there was a record that I could refer to and print out later. 

However, Metro continues to dispute and refuses to pay back for the charge. I am going to make formal complaints with the FTC, BBB and congressman against Metro for MetroPCS' inexcusable, neglectful behavior. They repeatedly lied and refuse to back up their own sales policies. My advice to anyone considering MetroPCS is DON'T DO IT. If you do, just pray that your service works. Because if it doesn't, you're screwed. Any company that refuses to accept 3 day old defective service merchandise does not deserve to be in business. Period.",2011-01-01 20:48:42

By 8:50pm it was clear the staff was ready to wrap up, soy sauce was  collected from the tables around us and we felt rushed. At 9:15pm a staff member loudly swept around our table where we were mid-meal. Frankly this was gross and disruptive.

It is nicely designed with activities such as a vet's office, grocery store, a nursery room, a paramedic truck and a very fun garden area. The staff is very kind and helpful and constantly reorganizing the toys and games. To call it a museum may be a misnomer as it's more of an activity and learning center in my opinion.

The first thing we noticed is that it's not really close to anything, so unless you live in Fishtown, plan on a minimum $20 Uber to get there and back (ours was $45 from Grad Hospital). The vibe is a little bit confused. At first you're offered a sitting area with a collection of thrift store couches around a wood burning stove. Behind it, the industrial brewing operation. Farther down, a standard beer bar, bread-making kitchen, and... children's playground? I guess this will appeal to hip young parents. I made the mistake of showing up hungry and ordering a burger and wings. Both were very mediocre for the price. A friend ordered the grilled cheese, which had some kind of onion relish that she didn't appreciate. The beer list was lacking in IPAs and stouts. A live band was playing Weezer covers, which was kinda cool, except the concrete floors made for awful acoustics and it was genuinely difficult to have a conversation without yelling. All in all, I'm glad we checked it out, but didn't find a lot of reasons to return to Craft Hall.",2019-03-14 16:27:51

Don't be left stranded like we were.   PLEASE READ. Something is VERY WRONG with the support team behind this card. I obtained this card because I am an avid fan of Marvel and I thought it would be great to have. I applied for and received the card specifically to use on a $2700 car repair. On November 22nd, Wife and I are at the dealership attempting to use the card to pay for the repair. It did not work and was declined. I knew immediately it had to do with the amount being charged. While at the dealership I called the customer service number on the card. After 15 frustrating minutes of trying to work through the automated system, I finally reached Carlos in the Customer Service Department. He stated the card was flagged for possible fraud. At his request, I provided all my phone numbers, mother's maiden name and social security #. He claimed he could not verify my identity. He said he would need to call my phone and leave a message with a code and I was to call back with that code and provide it to the next Customer Service Rep. I asked him point blank, will any customer service rep be able to help me, or do I need to get back in touch directly with you. No, anyone can help you he stated. So we get his message, spend another frustrating 15 minutes working through the automated system and finally get to Jennifer in Customer Service. She tells me that Carlos was wrong. She cannot work with the code he provided so I go through all of the same with her. I give her all of the same info, and she cannot verify identity. I ask her why, she has no idea. This makes no sense at all to us. So we are on hold for 20 MINUTES while she talks with a manager. She comes back and says she needs to call our phone and provide a code and we need to give that code to her. Except we kept her on a Cell this time. We get the code, give it to her, she says we are good to go, we are verified. Dealership runs card, declined. She says she doesn't know what is going on. On hold again for 10 minutes. She comes back and tells me Manager has corrected problem, you are good to use the card. Dealership runs card, declines again. She tells me she has no idea why. We are on hold again. This is not a problem with the Dealership's CC machine as they are running other customer cards without issue. Dealership is closing and  wife is in tears at this point. She comes back to the phone and tells me there is nothing they can do, they have to MAIL ME a code and I will get it in 7-10 business days. At this point, I went off. Why in the hell can you not verify who I am in this situation when I answered all of the verification questions. Why in the hell would mailing me a code work when the two other codes you provided did not work. None of what is happening to us makes any sense at all. I told Jennifer to cancel the card, we are done, it is useless to us if we cannot even use it. We were left stranded. I want everyone out there to be aware of this so this does not happen to you. This has never happened to us before with any credit card I have ever had in the last 30 years.",2016-11-23 21:21:49

My only complaint is the staff. Sometimes they are super super friendly, and others they give you the vibe that they don't want you to be there. There is one staff person in particular who falls into the latter category, but he has been a little better in my most recent trips.

To elaborate a bit on what I mean with my introduction, it started when I ordered the pollo caprese. According to the menu, this dish is grilled chicken breast, imported buffalo mozzarella, imported pomodorina, capellini but I've been on carb restricted diet so I opted out the capellini pasta and subbed the sautéed spinach. So what arrived from the kitchen was a grilled, tough and dry chicken breast, uncooked (basically raw) spinach and a few clumps of mozzarella (which had a unusual taste I find hard to describe, but not as it should). There was no imported pomodorina nor did the dish look at all appetizing!

I thought to myself after the runner left it on the table that I would never order this dish again even before I tasted it, so when our server Lura stopped shortly there after to check on the meal she could see immediately that I was not pleased and glanced at my plate and understood why. She politely asked me if she could make the matter right and took my plate back to the kitchen.

She returned a short while later with my dinner and brought the pomodorina which really helped the dish and a complete new order of the spinach (but again - was not really any better than the first version I was served). 

My recommendation is with all the other menu options to choose from at Macaroni Grill, keep clear of this particular dish, but do ask for Lura because she is a delight and really tried her best to make this so-so meal a more pleasurable experience!",2019-11-26 05:18:58

2nd time out here in Reno, extremely hungry, only thing that sounded appetizing at the time was pasta. Contacted my friend who is a local.

Parking was accessible. Got inside, unfortunately was not greeted promptly. After asking a bartender if it was open sitting or if someone would seat us she helped us right away and sat us. No biggie. Inside was clean. Host sat us down next to the fire place where we would be warm! Very nice. Our waiter, by the name of Robert, introduced himself and instantly offered us a wine. We had the sausage rigatoni and spaghetti with meatballs. I ordered the sausage rigatoni spicy. Robert offered to bring out a few things to spice up our dish- nice touch! While waiting for our food we were brought the free bread with oil. To be honest, wasn't a big fan of the bread but no big deal! We didn't come here for the bread. While waiting for our pasta we had Sauvignon Blanc. As someone who does not drink wine, the Sauvignon black was the niceyest that I've ever had, (again, I don't drink wine).

Now a few days prior I did the delivery route and it was not what my fellow Yelpers been writing about. After tonight I definitely can say I must Retract my last review. 

Everyone deserves a second chance and tonight was that chance. I met one of the owners (Ray) along with an AMAZING STAFF and the genius master creator of their food the Chef. 

For starters, we had the top shelf chips and the Bruddah Rays Ahi Tuna Stack. The chips were yummy but what separated these chips from everyone else was the Balsamic drizzle. I swear if I did not ask the waitress to take the plate away I would've still been indulging my mouth with these chips. Now the Ahi Tuna Stack was a masterpiece of art within itself so dope that you do not want to destroy it. But once you get the courage to do so the taste is an epic experience. The wonton strips along with the ponzu sauce will keep you wanting more.

My children had the kids mac & cheese, kept them happy that we even took home the leftovers. Now my entreé for the evening was the Top shelf Wings. Hands down the best freaking wings I came across since living in Tampa. I thought Union 72 BBQ had good wings. Not no more! 

The thing about being a reviewer is the truthfulness we write on what we ate or tried at an establishment. What made me go and try Top Shelf in person this evening was the fact that the owner reached out to me. This showed me on how much pride they take in the food they prep and deliver to their consumers. Any establishment that wants to show me, a reviewer that I was wrong, is a place that I can respect. 

I left here with a full belly and already planning my next visit along with family and friends. Kudos to Joe and Ray along with the Top Shelf Sports Lounge staff. You won me over with love being put into your dishes.",2018-11-17 02:29:56

The only downside for me was the grits. I ordered my burrito without pork because I'm a vegetarian. I ordered grits as my side and it turned out that bacon was mixed in with the grits. This component of the dish wasn't listed on the sign, and it would have been nice for the cashier to mention it since I specifically requested no pork on my burrito.

I had been asked by a few friends to try Diamond's Hair and let them know my experience.  It was absolutely the worst business transaction I have dealt with in a very long time.  Diamond accepted my payment and then gave me the run around about the status of my shipment for over a week.  I was told it would be shipped out on 3 occasions and it never was.  After I had enough I demanded a refund.  Magically, my hair was available that day and I could pick up (even though I had paid $13 for express shipping).   I needed the hair same day so I obliged.   As  if things couldn't get worse I drove 45 minutes to pick up the hair and they told me they had ""accidentally"" shipped it!!!!        And if that doesn't take the cake they sent me an email the next morning stating that they had shipped my product three days prior, which was an outright lie! 

I understand people make mistakes but the company was unprofessional  and they had to lie to boot.   The establishment looks great but they are VERY tacky when conducting business.  A GOOD company would have at the very least offered an accommodation or partial refund for their royal screw ups.  Then I may have actually come back.  I will be putting in a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, as this is unacceptable and apparently I wont be the first to do so.

First off, the layout is not great -- you can't see most of the play area from the seats and the hidden area is right next to double doors to outside. Also, they just opened and many of the games don't work, are missing their balls, or won't turn on. In addition, the menu is pricy and the drinks and food were underwhelming. For example, we ordered a Bloody Mary, which was $10, and just included Tito's vodka, Bloody Mary mix, and a lemon wedge. It is advertised as coming with Stateside vodka, but whatever.

How could we not have fun, when we had 30 draft beers to choice from and some of the best pizza in the Bi-State area. We were in the bar area which is referred to as Tony's Third Street Cafe. The bar has a more casual and relaxed dining atmosphere and the wait staff makes your experience fun. 

There were three couples and a single in attendance and everyone raved about their food. Alex the single diner, ordered the Cheeseburger pizza and had them hold the mustard.  It was so tasty, it actually tasted like a big meaty burger. I may have to order that one on our next visit to Tony's. I didn't pay close enough attention to what the other couples ordered, but I can tell you what we had; Onion Rings, Large Caesar Salad and Tony's Special Deluxe Pizza. 

The onion rings were big thick slices and evenly breaded. I can see these being a perfect accompaniment to a ""real"" cheeseburger. Our large Caesar was definitely enough for two to share, or it could be a ""meal"" for a person watching the weight. 
I enjoyed the salad, but for my personal taste I like my Caesar dressing to have more of an anchovy bite to it. 

Our pizza was flawless! Tony's offers two types of crust; thin and thick and they should not be confused with the traditional types. Tony's thin crust is more like a flat bread and his thick is the bastard child of traditional and thin crust pizza. What that means is; the crust of the pie part is more like a traditional thin and the edges is like a traditional hand tossed pizza. I wish other pizza parlors offered this type of crust, because it gives you the best of both. 

Another thing that makes Tony's pizza stand out from others, is his sauce. As stated by James M. it has a little ""sweet"" twang to it. When it is combined with all the toppings on my Special Deluxe it made things pop. That sweet sauce covered in meats, onions, green pepper and black olives was a true heavenly delight.  If a picture paints a thousand words, the one I posted of my pizza is worth thousand calories. 

Our server was a blast, she knew it was a holiday celebration (gift exchanging made it obvious) and she made sure we were well taken care of.  I wish Tony's was closer to my home instead of my work so I could become a true regular.",2011-12-25 16:45:32

They do sushi making classes, we definitely have to check it out! We took the train down and walked a few blocks to reach the restaurant. We arrived before our reservation but were seated right away. We had a window view which made it great for people watching, but it definitely would be better in warmer weather because the windows seem like they could turn the restaurant into an open-air concept.
What we ordered: 

Chicken and shrimp dumplings: Long chives, ginger, crispy chicken skin, steamed. Just your average dumpling. Nothing too unique about it, but they were tasty nonetheless.

Wagyu Beef Spring rolls: onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce was a star of this dish.  I could honestly drink it. It went really well with the spring rolls but made the dumplings much better. We honestly wanted to order like 6 more servings of these. SO GOOD.

Eel Avocado Roll A perfect balance of eel to avocado. It had a teriyaki-ish sauce on top.

Spicy Tuna Roll  Just your normal spicy tuna roll, but it's my go-to. I definitely didn't need to eat any more sushi at this point in the meal, but I love trying them wherever I go. 

Dragon Roll: crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with fried eel and avocados. 

Dynamite White Tuna Roll: spicy walu, crunch, and shishitos.

They weren't kidding about the spice of this roll. The spice was at a good level between the spicy sauce and shishitos and the tuna seemed to balance it all out. Would definitely order this again.

 KJ Roll: seared scallops, Kani, cucumber, avocado, and wasabi aioli

Also delicious. Just the right about of heat and had a great amount of seafood in the roll

Rolls that weren't our favorite: 

Broad Street Roll: spicy salmon, avocado, crunch, soy paper, topped with king salmon and spicy salmon. No rice. 

This was the roll that our server recommended. although it was good, it was probably my least favorite roll that we ordered. I'm not sure if I ever had a roll without rice, but it felt like it was missing something texturally. If you like salmon, you should order it, but it was just meh to me.

Overall, we liked the Tuna Bar. The food and service were good, but the atmosphere was a bit loud for our liking. I think I saw that they have happy hour deals, but I know we definitely missed it by going on a Saturday night. I think the prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi joint. The drinks were a bit pricy, so we just had a drink (a Sapporo for him and Prosecco for me).",2019-09-13 22:38:51

The bartender really saved me from rating this restaurant one star down, here's why:

I ordered a Chirashi bowl, and when I asked for wasabi, I was upcharged $5 for wasabi that wasn't even good - the wasabi was tasteless. Consider being upcharged for wasabi with your sushi - that's like getting charged for ketchup with your fries, or getting charged for butter with your toast. Just doesn't make sense. I also had to wait an extra amount of time to get the wasabi and soy sauce. Since I didn't know about this charge while ordering, I passed the $ threshold in my bill where I now have to go submit an expense report. What an annoyance! The rice was on the stiffer side, and the fish was cut into small cubes, which is not ideal. 

The bartender apologized for having to upcharge me, and his kindness made up for it. Otherwise I would've left the restaurant sort of pissed.

A few years back, I was in a Chicago suburb and I found an ice cream shop that used a local dairy to make their ice cream. I was looking for something similar for Mikes Ice Cream. Their website has an apartment rental?? Ok, so Mike is a little quirky. Does he make good ice cream?

Walking up, I see ""Blackberry Cornbread"". Sold! One scoop cone please.
I grab my ice cream and sit up front. Wow! Mike, you did good. The ice cream is creamy, and the blackberry is dreamy. The corn bread is nice but it didn't allow the ice cream to stay together. A big hunk of ice cream fell (I caught it in my hand) at a piece of corn bread.

It is definitely a hidden gem south of State street in the Funk Zone but I love the architecture and love that it is also a wine bar inside! The patio is great on warm days. I ordered a mocha and the cuban sandwich on my last trip here and both were delicious. The mocha was huge, which I love and they both came out quickly. You do have to get your own water/utensils/napkins which can be a little annoying, but they are located right next to the front door. It would be fun to sit inside and watch them bake on one of my future trips and I have yet to try the wine bar. They have a great selection of food, drinks and the pastries look delicious and are huge! That is also on my list for next time.

Her freshly made bread is the best and I've tried several of their subs and they're all amazing. The anti pastas are fresh and the meatballs are gigantic. Her cookies and desserts are to die for which makes sense because they're now being sold at other local restaurants like Havana Harry's!

I'd choose CB over SB any day... 

I ordered an ""Illuminated Mind,"" an organic green tea. The matcha flavors are strong, which I like. The drinks are fairly priced in my opinion.

Tony Luke's was alright but  I think Wawa was a lot better value for the money.  We don't have Wawa in NY so I really wanted to see if the hoagies were as good as I read about.  This particular Wawa in the UPenn area was pretty nondescript.  Inside it looked like a bigger and better version of 7-11.  

I ended up getting an Italian hero because it seemed pretty basic and a good baseline for the Wawa experience.  I got it with a little bit of oil and vinegar.  It was the 10 inch version and the total came out to $7.01.  I was blown away by the price because I don't think you can find a full Italian hero in NY for less than like $10 minimum.  Of course you can't compare Wawa to a genuine Italian hero but still.  

I took the hoagie to a nearby Panera Bread and ate it there.  The hoagie wasn't the biggest sub ever, but it was decently sized.  I believe they put ham and salami in there along with lettuce, onions, and provolone.  

The experience of eating this thing was pretty interesting.  Because there is nothing really special about the hoagie and it's far from the best sandwich ever.  However, it was just so solid for the price.  There was nothing spectacular about the hoagie, but also nothing glaringly offensive about it either.  All in all, it was a really enjoyable eat.  The bread was fairly chewy.  The cold cuts were pretty tasty.  The provolone went well with the cold cuts.  The hoagie was just so easy to continue biting into.  After I finished it I had a bigass smile on my face.  

I was so happy with my Wawa hoagie that I stopped off at another Wawa on my way home and got a 6 inch Meatball hoagie ($4.89 total).  That was also pretty solid too.  I also got a medium coffee ($1.65) and 2 kit kats for $2.  I'm definitely a huge fan of Wawa now.",2019-12-22 06:02:59

The place was pretty crowded in the bar area, not so much on the table/restaurant side. 
Our Waitress Jess was very nice and helpful. It seems as though many people there knew each other which indicates there is a local element to the place which is fine, they obviously have a base clientele. 
We started with a few appetizers, the cheese steak egg rolls were good however one of them was a little overdone. They had good flavor with a little spicy kick. The other appetizer was a fried seafood sampler with Calamari, Shrimp and Clams Casino. This was very good and cooked to perfection with a nice portion. 
We decided to split a meal since we were pretty full from the appetizers. We went with the Chicken Marsala and again the portion size was generous. The Marsala sauce was tasty as were the green beans and mashed potatoes that came with the dish. No big complaints about the food. 
The noise level in the place is pretty high, probably because the place is wide open. This noise was apparent even when the live musician was playing. There was a DJ that started at 9 and he did a great job of mixing up the music genres. The crowd really picked up around 10 and the age group of the crowd was pretty diverse but leaned toward the 20/30's group. 
Overall this seems like a fun place to hang out or have dinner. The noise level is high so if you're looking for quiet/intimate then this isn't you're place. 
I will add that since it is winter we found the restaurant seating area to be pretty cold. There are 2 exit/entry doors on that side of the building and every time the door opened the cold air rushed in and there was no protection from it. The heat didn't appear to on very high so the cold drafts made it tough. We actually moved tables once to avoid the cold from the door opening. 
Overall the experience was great and we would definitely consider going here again.",2019-12-25 15:03:06

I am a sushi snob having lived in NYC and Singapore for years, and this is the only place I've been to in Philly that remotely compares aside from Morimoto and Tomo. Their tuna is very fresh and high quality, the salmon and yellowtail are always very good and fresh too. They do a spicy tuna roll 'the right way' with little mayo and big pieces of sushi, as opposed to the mushy, orange paste-y consistency of most spicy tuna rolls I've had in Philly. The lobster fried rice is also very good with a fresh flavor but a little light on the lobster. I haven't tried anything else as of yet.

What sets this place apart is their happy hour and daily specials - you can't beat it anywhere in The City! Salmon avocado, spicy salmon, or spicy tuna toll for $5!

Everything is weirdly more expensive than it should be?  Examples:

Can of black beans at Target -- 69c
"" "" -- 89c

Pound of green peppers at Fresh Grocer in UCity (which should be outrageous) -- 99c
"" "" -- 1.30$

They survived and the fam was happy for the tasty philly treat.

I think they have platters on their menu that come with fries and a salad...its been awhile since i got that, but I remember the salad being tasty.  You don't exactly go to a pizza place for the salad, so that says a lot.

They are trying to get rid of the American influences so did not have the American whiskies on the menu. The food was doused in butter and you could hardly taste the Japanese flavors in any of the dishes. My lips were puckered because the food is so over salted.

My wife decided to bring me here for Father's Day. It was a good choice, I really enjoyed it. It is been over 10 years since I've been here. Couldn't really remember why we didn't return, 

The service was great, the manager sat us and was very friendly. For Father's Day, it was not that busy. However the server did tell us that it was really busy earlier, before we arrived, and they are shortstaffed. We saw none of this.

What we ordered:

Drinks
Top shelf margarita, on the rocks, no salt.
Peach sangria
Lemonade for kids

Dinner
Father's Day menu
Steak & potatoes, medium rare, 
Garden salad
Shrimp Portofino
Kids meatballs with spaghetti
Kids chicken with broccoli

Dessert
Decadent Chocolate cake

The garden salad is a $2.50 ad on, however if it is unlimited refills. It arrived and was very tasty, made with bib/butter leaf lettuce. It was missing tomatoes. I asked her for another salad as it is unlimited, but I asked her to add tomatoes. She came back and said it was a very busy day and there was no tomatoes. So she took it off the bill. The dinner also came with a small loaf of bread, that was tasty. It was topped with fresh butter and Parmesan. A little on the salty side.

The steak was cooked perfectly. It was also very tender. Probably one of the best steaks I've had in the restaurant the last few years. The potatoes were baby red potatoes, roasted with a Parmesan cheese. It was powdered cheese, kind a like the Parmesan shaker you get a pizza joint. They had a nice caramelization, tender, yet a little crunch. Can't ask for better. The broccoli that came with it, had a nice rich flavor, but was a little too al dente for me. I think that's just a matter of preference though. 

My wife's shrimp was also cooked perfectly, it came with angel hair pasta and mushrooms. The flavor was a little bland. I think it was a garlic butter, but just not enough flavor for me. But she didn't complain lol. She did like the pinenuts in it and the green leaf vegetable in it.

The kids dishes had good flavor. I think the chicken was about 2 ounces, as well as two small meatballs for the kids meals at six dollars. Lots of pasta in it and marinara sauce. I do feel the kids were a little bit short changed. Not very much protein at all, tons of pasta for six dollars. I was able to share my steak with them so they were happy. 

The decadent chocolate cake was perfect. It was included in the Father's Day menu, and very large. We were able to share it and still not finish it.",2019-06-18 00:59:51

Like a lot of places in the Funk Zone, this place is kitschy, filled with hipsters from LA and very expensive.

I have to say right off the bat that the food was good - we defiantly enjoyed it.    The thing is, it was so expensive that I'll never be back.  I love riding in new Mercedes but I would never own one as I simply cant justify the cost when I can have something else for 1/4 the price that is essentially the same and its gets me where im going in similar comfort.

We got the Burrata sandwich which was $15.....um, what?  $15 for bread, cheese, bacon - and it was delicious but $15?  Frankly, I resent the normalizing the $15 sandwich.  $10-$12 is already pushing it for some of our local hero sandwich shops and those are almost certainly good for two meals and I'm 6 foot 3.

We also got soup and a pastry.  Our bill with tip came out to more than $30

We also got there almost exactly when they opened and my wife had to fight to keep our seats as I had to go change our daughter diaper.  People - quite rudely actually - kept trying to physically take our seats as they we not occupied by humans but by our things as we were going to come back.  I get the feeling had we all gone to the bathroom at the same time, our things would have just been tossed onto the floor.

Lets not even discuss the parking situation.

Honestly, the LA hipsters can have this place.  It's good but not good enough to justify the cost or the trouble",2019-12-10 20:40:11

I had a ham & cheese croissant, which was ok, but not that fresh, flakey etc. My daughter ordered the ""seasonal donut"" which was $4.00. It was just an iced cake donut with colored sprinkles. Nothing more than you'd find at a cheap donut place for $1.00 or less. My wife had a blueberry danish. Again, it was OK, but not great. This place says it is a bakery.

Since it's smaller, they do not carry everything other Target stores have.

Our waiters name was Alfredo, I believe it was. His demeanor was pretty strange whenever he would come up to the table he would interrupt the conversation, make a strange joke and then before leaving he would take my nieces empty specialty drink glasses and bring refills without asking so throughout the entire meal we assumed that the refills were free. They both ordered the Alfredo with chicken added and I was told they were pretty underwhelmed by the under salted Alfredo and the dry chicken; for $14-17 per plate Its safe to say I expect a proper Alfredo. I ordered their ""signature"" truffle Mac and cheese and I didn't find it to be good at all; too much truffle oil, not enough salt, pepper or cheese.  When i was given the bill i was unpleasantly surprised to see we were charged for SIX specialty kid drinks for each time our waiter so kindly refilled their glasses without asking or informing that refills were full price or else I would have verbally declined. For 1 appetizer, 3 entrees, 6 specialty kid drinks and a water for myself was just under $95 after tax not including a tip....Woulda spent less if we went to Texas Roadhouse and all got 2lb steaks.

The last two times I've been there the waiters have been absolutely terrible. The first guy was on speed or something and made it obvious that he was annoyed when we asked for bread and other simple requests. During this same trip we waited there for over an hour for two simple salads. 

During our next visit, it was clear that the waiter was hung over. In fact I think he may have been still drunk from the night before. He even knocked over a couple of glasses at different tables. He would constantly repeat his introduction even though he had already been by to take our order. Finally after 30 minutes our salads and soup came. The soup was ok, but the salad was old and the croutons were so disgusting that my girl friend spit them out. They were beyond stale. Our eggplant Parmesan took over 1 hour and 45 minutes to make. We literally were getting up to walk out when it arrived. To make matters worse, the red sauce was so cold that parts of it were still frozen. The eggplant was disgusting as well, we needed a steak knife to cut it. Then the manager came by as she could tell we weren't happy. Her attitude from the very beginning was very defensive. We explained our frustration with the salad, wait time, staff, and entree. She immediately tried to justify the wait time by saying eggplant takes at least an hour to cook. She then claimed that the croutons were made about an hour ago - clearly a bunch of BS. She concluded with ""I'm not supposed to tell you this but our eggplant is very earthy"". Whatever that means. I've had eggplant at other fine restaurants and it never takes longer than 30 minutes to cook nor does it take much effort to cut. Bottom line is the manager needs to go and maybe Mac grill can be saved. Otherwise this business will not survive with her at the helm. She simply isn't manager material, has little to no people skills, and really is a disgrace to the reputation of Mac grill.",2013-01-01 23:33:50

BAP is a no frills traditional Korean food establishment that has been doing takeout this pandemic. The menu is just a few items long and largely consists of different types of bibimbap, all under $10. Ordering was really effortless -- I called ahead with my order for a vegetable and chicken bibimbap and it was ready within 15 minutes. Pickup was also easy and done at a window in the front of the store with a really nice elderly man who I assume is one of the owners. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they gave us free coffee packets which I have since used (I love me some Vietnamese iced coffee). 

The food itself was okay. With the price point, the speed of service, and the no frills menu, I assume the bibimbap is meant to compete with other fast food options, and as a result it should be critiqued as such. Within this category of food, BAP provides a light, healthy, and balanced alternative, which I appreciated. However I think the portion size of the vegetable one was a little small and the flavor slightly bland. You'd do better with spending that extra dollar for additional tofu or meat. Overall, though, it was fine for a $9 bibimbap if you're looking for it. If I lived in the area I could see myself going back if I needed a quick healthy meal and wanted to support a small local business.",2020-10-23 16:48:12

The food and service has been exceptional each time. This last visit we enjoyed live Italian style opera singing. It was very unexpected and fun, definitely not something you typically see at a restaurant chain. 

Every time we've come we couldn't leave less than a 20% tip, these waiters and waitresses are not just nice they are truly genuine. They aren't over the top, with a cheesy ""hello and how may I help you's"" only to scurry from the table as quickly as possible. They genuinely smile and make conversation, have impeccable timing and attentiveness even on a busy Friday night, and know how to make recommendations from the menu. Really wish we could note all their names individually to give them props. 

The food is fully flavorful, not just salty. The bread is warm a loaded with rosemary flavor, I always request balsamic with my dipping Olive oil. Each dish has a unique flavor profile not just your typical Italian style chain where the only options are salty cheesy or salty tomato. People have complained about portion size/cost ratio on other reviews but honestly, I have never left here anything less than STUFFED with left overs for lunch the next day. We typically spend $55-$60 on two specialty drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees (my choice usually being a seafood/lobster dish) at dinner, not shabby at all when you consider the customer service, atmosphere, quality, AND quantity at that price. 

If you suffered a bad experience here, I am strongly advising you give it a second/third shot and even mention your last experience to your waiter when you come in, I'm positive a place like this will make it up to you.

The blackberry part of it was quite tasty, but the cornbread was very dry, and I wished the cornbread bits weren't there at all.
One way you can tell that the flavors are artificial - look at the color of the pistachio ice cream. Mike's was a bright green. Real, unadulterated pistachio ice cream is much more of a dull green, almost brown color. I guess I should have just left when I saw that.
The space itself is also quite depressing. Maybe it's the awkwardly large tables, or lack of decor. But it wasn't a relaxing, or energizing, or fun place to sit while eating ice cream.",2019-02-23 05:14:49

The next day, I tried to return them because it was not as the associate had claimed. The store manager flat out refused the return citing their policy. And didn't even offer store credit.

They had plenty of servers behind the counter and the line moved quickly- almost too quickly to decide on which of the almost 45 flavors to chose from- but that's not a serious complaint. 
The prices for the ice cream is pretty reasonable all things considered.

The ice cream itself was delicious, although nothing incredibly groundbreaking or special. It's really soft and drips all over the place, so be sure to grab a few extra napkins. Long story short, good ice cream, reasonable price, cool atmosphere, definitely worth a try!

Being not a big ice cream eater decided what the heck let's give it a try as everyone said it was the best in Nashville. 

The line was long and the place was not that big but let me tell you no one cared. The other thing was that the temperature was about 40 degrees and people were still lining up and eating ice cream.

They had a huge selection of home made ice creams and like all other ice cream shops they would let you try if you so please. I tried the vanilla chocolate chip as well as the roasted coconut, let me tell you I am from the Caribbean and coconut ice cream is always popular, I never thought that I would have to go to Nashville to have the best coconut ice cream ever.

I had asked for one scoop because I did not want much, their one scoop is very generous I must say. The prices were not bad as well, for one scoop was about $4.00 or less which was worth it.

TCU_SdvCuvBNE8v_LDX1Fw,qhWOIpLeBjcNrkDXhAqbLA,YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,1.0,1,2,0,"Presentation of the Place: The Bathrooms are nice. It reminds you of  an overpriced hotel that you can feel fancy in while taking a dump. The inside of the place reminds me of an amalgamation of the sets of Cheers, Sex in the City, and some French Noir.

The Food: 

Starter:

Jumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs

So, this is the first of many dishes were the common complaint is the lack of salt in the food. From the egg, filling, and crab itself, everything was void of salt or seasoning except for what was a little paprika. The textures are boring and 1 dimensional. For 8 dollars, you are getting 3 deviled eggs at the lowest effort of innovation and care. It is something with less flavor and passion than the ones you are partaking in during Thanksgiving at your grandmas.

Brussels Sprouts with Garlic Aioli and Grated Parmesan.

The Brussels sprouts are cooked exceptional well, which is rare. This is ruined, by the lack of salt and seasoning again. I assume this is due to the amount of Parmesan shaved on top of the dish. This gives the dish an overwhelming umami flavor, and it forces you to reach for the garlic aioli to counter it. After about 10 bites, you begin to realize how white you are because you are essentially eating cheese and mayo. 


Entrees:

Ratatouille with filet

No salt on the filet on top. No salt in the dish itself. What is on the Filet is a lot of balsamic vinegar, which is overpowering. The tomato paste hasn't been stewed long enough, so the dish is really acidic especially with the amount of balsamic vinegar being used.  

Quail and Boudin

This dish is weird. If you ever had a fever dream and was wondering man I wish I could eat that, this is what it taste like. The portion of boudin and quail you get is actual small for the price. Guess what the quail doesn't have on it? The fry on the quail isn't good and the breading breaks offs. The chicken gumbo taste so strange like they almost put soy sauce in it and also has notes of sour. The boudin is really good and is the oasis in this odd dish. 


Drinks:

1 Bottle of the Smith and Hook. Your standard Cabernet nothing flashy.
 
Service: 

I usually don't critique service. I understand that we all take breaks at work, but man no water refills, the restaurant isn't busy, and people from the pass are having to bring our food. This is happening while you and your bartender friend are talking the entire time. Not a good look hombre.  

Verdict: A Salty No

If you want to have a glass of wine with the girls or boys, while you look out at Poydras St. I guess this is the place for you. In my opinion, there are far better options location and culinary wise for you to go to.",2019-06-25 14:50:06

Super nice trendy decor. My date made a reservation and we're were seated at a nice two person booth by the sushi bar. 

Drinks are steep. Like $10-15 a drink. But the drinks were strong and super creative. Since I was on a date I didn't take pics, but they were super pretty. We got the lychee (vodka, lychee, lemongrass, and sake) and the winstons heat (gin, wasabi, lemon and cucumber). Both were super refreshing. 

For the appetizers we got the creamy rock shrimp and the brussel sprouts. The shrimp portion was small but these two were probably my favorite of the night. We ended up getting a regular tuna roll along with king salmon, bluefin, and yellowtail sashimi. 

By the end I was pleasantly full and buzzed haha. A great end. Anyway, for two people, we hit the $130s range. Expect to pay that much for dinner with drinks.",2020-02-13 17:53:50

They were able to seat us right away. We wanted to watch a football game that was not the colts. The manager came over right away and asked which tv would be best for our table. 

We ordered an appetizer, sandwiches, and burgers. The food is reasonably priced and comes in large portions. The bloody Mary's are awesome!!...but the price is a little high at $8.75. 

They have a great patio with a ton of TVs. This will be great place to hang out in the summer. The garage doors open up to the restaurant.

We managed to squeeze in early as it as a weekday after the rain and no one was exactly out. I highly recommend reservations here as they are literally always booked and it was my cousins 3rd try. Their sushi is extremely fresh and they do have very unique takes on rolls compared to what I have seen in the area. Our waitress extremely patient and kind. The decor is beautiful but of course its dim and romantic so you can't really see what you're eating either. Seating is small and parking is of course limited.

Everything about the place is insta-ambiance worthy and picture perfect but I can't help but feel it was a little over-hyped. We got the Tuna Crudo which was delicious (aka tuna carpaccio as a comparison fyi) as an appetizer. As for the rolls, the only memorable one that is all over yelp and pictured everywhere is the broad street roll which is that salmon roll you see with the beautiful filters.

PJQkFOalE8aEexb9xiL3Zg,Xp5Hj2SGl0eDp3Ine9a_vg,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,1.0,15,0,0,"This is a tough review to write, because I have been a devoted take-out customer of Helena Avenue Bakery since they opened. I live nearby, so I go in at least weekly and buy loaves of bread, biscuits and pastries. On Mother's Day, I even asked for their special breakfast of a biscuit with berries and cream, which my husband got to go. In fact, the day before this awful customer service experience, I had purchased over $45 in loaves of bread to take home. 

This past weekend was the first time I ever ordered drinks and sat down at a table to eat in. My husband and I took out-of-town friends for a special breakfast and it turned out to be a fiasco. The bakery was not crowded when we arrived on Friday morning. At the counter, the cashier (a 30-something brunette, who seemed to be the manager), was speaking over the customer in front of her, to a woman walking away, ""Would you like to register a complaint with the owner?"" The woman kept walking away and the cashier/manager turned to the customer in front of her and said: ""Nothing like a customer complaint when you're already having a shitty day."" She went on to complain about everything that went wrong with opening the shop that day before she took her order. My guest and I looked at each other and shrugged it off, since I had had so many positive experiences with take-out orders. 

We went outside and got a table and waited for the other two in our party to arrive. Later, the four of us went up to order. One of our party was a little picky - wanting to know what was in the green harissa, and that was met with some aggressive eye-rolling from the young man helping us. Finally, our order was placed. We sat on the patio and discovered there wasn't a pin to hold up the umbrella and it was starting to heat up. I went back up and waited in line to ask for a pin for the umbrella. The young man rolled his eyes again and said he'd look for it. Our iced teas were up on the bakery counter, so I took those and sat back down. I sent my husband up to get his coffee, which wasn't on the counter, and perhaps the pin for the umbrella, if the young man had located it. Ten minutes later my husband came back with his coffee and all our meals, which were wrapped in to go paper. One was a salad, so that was a mess. 

I went up and waited in line again to get plates, silverware and napkins for us all. There appeared to be plates in the self-serve area under the silverware, but went I bent down to get some, I noticed half the plates had bread crumbs and spilled milk on them. Half seemed clean and half seemed dirty, so I waited in line again to ask for plates. This time, the blonde barista waited on me and I asked for plates. She told me to get them in the area under the silverware, and seemed irritated when I told her half the plates there had milk and crumbs in them. She left and came back with 4 saucers. I asked her if there were no clean dinner plates and she rolled her eyes at me and said she'd see. 

Then, I stood there while she made 2 coffee orders, waiting. After she placed those orders on the counter, she looked at me and said, ""Oh yeah, plates."" She then went over to the kitchen area to a stack of plates. She picked up one and then another. She wiped crumbs off the 2nd and 4th plates with her hands and brought me a stack of 4 and aggressively asked, ""Are THESE big enough for you?"" I ignored the crumbs I had seen her brush off and said, ""Perfect. Thanks!"" 

Over the course of breakfast, which everyone thought tasted delicious, my male guest went back inside three different times and fetched iced tea refills for three of us in our party. When we left, we cleaned up after ourselves and put our dirty plates in the tubs provided. I stopped by the barista and asked her for some more iced tea and she sneered at me: ""Sorry. We don't provide free tea refills."" I said to my friend: ""I didn't realize you were paying for all those refills everytime you went back inside and got them. Thank you so much."" My friend said: ""I didn't. They were free."" He nodded to the same blonde female barista who had sneered No Free Refills at me and said: ""She gave them to me free."" 

So, if you are a handsome man, you'll get clean plates and free iced tea refills, but if you're a middle-aged, heavy-set female who drops about $50 a week in the establishment, be prepared to get dirty plates, a big sexist and ageist attitude and treated like shit. I've dropped my last dollar in this establishment and will be taking my business to the excellent D'Angelos Bakery, where their baked goods are cheaper and just as good, their breakfast menu has more than a couple of choices, their parking isn't a battle with day drinkers in the funk zone, and their staff doesn't treat customers with disdain, like weekend tourists they'll never see again.

I was able to get the key cut for cheap and was offered programming of the key to the car for a really good price that I couldn't pass up.

I have also had their meatball sub which comes with four HUGE meatballs.

They also have a case full of yummy-looking desserts although I have not yet tried any. And they sell a variety of Italian grocery items such as tomato sauces, pastas, etc. They make their own Italian sausage, too, which is out of this world.

The place is small and they have only a few tables for those that want to eat-in. But even at noontime, I have never had a problem finding a place to sit.

Went with a friend on a Wednesday evening around 6:30. We were seated by a hostess with a pair of white sunglasses on the top of her head. Not what I expected for a first impression of what I thought was a nicer restaurant.  There were two other parties in the first room where we were seated by the window. Shortly after being seated a girl came by with water and bread. Then a different girl came by to see if we wanted anything to drink besides water. After my friend got his tea and we ordered an appetizer from girl #2, the hostess came by to see if we wanted wine or a drink from the bar. Throughout the whole experience I honestly couldn't tell you who our server was because between the three of them they all brought us food, filled our drinks, checked on us, brought us a dessert menu, brought us the bill, etc.

Now on to the food, which seemed to take longer than it should for a restaurant with three tables. I must say that we got to ""enjoy"" each course before the next one arrived instead of getting less than half way through your salad before your entree arrives.

Ordered the Calamari for an appetizer, the sauce was good but the calamari was way over cooked and were leaning towards the burnt side.

We ordered a large House Salad with chicken & large Pasta Primevera to share. The waitress offered to split the dishes on two desperate plates so we didn't have to do it on our own. Since she was doing that I asked if my friends plate could have the cheese & onions held on both his salad & pasta. She said it wouldn't be a problem.

The salad plates came out after we gnawed through the calamari. They came separate with mine only having the cheese and onions. The salads looked pitiful and both plates were missing croutons (which we couldn't figure out what was missing while we were sitting there). At one point my friend picked up a piece of lettuce and dressing was literally dripping off the piece of lettuce. Needless to say it was way over dressed.

Now on to the pasta, which we also asked for no onions or cheese on one of the dishes. Well the salads were too good to be true, because both of the pasta dishes came out with onions and cheese. My friend didn't want to be a pain so he ate it anyways and I'm sure paid for it later. The pasta had plenty of veggies in it but it was swimming in olive oil instead of being sautéed. Neither of us finished and turned down her offer when the hostess came by to see if we wanted boxes.

Girl #1 (the hostess) came by to see if we needed anything else and then brought us a menu so we could look at dessert. Unfortunately they didn't have Sorbet for my friend so we didn't end up getting any dessert even though I'm sure I could have polished off a plate of tiramisu on my own.

Again I was under impressed and disappointed with my first visit to a neighborhood restaurant. I'll go back and give them another try, but it'll have to be on somebody else's dime.",2013-07-30 04:32:55

We split the goat cheese and fig flat bread and the charcuterie board. The charcuterie board was worth the money. They offered plenty of  accoutrements with the selection. High quality meat and cheese noted and were not skimpy on portions. Probably could skip the flat bread next time. Split the impossible burger which is the best one I have tried thus far in the city.

So much so that we got lost, stopped at a gas station about a half mile up the street for directions and none of the three locals trying to help knew anything about it.  It's a shame, because this is a cool little place for kids.  

It's in an old schoolhouse, built in 1895, just off rte 159 south of downtown.  They've done a nice job of  providing the goods to entertain kids for a couple of hours.   It's more of a hands-on museum than a place to come and be entertained, so come prepared to use your imagination.   I describe it as a place to come and play with your kids more than a place to let your kids run around entertaining themselves.   The highlights for us were the little newsroom complete with camera and TV and the earthquake table, where you build a structure, then select the level of earthquake you want to simulate using a nearby computer monitor.  The walls are decorated with some pretty good artwork, especially the library area. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The price is currently $4 each, pretty fair, I'd say.   The ideal age for this museum is probably 3 to 9 or 10.   I noticed they have a wine and whiskey tasting coming up.  I guess this is a fundraiser.

That's the thing about buck a shuck, expect to wait 20 to 30 for those oysters to come out, especially if you order a bunch all at once like I do.

Calamari was good but there were banana peppers breaded and fried in there with the squid so I kept getting a mouthful of Dear God No.

The courtyard is VERY nice now that we're starting to get some cooler days.  The food was also mostly very good.  The deviled eggs appetizer, while good, wasn't really a standout over other deviled eggs I've had at restaurants.  The main dishes, however, were much better.  My salmon dish was pretty good.  The salmon was nicely cooked and seasoned.  The spinach was very well seasoned as well.  In fact, for some it might be TOO well seasoned.  For me it was enjoyable because I like a bit of spice, but you guys may want to mention on the menu that the spinach features a pretty heavy sprinkle of red pepper flake.  In fact, I'd probably refer to it as a ""spicy"" spinach because I could definitely see some people being taken by surprise.  The crabcake dish was also very good.  Crabcake was very heavy in crabmeat and light on filler.  Potatoes were done nicely, and sauces on both dishes were handled just right.  As far as main dishes go, the main negatives were the Dutch Baby being I think a bit underdone and the poached eggs having slightly overdone yolks but slightly underdone whites.  No idea how they pulled that one off...    But the main reason for subtraction of a star is the service.  First off, lil black dude who was the host, seemed to have ZERO care about doing his job.  We walked in to no smile or greeting or anything.  He just looked at us.  Fiancee says Hi table for two please.  He says ""this way"" and unceremoniously brings us to a table right next to the other two parties in the entire place.  So the courtyard has (I counted) 11 tables.  There are 3 parties in total dining at the time.  And he thinks it a good idea to sit us all on top of one another.  That's just a lack of care or common sense or both.  Spread us out a bit!!  He did seem to care GREATLY, however, when an attractive single diner came in.  Even came back to check on her at some point to see that she was ""doing OK"" *eyeroll*.  Our waitress, on the other hand, was very nice, but maybe seemed to not have a great grip on the POS system as literally EVERY DISH was brought to the wrong table.  Not just ours, but everyone else's.  By the time we had all of our food, there were only 4 tables occupied.  How hard can it be?  Also, she completely forgot my second drink.  BUT she caught her mistake and brought it on the house.  So that is a great positive.  She realized she made a mistake and went above and beyond to make it right without me even bringing it up.  But at the end of the day, the food was very good so I'll very probably be back.  Just, in all honesty, replace the host.  I'm never one to try to rid people of their employment, but if he's only going to show hospitality to patrons he thinks he can flirt with, then he is quite simply in the wrong business.  That, and retrain your wait staff on the table numbers.  I think if y'all can do that, combined with the quality product that the kitchen is putting out, y'all will be very successful.",2018-10-29 22:04:47

For starters , they're listed under ACE at MSY, however, they're Nifty Car Rental and they are not directly at the airport like the other car rental companies.

So I land at MSY get to the car rental
Location and I don't see them inside. Asked around and was told to call some number and they will come pick me up and take me over . That was red flag number one. The owner Steve comes and get me (very fast ] in some dirty dusty old van that smell horrible and he's Wearing no mask despite all that's going on.

We get there and this place is FILTHY. Old trailer looking home that looks as if it's going to crumble any second. Red flag number 2 is that all the contracts are handwritten out on paperback like is it not 2021 WTF ! They call your insurance because they do not offer insurance which is also a red flag and get your policy number . In all my renting years never had someone call for my policy number. If u read other reviews u will see people say they file claims on their old dusty cars .

Here's the real information : first car I get is so was a white Kia Forte that smelled like so much weed mildew and had burn marks in the seats. I go inside to tell the girl and she's like ""oh that's New Orleans people for u "" like excuse me ? Clean your cars and get rid of them . Next car is a red Corolla with a broken bumper and it also smelled like smoke . I sat and called around and couldn't get a car soon so I had to take this one because I quickly needed to get to Mississippi in a press time. Why I turn the car on it have 136K+ miles .... These people are unreal . Plus the tire pressure light was on which she said was the sensor malfunction. How dare you rent these old cars to someone like that. I drove to Mississippi in silence cause I was so scared I would break down and plus the touch screen in the car don't work so you can't pair your phone . When I got to Mississippi I rented from someone on Turo and let that car sit the weekend.

When I returned I made sure I let them know I was recording because u can't record without someone knowledge in the event you need to use it against them. I got the lady to talk around the car with me and verbally acknowledge that there were no new damages and everything was good.

I was so fed up I called a Lyft to take me to the airport cause I didn't want Sh*T to do with them. Stay say please !!!!!",2021-08-24 17:11:06

From the art installments, to the Halloween Parties and Ghost Tours to the building being empty for years.  When I was at the City Market downtown one weekend, I saw that they were restoring the building and it looked like maybe some new tenants.  I hoped that they were businesses and that they were not turning it into condos.

My prayers were answered and Roast Coffeehouse and Mercer Tavern were soon to be opened.

You would think that with my food obsession I would be one of the first people in on opening day...  Due to the busy summer I did not get to visit Roast until almost the end of August.  I had saw a tweet about a Maple Bacon Latte and knew I would have to drop in to see what they were all about.

The Bacon-Maple Latte is a maple flavoured latte. It is garnished with whipped cream and then a couple of pieces of caramelized Bacon.

The Bacon is fantastic! Crispy and gooey at the same time - it stuck to my teeth. Bacon lovers would love this taste experience.

If you want the latte to have any Bacon flavour in it you need to dunk one of your pieces of Bacon into the latte and let it float - that is, if you can resist eating it!

The Baristas at Roast took a while to get the latte out but it looked like they were having problems with one of the spouts on the espresso machine pulling shots. It was worth the wait - the shots were perfect.

The atmosphere and decor in Roast make for a very comfortable experience. The hardwood floors and open beamed ceiling are the originals from the warehouse. It has a rustic feel while the fireplaces give the atmosphere warmth and the stainless steel bar type chairs give it a touch of modern class. There are overstuffed leather chairs by the fireplaces so there are ""homey"" feels to certain areas as well. Sure to please many different types of customer.

If you like to avoid the hustle and bustle that the ""Green Giant"" offers - then you should give Roast a try. I can see myself curling up in front of a fireplace with a good book and a great cup of coffee for an hour or two.

Kudos Roast!",2012-12-17 21:26:56

I walked in around 7:30pm on a Friday to pick up a birthday cake pre-ordered. I was waiting for a friend so I decided to buy an egg tart (somehow they charged me 90c even though the sign CLEARLY said 80c, but I wasn't in the mood to argue over 10c) and use the rest room while I waited. The door to the bathroom was locked and all I got as an explanation was, ""the last person to use it must have locked it behind them. We have no key."" HOW do you not have the key to your own bathroom? I was confused at first and thought it must be a simple misunderstanding but nope, they really just didn't want me to use their restroom. I asked them where they used the restroom if its locked and they just mumbled and didn't answer me (mind you, there was no language barrier--they completely understood me). So I sat down with the egg tart (which honestly wasn't even as good as those at other bakeries) and waited for my friend.

When I checked on the cake, the name was spelled wrong even though we had confirmed the spelling multiple times. So when I asked the woman to change it, she just had the biggest attitude. I could hear both women behind the counter talking about me, I guess they didn't realize that I could understand. Believe me, I am the first to admit if I am in the wrong or if I had any part in bad service received but this is the first time I have genuinely been shocked at how I was treated. I will never be back here again. Get your pastries somewhere else, where the employees are friendlier, where they won't unreasonably overcharge, and the food tastier.",2016-05-14 18:26:10

This pathmark also has a seafood counter that doesn't smell of almost bad fish, and while the selection isn't the best in the city, it is the most reasonably priced.

They apparently require that, FIVE YEARS LATER, I submit my receipt or contract and until I do that, my review has been taken down. This is crazy. Why would I save a receipt from 5 years ago? Changing my 2 star rating to a 1 star because a) that's shady as heck and b) I still have all 250 wedding guests faces embedded in my brain as they saw my look of confusion and then sadness when a vanilla boring frank sinatra song was played during my cake cutting and not the one that meant so much to us that I emailed and verified they would play. If you music means anything to you don't use this company for your wedding. If you are a z1077 listener and have zero expectations from your dj, go for it. 
Which leads me to this: if you are planning a wedding, don't trust wedding wire to give you the real skinny on companies services. 

.........
A month before our 2011 wedding, our DJ cancelled on us. As you can imagine, we were freaking the f out. TKO squeezed us in, which we were very grateful for. 

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with their services. My husband and I are music enthusiasts, for sure. And we aren't exactly playing the top 50 on any charts, we like a little more obscure music. So, we sat down for over an hr with them, picking out songs we specifically HAD to have played at the wedding. They didn't have any of these songs on the date of the wedding. Honestly, ""we had a near perfect wedding day"" - I always say ""....except for the DJ."" I am FULLY aware that everything can't go perfectly, but if I owned a service-oriented company, I sure as heck wouldn't want to be any brides exception to her day being perfect!!! 

Our cake cutting song was so important to both of us. We had been trying to decide which of two very special songs to dance to, and ended up wanting the one we didn't choose for our first dance, for the cake song. Instead, they played some generic song - he said he didn't have the other one. WTF? Are you serious? In this day and age, with technology what it is, a DJ should have a hot spot on his cell phone and be able to download ANY important song at the drop of a hat. That is a pretty big flub. The technology is there, you need to be using it. Missing something as important as that on a bride's wedding day is really awful customer service. 

Our DJ was a very nice guy and he brought the party, for sure. However, I am still a bit heart broken about the songs that didn't get played.  Careless and inconsiderate. Wouldn't retain their services again.",2013-04-02 20:39:00

Fed up with that restaurant, we contacted The Macaroni Grill.  On very short notice they agreed to immediately seat our group of more than a dozen persons.  In addition, we were seated in a private room for our birthday celebration.  The servers were very pleasant, our meals were served promptly, and the food was outstanding.  The birthday celebrant was even treated to the happy birthday song in Italian and a free dessert. The kind of treatment provided by The Macaroni Grill is how a restaurant gains and retains customers.  The Cheesecake Factory lost many customers this afternoon and forever.

The $10 'green egg' (green harissa) biscuit overall was pretty good but the egg inside was not (allowed to spread too thin when being fried and thus much of it was cooked to a dry, paper thin crisp disc).

Granted, early summer is the best time to enjoy ice cream but is there ever, really, a bad time to eat a sweet treat. Plus, given Mike's location, it's possible that locals may not be giving it its due (thus, making the tourists do all this work). Ignoring Mike's would be a mistake. If you're a fan of ice cream, you need to spend some time Downtown getting a bit fatter. It's worth it.

Despite seeing the lights and neon, I'd motored past Mike's in an effort to avoid all the yee-hawin', boot wearin' folks who plug up lower Broad. One night, however, I'd spent a good time drinking, socializing and picture taking but doing little in the way of eating. Debating the merits of going home and going to bed, going home and making a late dinner or wandering around Downtown in search of food, I chose the latter... and then I chose Mike's. Why eat dinner when you can eat dessert? I've got to make this 'adult' thing work for me one way or another.

So, I stumbled in and was pleased to see I was the only customer on this particular Tuesday evening. Nice. I perused the flavor options and then went to my go-to. It's important to have go-to dishes so as to measure the quality of what you're eating. When it comes to ice cream, my go-to is the sundae. This is also because I'm a fatty. So, I took on the warm brownie sundae and gave it a good what for. Picture it (and prepare for fragment sentences): large bowl. A moist, dense, cake-y brownie, steaming warm. Whipped cream. Nuts. Cherry. FOUR scoops of ice cream including: chocolate overload, pralines & cream (my favorite), nutter butter (a very close second), and maple walnut (I threw you off with that one, didn't I?). I held my sundae as a prize to the world. Even the worker who made it was impressed with herself. I took my bounty to the front window to eat. As I dug in, I noticed people passing by, looking at it... and stopping in. No lie: within 10 minutes of me being in the front window and luxuriating with my ice cream, the shop was packed. Sundaes were the order of the evening. The mood was jovial (one gentleman telling me he stopped in because of what I was eating and rewarded me with a dirty joke), the dining room was loud and everybody was ice cream eating (cue piccolo; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhUkGIsKvn0).

His meal came with miso soup, side of the day, rice, and pickled veggies. The veggies in my dish were super fresh and bright. The chopped asparagus was a nice touch.

The decor is fantastic and romantic. They used a lot of deep jewel tones in the fabrics. The booths were microfiber in a deep burnt orange color and others were a deep blue. The chairs were a little mod and the bar open. The booths were tucked away where you could get some privacy. The tables evoked more of a traditional dining experience.

I keep trying to catch them straight out of the oven, but I think you probably have to ask them for that or something, because the last time I watched them bring out a fresh batch of egg tarts, and ordered it, it was still cold. Definitely still, good, I just want to try them right when they come out of the oven. I wish I knew when they baked those darn egg tarts. I'll have to ask them next time. Anyways, unlike most of the places in Chinatown, they use a flaky crust for their egg tarts. Pair that with the sweet, creamy baked egg custard filling, and it is a match made in heaven haha. Flaky crusts are the way to go for egg tarts. 

Their other buns and savory pastries are standard; taste the same to me anywhere I get them. My sister favors their butter bread though, which is very good, and can act as dinner rolls. The drinks here are ok, nothing special. They serve the standard milk tea, lemon tea, and they also have bubble tea, but I've never gotten that here. They have a few small tables for you to sit on, and a refrigerator with soda and canned/boxed drinks right by the door so you can grab and go(no five finger discount!!! Remember to pay). I've also had the lemon cake before, which wasn't bad, but sometimes I do stray from the cakes, as they don't always look fresh.

I don't think I've ever seen young people working here; it's usually 1 or 2 middle aged ladies behind the counter. They're not mean, but they're not overly friendly either. They just do their job, that's all it is. No extra smiles or small chat. And usually, there will be one or two middle aged/old men sitting toward the back reading the newspaper, making it seem more like the cafes in HK, where old people will hang out in cafes just to drink a cup of tea and pass the hours by.

Now, a party who had actually made a reservation and requested an outdoor table, would be bumped inside because the manager refused to stand up to this patron -- not a great way to run a business. Now for the food -- Copper Vine has their menu coded with ""gluten free."" Nowhere does it say that the items are only GF when specified or modified -- it just labels them GF. I ordered the pork belly, which purports to just be gluten free, but mentioned that I have celiac, and our waitress responded ""oh, let me actually go ask the kitchen. I don't think the menu key is right."" She went and checked, and much to my shock, was right. At this point, I was rattled and wanted to talk to someone who truly knew what was gluten free. Our waitress sent over the manager, Lydia again, who had literally no information. She started off with ""well I try to eat gluten free too,"" which is never something that someone with celiac wants to hear. I could tell she was making it up as she went, as she couldn't answer any follow up questions. If I'd been with my boyfriend, we would have just left. Since I was in NOLA visiting friends, I stuck it out, opting for a seafood dish that I was confident was naturally GF. The food was good, but management makes or breaks a restaurant, and Copper Vine needs to spend some serious time retraining their staff.",2019-04-01 19:49:07

Shout outs to Caspian, Victoria, Sierra, Nicole, Alana, Dafne & Noah and the team there that are always friendly and kind.

Can I just say that the house style wings was one of the BEST tasting wings I ever had and In my opinion it is the BEST in WESLEY CHAPEL. 

They are grilled not fried so it's not greasy at all. They were marinated overnight so they are very flavorful. Delicious!!! When you can eat the wings without needing any ranch or blue cheese, I call that a WINNER! 

SN: it is more expensive that other wing related restaurants in the area if you compare prices but it's sooooo good!

The saki was good, but not quite my thing, so I ended up with the 'bad sleep well' as my cocktail of choice for the night.  It was so refreshing and delicious.

It was a rainy weekend so unfortunately the patio was closed for seating, but I can imagine dining in their outside space would be so nice! 

We split a bottle of Malbec wine (750ML, $36) and 3 appetizers: black truffle fries ($9), brussels sprouts ($8) and the bianca flatbread with added charcuterie on top ($14). We were a bit worried the portions would be too small to share but it filled us up perfectly! Everything was tasty. The parmesan aioli that came with the fries was particularly good, and I actually preferred it over the aioli that came with the brussels sprouts. We added charcuterie to our bianca flatbread for an extra $3 and while the amount of meat was on the measly side, it was very tasty and paired well with the three cheese flatbread -- in layman's terms, it tasted like mildly sweet little cubes of ham LOL. The water also tasted like it's cucumber-infused. 

In light of the new COVID mask guidelines, some staff members were and some were not masked. Service was extremely attentive. We were asked a few times how everything was and were also offered a dessert menu towards the end of our meal. They were able to split our bill between two different cards. We stayed a while (probably longer than welcome) to just chat and finish our wine, and I didn't feel too pressured by staff to hurry up and pay and leave. As for the ambience, while definitely nice, people eating there ranged from couples dressed up for date night to just casual groups of friends i.e. dress up if you want to but also don't feel pressured to!

The Good:
The space is lovely. It has great ambience and is roomy and stylish with plenty of comfortable seating. It's always cozy and warm, unlike many other cafes. There are nice little touches around, such as a self-serve dispenser with lemon water. This place doubles as a wine bar in the evenings and there's a  decent selection of wine and beer. The baked goods are also quite good. 

The Bad:
The service here is hit or miss. On some days, I have been greeted by a friendly face and on other days, I have had to deal with an unhelpful and lackadaisical hipster, whose description of the maple bacon latte was simply that it is ""sweet"". 

While they do have a small food menu, I have not had the chance to try anything as the one time I wanted to order something, I was informed that they were sold out of everything. This was at 4.p.m., which is the advertised time that they start serving food. 

The coffee here is ok. While they do have a selection of interesting and creative drinks (Maple Bacon latte, salted caramel latte etc.), the actual quality and taste of the espresso is on par with, or marginally above,  most chain coffee shops. For the prices listed, you would expect better quality. This is not to say that the drinks are bad -- only that they could, and should, be better.

Started off with the wedge and this I can not recommend highly enough. Who would have ever thought a ""wedge"" could be done uniquely on a stick? Crunchy onions on top and that dressing.... I have decided to try to imitate that one at home - it won't be the same, but just the presentation - yum. The cauliflower was highly recommended and we all decided it was the least impressive of the evening. The ikineri steak was amazing - large portion and quite tender.

The owners of the truck were really polite so it helped. 

When I got back to my car to eat it, I was thoroughly impressed. I love myself a meatball sandwich but this was above average in my book.

David and I were here for his cousin's birthday celebration and we were seated upstairs. We didn't have a full dinner, but we did have some really good fries and we had a few cocktails. First, since it's a wine bar, I started with a really good malbec that was reasonably priced. I like that they give you the option of a half pour or whole pour, I guess in case you want to just do some tastings. Even though they mainly specialize in wine, they do have a full bar and a pretty decent beer selection. I had the Holy Roller IPA which was a fairly priced $7, especially considering the atmosphere of the place. 

We hung out at a while and they didn't rush us at all as we basically just sipped drinks and enjoyed conversation.

For breakfast, I ordered the Lox bagel (keep in mind that it's not on the menu when you get there, but you can definitely order it). It was delicious and the tomato was super fresh, no one likes a mushy tomato. 

This is all around a great place to grab coffee, a quick bite or just stop and enjoy a break. It's a little hidden so once you see the sign for Lark it's right next to it.

This may be a bold statement, but Tuna Bar is the best sushi I've ever had (and I've tried a LOT of sushi). 

Even the atmosphere is so interesting. The lights and decor are clean and aesthetically pleasing. The hostess seated us immediately at our reservation time and handed us menus, as well as a drink menu. 

To start, we ordered Sapporo beers, a Geisha (green tea, soju, sparkling white wine, green tea flakes), and a See You Later cocktail (which had rose petals on top). I had the Geisha, and it was a great pairing with the sushi- very light but flavorful. 

For our appetizers, we split a tuna curdo (my favorite dish), tuna tartare, edamame, and a seared tuna salad. Everything was amazing and flavorful. The tuna was the best fish I've ever tasted. 

The owner of the restaurant brought us complimentary shishito peppers, as well. They're simple but delicious! I'm actually craving them now. 

For the rolls and sashimi, we ordered a variety- old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna roll, maguro sashimi, and a peanut avocado roll. I attached pictures of the menu that explains what's inside each. 

The maguro sashimi was my favorite. It's just a piece of fish, but it was so tender and flavorful. Even the wasabi that I put on the fish was unique! Much different than the generic, gooey wasabi from every other sushi restaurant I've tried.

The staff is professional and courteous, you are sent reminder emails about your appointment which is nice for people who forget or are just busy with life.  So for my personal experience here it is: 
1. I have had a cleaning done by Ashley who gave me a great, pain-free cleaning while also giving me more information on dental hygiene than I could have ever imagined, which I appreciated.
2.I have had several fillings in the past 2 weeks and not one time did I experience pain during or after.  Dr. Pamela Adams kept me at ease during both procedures and made sure I was calm and comfortable. 
3. Finally and most importantly I became a patient because of debilitating jaw pain I was having.  At one point I wasn't even able to touch my teeth, this caused horrible headaches and was making my everyday life a living hell. After a consult, Dr. Adams diagnosed me with TMJ and told me my problem was that I grind my teeth while I sleep she recommended a bite plate for the jaw problems.  She took a mold of my teeth and within a week my bite plate was ready.  I went in for it to be fitted and now I sleep with it every day.

Terrible, terrible, terrible. The worst card I have ever had - their practices are not only rude but should be illegal. I have had a Chase Freedom card for a few years now. Last year, they had canceled a Walmart charge without notifying me. A week later, having not received my merchandise, Walmart informed me that the credit card had canceled it. I was lazy and let it go. Now we ordered a ticket for my son to study abroad overseas -- $600. We were so happy we got a good deal. Chase canceled that. We had to settle for $850 a few days later. Customer service told me that it was their right to do so and that I had no recourse. They said that they could do that at any time. I have always had Mastercard and Amex, and they notify me if there is a potential fraud. Not Chase. They just cancel it. The reason for having a credit card is convenience, and I have spent over 3 hours on the phone with different reps and managers, all not only unhelpful, but rude. And at times I have had to wait over 20 minutes to get a rep.",2015-06-13 20:44:36

The food was good but what stood out for us was the service. Copper Vine has multiple wine menus...I wanted to try something new but didn't know where to start. Grace made a few knowledgable suggestions and even brought over the sommelier. Since we were having a casual night I was unsure about bringing over the sommelier...typically I would shy away from something like that. WOW, I was so pleasantly surprised! She was so bubbly and friendly. She didn't sacrifice any professionalism in her demeanor but talked about wine in a way that wasn't elitist...I felt like she didn't care if we thought she knew a lot, she wanted us to know about wine and the brand. This girl is something special. By the end of our talking I had a flight of 3 amazing wines...a Napa Valley sauvignon blanc, a chardonnay from Santa Barbra, and an Albarino....and I could tell you about all 3, Thanks Copper Vine!  The night we visited was busy and we definitely weren't the table spending the most money....the sommelier still came back to check in and continue conversation.

Worst of all, the play area (basically the whole point of coming, for us) was poorly thought out. It's a big wooden structure that you can't see many parts of from where you're sitting and eating. So it's not like you can sit and relax while eating and drinking and still keeping an eye on your kids. You have to keep getting up and looking for them.

Who is very knowledgeable about her selection and it's not small by any means, the Japanese whisky list is also very impressive I got to try a few whisky's I haven't tried yet.

We started with a few cold items the wedges which were awesome very light crisp and full of flavor, first off everything is full of flavor. The tsukemono was perfectly seasoned and fresh, the chirashi was also very fresh and had walu, oprah, and ora king salmon. I definitely reccomend starting with the cold before the hot because the dishes come out as ready. After chatting with the sake somm. And ordering a bottle of the otokoyama we ordered from the hot list. Jesse our waiter was very helpful with our questions and very attentive to our table. We ordered the (pics available) Dan Dan shishitos, the brocolini with rock shrimp (order this please) the kinoko which is a mushroom miso flavor bomb, the ika karaage which is basically tempura squid, the spicy crab noodle is a must every noodle is covered in great sauce the noodles al dente (another please order)the shuman came next and they didn't disappoint either but now I'm starting to think I ordered too much oops... on to the Jidori chicken a never ever chicken and I don't mean not to order it, it was fried to perfection came with a kewpie mayo and a sweet and spicy sauce. I just meant it's a strain of chicken that's DNA has never been tampered with by humans and is raised in completely open pens not the kind PETA shows in those tapes and fed an organic Vegan diet. On to the beef I'm dying a happy death at this point... the first two to show up was the mishima ranch American wagyu and the A5 miyazaki prefecture wagyu both very tender and cooked to perfection the American wagyu has more bite to it but the A5 is like seared foie gras melt in your mouth yummy goodness. Last but not least the American skirt steak showed up ... truly a sizzling flavor bomb the corn the onions the miso butter and the j sauce make sure to get everything in one bite for the perfect bite. I've been writing so much I forgot to talk about the trout just check the pictures ... kudos to chef Kynsey and her amazing staff the GM Michael seale for coming to the table and chatting with us Kristin breringson for the awesome recommendations and most of all Jesse for taking care of us and making sure put needs were met.

I have been going to Tony's since I was a baby, literally. This used to be the nicest restaurant in Alton, IL, but that is not the case anymore.

I have had two awful experiences there within the last few months, and I don't see how I can support this establishment anymore. The first bad experience was a mess from the beginning and ended with me waiting over 30 minutes to get my bill because ""the computer was down."" To compensate me for my $40 bill the manager sent me a $10 gift card (thanks you cheap skate), which I gave to my parents because I was so disgusted by the service that I had no desire to go back.

Just a couple days ago my best friend was begging me to go out to eat with her and I agreed, and she chose Tony's. Great. I started off by ordering a Mojito, which is considered one of the most popular cocktails in America. According to this website it's #1...

http://www.themost10.com/10-most-popular-cocktail-drinks/

Anyways I digress. They couldn't make me a mojito for some reason so I ordered a Moscow Mule.  The waiter first asks me what is in a Moscow Mule (ginger beer + Vodka). So I made sure they had a ginger beer and explained how easy it was to make. Apparently the Moscow Mule is too difficult for the precious bartender to make. Although they had ginger beer and they clearly have vodka they refused to make me one stating that ""they didn't know how to ring it in.""

To be fair, Chase is good for when your card is being hacked or stolen and they usually immediately notify you and cancel the card, and even send you or overnight you a new card most of the time.  However, one time while traveling out of the country, our card was stolen by a pickpocket.  I reported the theft, got a verification number and when I got back to the States I found that Chase had done NOTHING.  That same card continued to be used for three weeks after I reported the theft.  After I raised heck they reimbursed me for my trouble, but it was scary.
Please pay attention to the below:
When it comes to MERCHANTS RIPPING YOU OFF, NOT PERFORMING A SERVICE PROPERLY, WHATEVER ... Chase is shamefully negligent and unhelpful.  No matter how blatant the ripoff is, or how bad or fraudulent the service by the merchant, Chase only stops payment for a month or so while they go through a fake show of support which always results in you not winning and losing your money to an outright crook.

We thought by booking almost a year in advance, and a venue such as The Fox Theatre we would have had a more experienced DJ for the wedding.  They announced things as requested, but I don't know why we filled out the questionnaire. It was a small detail, but they referred to Natalie's dad the entire night as MR. Morris, rather than DR. Morris.  Clearly they did not reference the form.  Also, it was our understanding that the DJ would be wearing a suit or a tux.  The young man with her had no jacket or tie.

Concerning the soundcheck for our friend who was playing the guitar and singing for the father-daughter dance:
They called her the day before and said to be there 4-4:30, so she arrived at 3:30 just in case they were ready early.  She walked back with my husband, (Natalie's father), but she was just getting set up for the actual ceremony.  She said they'd do it during the cocktail hour.  Our friend stayed close by the entire time, to remain available. When the time came there had been no check and the DJ was attempting to set a mic up for vocals, and no mic for guitar (although that is what they said they would be doing when they called).  At that point our friend declined the mic because the balance of vocal and guitar would have not been good.  She ended up singing and playing with no mic whatsoever. 

We requested the DJ to interact on a moderate level.  The level of enthusiasm by the DJ was underwhelming.

Maybe I am being overly sensitive, but we had just expected more from your staff and business. We have friends who are planning weddings in the near future, and I would be hesitant to recommend you.",2020-01-14 20:54:32

Most of these bad reviews revolve around poor service, and I was feeling exceptionally patient yesterday so my husband and I gave it a go. 
When we arrived (Wednesday night 8:45 p.m.) it was very slow, I counted two other tables inside the restaurant when we entered but several people dining at the bar area. 
The guy who sat us (Zack) was also our server, so we were able to order drinks right away. This place makes a fantastic Shirley temple. I'm normally not a soda drinker and I finished my glass. 
Zach was courteous and competent. He brought us bread and even came back by with balsamic vinegar per our request. We ordered the mac and cheese bites appetizer with truffle sauce. So delicious (you can't go wrong with fried macaroni and cheese!) We also ordered mushroom ravioli. This has always been my favorite dish from Romanos, and it did not disappoint. In fact my husband mentioned he thought they added more mushrooms than usual and we love mushrooms. 
Our entrees came with Caesar salad. This is new or newer, in the past you always had to add a salad if you wanted salad with your entree. We were surprised when it came to the table since we had not ordered them, but Zack let us know they come with our entree. I'm not a huge fan of Caesar dressing but this salad was so delicious, the lettuce was crisp and cold, the dressing was creamy and it had the perfect amount of Parmesan cheese on top. We really enjoyed our meal here. Zack came by to check on us, offereing us dessert before bringing the check. We were so full after the bread, appetizer, salad and entree we had to decline on the dessert but based on how wonderful the rest of the meal was, next time I will save room! 

Don't let the bad reviews keep you from eating here! It is a chain restaurant but if you've eaten at Romanos before you know what to expect and they definitely meet the expectations at this location.

I took today off from work and called to see if I needed an appointment but they said it wasn't busy so I could come on in anytime (Wednesday at noon). 

I was greeted by Diamond and she told me about the manicures with dipping powder instead of gel. I decided to try it out! New day, new nail salon, new procedure! Mani-pedi day!

The salon was clean, they set me up in the massage chair, offered me a drink and Na came over for the pedicure. She was amazing! I got black gel on my toes and Diamond started working on the dipping for my nails all in the comfort of my massage chair. 

Dipping is like acrylic nails, come to find out, although healthier with the vitamin powder and can last up to 3 weeks. I picked a tanzanite blue/purple and Diamond shaped the nails to look very natural as dipping is layers of thickness once piled on. 

Na and Diamond were so sweet and friendly and the massage for my feet, legs and hands was Devine! This is my new nail salon! Great place!!",2019-04-10 18:02:05

I had a chocolate croissant which was awesome because it's extremely rare to find chocolate made without soy (which really gets on my nerves!!!). They also had some kind of marble bread on special that had a swirl of chocolate running through it. Very tempting indeed, but I resisted because I simply couldn't afford it.

The space is beautiful; walking distance to the dome jf you want to go before the game or easily accessible to an after work happy hour for people who work downtown. 

The menu is creative but maybe a little too ambitious and the kitchen seems to be a little sloppy. The best appetizer I've had is the lump crab deviled eggs which are served as 3 halves. Three. Not 4, not 2. This makes splitting awkward and every time I go I chuckle about not getting the remaining half. I've had the ratatouille which is hearty but despite all the different ingredients tastes like it's just oregano. This dish also led to unfortunate digestive issues later. The second time I visited it was for brunch and my crab cake Benedict, along with another persons dish, arrived with hard boiled eggs which were supposed to be poached. I stuck my fork in the egg expecting the yolk to come dripping out but instead the ball just rolled elsewhere on the plate. I felt bad, but I had to ask for another egg. Even though we were one of maybe 4 parties in the entire restaurant, by the time I got our servers attention the crab cakes were cold. The egg they brought me later was undercooked enough that I questioned if it would make me sick (the white still has clear parts in it) so I opted not to eat it.

It's not the cheapest meal, so I would plan accordingly before you start ordering everything on the menu (and trust me, you will definitely want to)",2021-08-11 14:21:29

Some might find that they're a little pricey but it's well worth your money especially the one that's the Caribbean way because it is actually a meal replacement smoothie, and trust me I would rather spend a little bit more for a smoothie that's going to be a meal replacement and keep me full.",2017-05-11 03:11:47

We searched for 6 months for the most perfect DJ for our wedding. We wanted to find someone who had experience, was charismatic, got the crowd up and moving, and can drive the wedding. We had invited 150 people and we needed someone who can entertain all those individuals. We asked friends and family and he came highly recommended from my husbands friends that just got married. Our initial meeting just blew me away. He asked all the right questions, asked for a detailed itinerary to go off of. He even spent two full hours one day meeting with us to go over the itinerary step by step and adding his thoughts and experience for smooth transitions. (I don't know anyone that would do that) The way he took charge at my wedding just completely blew me away!

The other two stations make salads or sandwiches. There's the option to order from the menu or make your own, pretty standard choices and most things on the menu contain meat so not a lot of choice for vegetarians.

This toast was two standard slices of bread from a grocery store loaf, so nothing special at all. Topped with ricotta cheese, pistachios and honey, it was filling but that's about all I can say. My lunch companion was equally as unimpressed with her egg sandwich. I ordered a hot tea, which was the standard tea bag in a paper cup of hot water. I assume the attraction here is the location, making it a place for surrounding business people to walk to for a quick meal. Definitely no reason to drive out of your way for a cafeteria style meal. Not a top banana and don't even get me started on the caviar 'cuz there's nothing fancy about this quick casual restaurant.",2019-10-23 13:21:02

Newly arrived in St. Pete, I contacted this temple. I zoomed a Fri night ""Kabbalat"" service during the month of April. It did NOT include L'Chor Dodi.  The Cantor, also Adult Education Director, a senior citizen, was asked to say the candle blessing for Shabbat. She looked surprised, said it, then said, ""Im glad I remembered it."" 
      I inquired about excluding L'Chor Dodi. The Rabbi emailed me to say that they have a very short Fri service (none on Sat morn) because members ""had a short attention span."" ""In April they had added a prayer to it so they had to cut a prayer out."" Are these people so ignorant, they do not know the significance of their act for a Fri night service?
      I volunteered to participate in Adult Ed, also run by the Cantor. I was informed that their next speaker would be a Police Chief talking about ""Profiles in Courage"" (the JFK title). I wrote her saying in the context of what is going on in the country, I found this topic choice to be ""strange"" and wondered why it was chosen for Temple. She responded with a terribly nasty, personal and slanderous attack against me. I reported this to the membership administrator who did nothing.
      If you are new to this area, avoid this place.

Plenty of indoor and outdoor shady seating and decent WiFi make this a good place to work. Nice music playing, from Beach House to Grizzly Bear. Great coffee - no pour-overs, but their drip coffee tasted fresh. It's from the Dart Coffee Co. (new to me) - lightly roasted Peruvian beans. Decent value too - I had a coffee, bagel with cream cheese and tomato, and muffin for about $9. Coffee refills are free, so I had a blueberry scone ($4) to go with the second cup ;) I have mixed feelings about their pastries. They all look good, and while the bagel tasted good, the muffin and scone were bland and both were a touch overdone. The muffin was listed as grapefruit poppy seed, and while the texture was good, there was no grapefruit flavor that I could detect. It was a Monday - perhaps an off-day?  Would recommend it for the coffee and ambiance, and I think the bakery side has potential - their baguette sandwiches look great.

I'm also giving Helena Avenue Bakery 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* Their coffee, from Dart, is certified fair trade and organic. 
* They use organic flour for baking, sourced from Central Milling
* They have ceramic cups and plates and metal utensils for eating in-house.
* Items like sandwiches have just a simple paper wrap.
* Even items that come in packaging (like house-made pickles) they have made fairly sustainable choices (cardboard and PET). 
* Cold drinks cups are compostable, although hot cups and lids are not. 
* Water is available in little glass jars. 
* The support some local charities and events such as bike to work day and Heal the Oceans.

PS: The address is a bit confusing: if you approach from Anacapa Street, make your way past The Lark and you'll find this bakery next to the SB Wine Collective.

I should add a disclaimer; I rarely hang out at Bier. I like the people and the atmosphere, but the beer is just too good, and I'm afraid said delicious beer will cause me to drive back home drunk! So, I nearly always get growlers, bullets, and/or cans to go. The mix-and-match cans option is a huge plus because, like Central State and some other local breweries, Bier is good at having a mix of house favorites and new experimental beers in cans at any given time. Standouts include PDG (a perfect pale ale), their ESB (which is unfortunately getting harder and harder to get since it is so coveted), Sabbath (a black Kolsch), last year's Marzen (the best canned Marzen on the planet), their legendary pumpkin ale (the best I've ever had), and a variety of other Belgian-style ales (they don't do exclusively Belgians, I just happen to like Bier's take on Belgians). I haven't even had their most famous beer, Sanitarium, but that's partially because I don't like boozy, barrel-aged beers (and also because it sells out so fast). This is one of the best breweries in Indiana, and likely the whole midwest. No flights, but they'll let you taste until you find something you like (which won't take long if you are a beer lover). They are also really active in the community and do countless fundraisers. I'm down to my last month in Indy, and this will be one of the places I miss the most!

Not only is it in Downtown Santa Barbara, but it is located in the trendy FUNK ZONE close to the wharf. Really, you could start your day here and walk to a whole lot of points of interest from here.

The egg, ham and cheese in a biscuit breakfast sandwich is so hearty and filling that you could split it into two, if you like light breakfasts, and be good to walk around for several hours after.

The biscuit is so buttery and flaky. The pesto sauce was so good. The cheddar was sharp.

The heirloom tomato galette, though not as heavy in the tummy is still large and filling.

They also serve very good espresso coffees and teas.

Outdoor dining was available - when it was allowed. Masks are required.

Street parking is plentiful in the morning, not so much in the afternoon.

Helena Avenue Bakery shares their space with a wine tasting shop. So the space is a bakery in the morning and a wine tasting shop at night. Great concept!

Also, there is a doggie bowl of water provided for your four-legged friends/kids.

I really wish I had the opportunity to go again during my trip here. When I come back to SB, I will sure try to come early so I can have breakfast here.",2020-12-27 23:41:14

We had a really good time, the food was tasty and the staff was professional.  I have read the other reviews and have to wonder if they went to a different restaurant.  Maybe there have been some changes made, I am not sure.

I had the grouper special, it was really good and came with a topping of steamed spinach.  The Greek salad was fresh and well dressed.  We also had the saganaki appetizer, it was nice and large and tasty.  The pita was hot and crispy.  My mom ordered the greek sampler appetizer and it was really good.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, even my picky toddler.  She had chicken fingers and they were not greasy or over breaded.

We did not experience any of the staff drama discussed in earlier posts, nor did we find the place full of hoosiers.  Then again, maybe I am a hoosier in denial.... lol.  It had a good mix of older patrons and a few young couples.  The bar is separated by a wall, and there were some groups in there having drinks.  Overall, a  pretty normal crowd for a Monday.  It is not an upscale restaurant, nor do they pretend to be upscale.  It is a comfortable neighborhood eatery.  They are putting in a patio area that looks like it will be nice once it warms up again.

We will definitely be back.  Our food was hot, tasty and prompt.  Our drinks were refilled often and when we asked for more pita, it came out fast and hot.  Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I have only been there the one time, so it is hard to claim perfection.",2012-10-30 14:43:23

The mushrooms were divine. The walu was so delicate with just a little spice. The spicy crab noodles had the best slightly chewy texture, the crab itself was a very fine texture and flavored the noodles, and it had just the right amount of heat in the back of your throat.

I emailed Chase about not finding any more details on there site for the interest I was going to be charged for being late.

So, it was just the two of us but we were not asked to be seated at any of the two bars and instead taken to the low tables at the right wing of the restaurant where I could tell families were placed.

I'm not a restaurant manager and I know organization is a big part of this but if you're a customer and waitresses are wandering around and you can't find yours if you ask the first you see for hot sauce or the check the least you expect is being told that she is not taking care of that table and wait.

My family and I went last night in an effort to celebrate being together for Christmas.  There were 8 of us,  all adults. 

We arrived and were seated at 6 pm.  Our drink order was taken.  Six waters were brought for the eight of us.  Our ordered drinks arrived after 6:30.  Three of eight drinks were wrong.  It took another 15 minutes to get this corrected and the two additional waters.  

We finished our drinks.  No additional orders were taken until our food arrived at 720, 80 minutes after we ordered.  

A second drink order was taken then. We all ordered the same thing to make it easier on the waiter.   These arrived some time later.  

The food was not good.  ""The New Edition"" was flavorless.  The pepperloin kababs were soaked in butter and nearly inedible.  

What was particularly galling about the experience was the service.  Our waiter was nice but incompetent.  The head waiter walked by our table multiple times,  could clearly see our empty glasses,  and never approached us.  The owner did as well.

It took 1 late payment after many years of me paying my card each month in full for them to report me and my credit score to drop from 800 to 750. The late payment was due to an error. My app was telling me I had 0 balance and it was only 1 month, not over by much. The chase specialist I talked to said that if payment is not received in 30 days it triggers automatically an alert, a bad mark on your payment history in the credit score. He said that they are not going to call each customer as a curtesy and he can't do anything about it. 

Folks, just AVOID CHASE. We can only stop big money, big banks, from treating us like this if we collectively at a grassroots level do not tolerate bad behavior. It took me years to build a good credit score, and right before making a big purchase, a house, these people ruin it just like that with their smart algorithms.  Extremely disappointed!!

Reservation was at 2pm & we were seated promptly & the table selection was perfect as we were placed in our own little section away from the rest of the crowd (this was a nice touch).

An hour later, after 3 prompting conversations with our nice enough waiter; the kids' orders finally came out.  This was a consistent theme throughout the experience; nothing came to our table without continued prompting & near begging.  Our 2 appetizers came out 1.5 hours after sitting down.  Finally, our 3 entrees came out; nearly 2 hours after sitting down.  Again, nothing came to our table until I requested/complained/implored the waiter to please bring something to the table.  

The food varied; most of the plates were pretty good, grilled salmon, crab cake sandwich, lobster blt tacos, & calimari; however; the east steamer pot; both the crab & mussels must have been sitting & over-steaming; just as we did the same....the crab & mussels were completely overdone & was a similar experience to chewing on your tongue.

A big counter for sandwich/sub making... and while there, that's all I saw them sell, I think maybe their main attraction is fresh baked breads for the their subs. 

Several of us ate their Lasagna (with meat sauce... seriously, just meat over top?!?)... not that flavorful or good.  Also an alfredo sauced cheese tortellini with chicken... had a strange spice and was watery... not good. Salad ""dressing"" was the best item we had. 

Bakery area... cookies ""looked"" good... sadly they seemed old, flavorless and had an aftertaste that made us realize they absorbed and picked up the odors of the business itself... YUK!!!

The admission is a few dollars cheaper than the one on Whyte but your also only getting one drink here as opposed to as many as you can drink during your visit. The drinks here are great though. The chai latte I had was far better than the watered down junk I used to get at Starbucks and who would really expect a high quality drink from a place where the drinks are not the main focus? It was a great surprise!

The cat room is really cute and homey although admittedly a bit small. My friend and I were the only customers for the hour that we were there though and it was so nice being able to love on all the cats and not have to deal with a horde of other patrons attempting to get their attention.

Things got off to an inauspicious start as we barely made our reservation and the host staff gave my wife a hard time about being alone as I refused to pay the going rate for parking nearby or the posted valet price ($5 self park is available, oops missed that). Once we finally got settled in, our server took over and he was outstanding. 

We ordered a bottle of wine and a number of dishes to share. Everyone raves about the spicy crab noodles and for good reason. Ours could have been a touch hotter in my opinion but once I had that first butter savory umami bite I couldn't part with it. I would come back here often just for this dish alone. We also fell in love with the Tebasaki gyoza. At first when they brought it to our table we were confused as we expected some traditional dumplings, but when our waiter explained how the dumpling filling is stuffed into the chicken wing we raised our eyebrows a bit, took a bite and were astounded at the taste and experience of such an innovative concept. It's hard to surprise me with food and yet this did. My wife still talks about this dish and for good reason. Mindblowingly amazing! We had the broccolini and shrimp dish as well which was fantastic, but compared to the other dishes we ordered, was not in the same stratosphere. Great but not innovative or life-changing. We had the cheapest steak on their menu, which in hindsight I wish I would have insisted on the wagyu or something, but my wife devoured the american steak and claimed it as her favorite steak for some time (I assume that excludes my weekly sous vide offerings). I found the steak befitting of the other dishes and the exquisite ambiance. As much as I enjoyed it, I would def order the crab noodles and gyoza again, but would be interested in trying a different steak next time. 

The restaurant is gorgeous, elegant and stately without being pretentious or overstated.

Ordered pasta to go with Italian sausage the cook forgot the sausage then we asked for it to be added and the cook added the sausage on cold almost a frozen cold we complained and the manager was extremely rude explained they're busy. Busy and slow is one thing throwing cold sausages on a warm to go dish is unforgivable.

Manager needs to go she can't manage and has a very bad attitude. People behind us were complaining because of slow service etc.


The vibe in the place from workers was no one wanted to work there we watched the cook grab her stuff and run out.

The churro donut, pesto asparagus salad, chocolate zucchini bread, peanut brittle cookie, chocolate chunk cookie, espresso, and so on. My all time favorite is probably the chocolate zucchini bread as it is so dense and flavorful while also tasting fresh and light on the digestive tract. The chocolate chunk cookie is a close second.

I haven't had many savory options here as they are pretty darn pricey for the portion size, however the couple I have had have been mighty tasty, fresh, and packed with the perfect combo of flavors. So in a sense, yes it's expensive but you are really getting what you pay for. They have many breakfast options that are served until 11 am then the lunch baguettes and side salads take over. 

Personally, I'd recommend this spot if you are looking for an artisanal breakfast with craft coffee and quality foods and/or sweets. It's also a nice spot for those wine tasting in the funk zone and want a little snack-a-roo between tasting rooms without walking too far and/or eating too much. 

Food is tasty, staff are kind, and the environment is adorable - The only downside to this spot for me is the prices. It would be a full 5 stars in my opinion if things were just a little more affordable. I'd also enjoy if they had a little more lunch options that didn't include so much bread in them or paying $10 for a few bites of delicious greens instead. Wraps would be awesome!

Thank goodness for the bread. Half order of butternut squash pasta with quite good if too rich. The calzone substitute was something I will not order again, not offensive though.

I'll admit to being a creature of habit, so no one that knows me would be surprised that tonight, absent the prodding of my wife or friends, I ordered items that I had before.  

I started with Grandmom's Wonton Soup because I needed something soothing.  I believe I tasted a very slight hint of vinegar in the broth.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but whatever it is, it provides a modern flare to the broth, to go along with the delicate and very tasty deconstructed wontons.  The dough used for the wontons is extremely light, and the sausage is more significant with great flavor.  My second course, the Wok Kampachi Ceviche, was not only as delicious as before, but this time the kampachi was a more generous serving than my earlier experience.  

Rather than a number of smaller dishes, tonight for my third course, I decided to order a larger entree.  The Salmon Shokiyaki proved to be just the right choice.  I like my cooked salmon to have a warm pink center, yet a slight crispness on the outside.  This dish was perfectly done with a warm pink center, slightly crisp, along with a glaze on it that I think may have been miso based.  I'm not sure about the glaze, but it doesn't matter because I'd order it again anyway.  

Between the food and a sampling of a few sake's, it was a great way to spend my free time.  At this restaurant, the only other thing I really wished they served might be an assortment of robatayaki.  Are you listening Ken?",2018-02-20 22:26:12

I told the waitress I was in the mood for ramen and she recommend the ""most traditional"" which was the shio wontonmen. I can't even describe how tasteless this ramen was, it had no flavor at all. It was cold noodles in a watered down wonton soup. I didn't finish either one, got our checks and left.

They keep some of the same types of staples (try the Weizengoot) and rotate in seasonal and special beers too.  We recently had the Pumpkin Ale and the Autumn Saison -- both really tasty.

The initial cost when purchasing your very own growler seems a bit steep, but just remember -- you can bring that dark, curvy, beautiful glass jug back in and fill it with 64oz of delicious liquid courage any time from that day forward... even on Sundays.  Heck -- especially on Sundays in Indiana. 

Rumor has it that they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and only offer pints on the weekends.  Maybe we are just lucky and always hit it on a day where pints are available?!?  Also have heard the food trucks are only available when pints are.  Hmmm... I need to buy a lottery ticket with my luck so far! 

A growler refill costs 12-14 bucks, depending on the variety (the Pumpkin is currently $14 while the staples are $12).  The only thing is -- you cannot drink from the growler on site.  They also offer a smaller glass to-go bottle called the ""Bullet"" (32oz) should 64oz seem a bit much.

Another bonus is that they have had a different food truck parked outside each time we have gone.  They have ranged from gourmet Mac-N-Cheese to Some Guys Pizza (the Greek was uhh-mazing), to comfort food (fried catfish, pulled pork).  A nice addition when the munchies strike and they don't mind if you bring it inside to enjoy with your pint.

There are comfy couches and a TV -- looks and feels like a little community living room in the middle.  There are also tables to sit at and the restrooms are clean.  You can even buy cute/funny TShirts should you choose.

My advice: 
1.  Get your complimentary samples when you arrive -- 3 per person or 6 samples total for 2 people -- so bring a friend and share the wealth.  
2.  Pick a pint to enjoy on site.  
3.  Take a growler to go.

Friends and I met up here to take advantage of their attractive Monday specials[1]: their ""Buck-a-Shuck"" special meant raw oysters were a mere $1. We indulged in half-off appetizers, $4 classic mojitos - surprisingly good, with a kick - and $1 PBRs.

At the bar, bartender Mario[2] paid a lot of attention to us. Shared a huge, awesometastic assortment of thirty (30) oysters, trying about EIGHT different varieties, freshly shucked in front of us, and were some of the best I've had in recent memory. While sklorking them down, we watched the Olympics on flat screen TVs, then washed everything down with a few oyster shooters full of vodka. Mmmm.

Doc Magrogan's has lots of seating, and outdoor tables too. As more folks showed up, we were corralled into a side dining room. Meghan, our brave, sole server, somehow managed to serve the twenty of us.

What I found was that this place was a nice little mom and pop joint where there was a sense of simple foods but in a contemporary area.
I've had my fare share of korean food while in philly, Los Angeles, New York and houston.
Honestly speaking. . . It is a standard price for korean food. A little higher than other joints. In all I spent over 15 dollars for a bowl of beef bibimpop and veggie pancake.
First the pancake. I didn't like that it was very eggy compared to all that I have tried. It lacked crispness and it lacked. . . Flavor. It was as if it was reheated, although I'm not sure. It wasn't hot and it wasn't crunchy and it wasn't tasty.
As for my bibimpop I wasn't impressed. It was very standard for 11 bucks. The veggies were assorted and it tastes exactly what it looks like, if you want the crispy bowl it jacks up to 12 bucks. I've been to many joints and I would say this caters to the not so asian crowd.",2018-08-09 02:31:15

I also also had the winstons heat and rave street cocktails. Here are the issues, the winston's heat could have been more strain for a cocktail. While I love cucumber, there were way too many bits in the cocktail (see photo). The service was subpar. The waiter explain that he had ""forgotten"" about our salad order after nearly 35 minutes of waiting. My part visited during lunch and there must not have been more 10 people attending during our time. Ironically the salad was the best part of the meal. The ginger dressing was delish but maybe a bit over dressed. I found the rolls to be entirely too fishy and not too flavorful. Also call me skeptic, but I don't like the boxes that the sushi is served in. The little wooden rates and obviously hard to clear because we could see debris under our rolls. That is inexcusable especially during a time for a heightened need for cleaning. I was hoping this would be a new sushi gem in philly but it was just underwhelming.",2021-03-27 02:57:26

That's something I've never seen before but apparently it's a custom at legitimate Japanese establishments, especially higher budget ones. Our server was very polite and the whole place gave off a formal vibe. I definitely wouldn't come here on a whim in your Wednesday Worst but don't feel pressured to come in a suit or dress. Anyways, the menu items were expectantly  priced for the type of venue Green Pheasant was. I don't think anything was below $10 and one of their entrees was around $25 per ounce (minimum of 4 ounces per order) for examples. Even though the price can be a bit steep, the food was well worth it and tasted delicious. You get an adequate and satisfying portion unlike some more higher end places so you don't feel like you paid for one little piece of meat or lettuce.

There are a couple younger girls who do a good job helping the customer but the older women in the store aren't helpful at all and are actually even a little rude.  There is a huge quality control issue with the clothes they stock.  The sizing and quality of the uniforms vary greatly so you can't go by the size listed on the labels.  A so called youth medium uniform meant to fit girls in grade PK-2 fit like a huge sack while the small was tight yet the staff insisted the size was correct ( it did fit my 8th grader though but would have been a little too short ).  Another quality issue concerns the color consistency of some of the polo shirts.  One purchased earlier looked nice while at a later date when looking for more shirts, the same color looked faded.

So loaded up the family in the minivan and made the pilgrimage to the city and met up with two other of my girlfriends' families. This large industrial building is spacious and has a convenient location in Delaware Avenue and had lots of free parking around.  Outside they had some outdoor seating and a chicken coop, rabbit hutch and a little garden area with tables. 

Inside was ginormous and there were many large tables for big groups available to choose from.  We easily found a table for 8 kids and 6 adults.  The lower level had a play area for the kids and another bar.  There was a play structure to climb on, basketball game, tetherball, some video games (Mario, Kirby, etc), mini skew ball, a telephone booth, picture booth and a broken pinball and  broken shuffleboard table.  The kids area was definitely fun but if you look closely it didn't seem very safe or thought out.  Like the basketball game near the slide opening.  My daughter got nailed in the head.  The metal tether ball on a stage surrounded by concrete seemed a bit sketch.  I was a little anxious letting my kids play there.  

I did not have any beer on this visit but the group's consensus was that the beer was just OK.  We did order fries, pretzel with pimento cheese, the mussels, some pizzas and some collard greens.

After trying nearly all of the bakeries around Chinatown, this is probably my favorite.  First of all, the staff is very nice and helpful.  I wish I knew their names because I'd like to give proper credit to the staff, but the lady who speaks English without an accent is so friendly.  Every time I stop in she'll say hi and ask how I'm doing with a big smile.  I really feel like I'm a regular at this point.  I once came with my mom and now she's always asking how my mom is and when's the next time she'll be back.  

On to the buns.  I've tried most of the items available at the bakery.  There's a wide assortment of sweet and savory buns, desserts, and prepackaged steamed buns ready to go.  I'm really obsessed with Chinese style dried shredded pork, so I always have to get either the 'pork over bun' or the rolled up bun with green onion and dried pork any time I walk by.  To someone without much Chinese bakery experience this may sound weird but you have to give it a try, such a great balance of sweet, salty, savory, decadence.  Everything else for sale is also top notch.  I was lucky enough once to grab some egg tarts that were literally straight from the oven and I have to say at that point they were the best I've ever had in my life.  

They also have an assortment of hot and cold drinks available, but I don't have much experience with those.  All in all this is a must-go if you are wandering around Chinatown.  Stop in for a bun or a dessert.  It's a great treat, from an exceptional staff, and it definitely won't break the bank.",2016-03-01 15:27:01

I called and spoke with a customer service rep and then to her manager. They both informed me that there was absolutely nothing that Chase was willing to do to reduce my rate. (Even though I've never missed an on-time payment in 17 years). 
Also, somewhere around 2006 or 2007, they abruptly changed their minimum payment from something like 1.5% of the balance to 5%. For anyone carrying a balance, that was a significant increase. I believe they lost a class action lawsuit for that bad move.
Steer clear of this company!! Other creditors are more than willing to carry on reasonable conversations and negotiate rates. I live in Southern California and there are brand new Chase locations popping up everywhere. If they are dealing with consumers with such poor business tactics, no wonder there is so much money available in their own pockets to build all these locations.",2014-02-26 23:22:59

Upon arrival the restaurant was dimly lit and smelled delicious. We were seated at a table by the window. Our server, Jason, promptly brought hot towels. I thought it was a nice touch.

After reviewing the wine menu we decided to go with a bottle of Italian red. 

For an appetizer we ordered the pheasant dumplings. These things were AMAZING. Tangy and not to filling, we absolutely destroyed them instantly.

For the entree we decided to go with the Japanese wagyu with a side of roasted cauliflower. I highly recommend these delicious cuts of beef if you decide to come here. It arrived on a slate platter with 4 optional topics. We sprinkled the salt and pepper over the top and began to enjoy. The wagyu was everything I hoped and dreamed for it to be. Thinly sliced with a charred exterior, we went with rare plus, every piece was savory and delicious. It was like candy. The pictures do not do it justice!

Menu: short, curated categories of small plates, sashimi/sushi by the piece, and rolls 

Tasting notes:
-Wok kampachi ceviche: fish was thinly sliced, lightly seared on one side, a means for picking up the strongly ginger, salty sauce; this was very much of a light but absolutely lovely appetizer
-Lobster fried rice: tender pea shoot leaves among extremely umami shiitake mushroom slices and bite-sized chunks of sweet lobster; rice was not too oily and on the chewier side; a very shareable dish
-Mai fried rice: small pieces of sweet, meaty sausage contrast with the refreshingly crisp chopped snap peas and surprisingly large, full shrimp; mixing in the runny fried egg added a subtle creaminess; cilantro is the garnish, an fyi for people who might be like me and not love the flavor
-Yellowtail house roll: kept simple with yellowtail and avocado with a little bit of garnish, very clean-tasting
-Fishtown roll: basically a rainbow roll with crunchy, sweet, firm shrimp tempura wrapped inside with a mayo sauce; the size of each piece and the ratio of fish on top to the rest of the bite (rice, shrimp) was perfect for me

Noteworthy:
-Server was very attentive and friendly and great at explaining the night's specials, down to where the seafood was sourced
-Booths good for groups and cafe-style round tables for date nights

The drinks here were strong and I quite enjoyed them. I tried the Winston's heat, which was very much cucumber-y and refreshing, the NORI-Grets, which basically tasted like a margarita, and the Yuzu sour, which was a bit too sour for me. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes for the table, which came to around $400 with tip and tax. 

Things I'd recommend:
1. UNI: the uni here was surprisingly fresh (compared to a lot of their other fish). While MP was $12 a piece, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Not sure if the UNI is always this fresh, but we definitely came on a good day. 

2. Vegetable fried rice: I'm sure all the fried rices here are good (they have 3 different choices in total, a sausage one, a crab wasabi one, and a veggie one): We opted for the veggie rice and it was delicious - Super simple, but full of flavor. A bit greasy, but definitely a delicious and straightforward dish. 

3. Grandma's Wonton soup: I didn't try this, but this was a dish ordered for my grandmother (we thought a grandma soup would be good for a grandma lol). She really enjoyed this! These are Fuzhou style wontons so they're super small, but she ate this entire dish and that doesn't happen often - so they must've been authentic and delicious! 

Things I thought that were just OKAY: 
1. The rolls: We ordered the eel avocado, California, avocado, and peanut avocado roll (lots of avocado lol). While they were pretty solid (was personally not a big fan of the peanut avocado roll), I'd say it really wasn't anything special. I guess they presented it in an aesthetic way, but definitely not any better than the regular $5 lunch special rolls at a random sushi joint. If you're a fan of sushi rolls, their rolls are definitely a safe option to order but again, they won't wow you. 

2. Oysters: My mom actually really enjoyed the oysters, so this might be a preference thing. They weren't bad by any means but I definitely didn't like that the oysters were pre-seasoned and flavored. Whenever places do that it naturally makes me question the oyster freshness. We ordered 12 oysters in total, 6 East coast and 6 west coast. The oysters were around $3, which I thought was pretty pricey - especially because dollar oysters are pretty easy to find. I pay for $3 in NYC when I've missed happy hour and am REALLLLLLLY craving oysters, otherwise I can't really justify the price - especially in Philadelphia and for the size/taste of these oysters. Again, not bad but not worth it in my book. 

3. Seaweed salad: We ordered this for my grandmother who's pretty picky with what she eats. It tasted like standard seaweed salad. Not really sure what else to say about this one. 

Things I'd skip: 
1. Tuna tartare: My cousin mentioned this was a dish that was pretty popular here so we decided to try it. Tuna didn't taste very fresh. 

2. Big tuna sashimi: Tuna, again, didn't taste fresh. I'm confused why this place is called tuna bar when their tuna doesn't seem...great. Our waiter described this as an ""omakase"" but we chose to order and share with the table. The best part of this plate was the tuna rolls. The sashimi slices were fishy and honestly the color of the fatty tuna made me feel, for lack of better words, A BIT FISHY, about this place. 

OVERALL, this place is a fun time and has a great atmosphere. Their fish and tuna truly is...whatever, but I'd still recommend this spot for a nice date or hangout with friends / family.",2021-09-12 13:29:58

The waitresses are very nice, and the food comes out very quickly.  Yesterday when I went I noticed alot of families are there to eat. There are a ton of TV's with different sporting games being played. If you order an appetizer wait a minute to order your meal because the food comes out that fast.  I like to take my time eating my appetizer.  
The food so yesterday I got the loaded potato soup and it was so, so good. I asked for green onions on the side to add to my soup.  That soup was so good not salty at all.  It had fresh bacon, potatoes and cheese.  
We also order fried pickles which was enough pickles to feed 4 people.  It comes with ranch,  and they were not greasy at all.  They were a mild flavor pickle so not tart.  I had the cheeseburger and added bacon for .99 cents.  The bacon is a nice thick cut of bacon.  The burger comes with lettuce,  tomato,  grilled onions, and mustard. The bun did break apart on the bottom for some reason. The patty is a thick piece of meat and it was very good.  
I will definitely go back I would like to try their Cuban sandwich.  I was going to get it but she said it's on a hoagie bun.  I would like to see if they can do that sandwich on their Texas toast they serve with the soup.  
Lastly,  I would like to see this restaurant have the tables/ bar top table more spread.  It's like part of the restaurant is social distancing and part of it is not. They are located in Marion County so the capacity should be less according to the Governor rules.  The restaurant both times has been packed with every table filled.

I ordered a little strawberry custard pastry and took a chance on their tea-making skills. My husband opted for a drip coffee.

It's a really lovely setting, and you can see into the kitchen inside. Friendly service. Most everything you need (water, stir sticks, sugars, etc) are all accessible and they give you a number to take to your table.

We sat outside with our pastries and my tea came out within a few minutes. It's a loose leaf blend. As far as I could tell it was good quality tea... but they served a miniscule amount in a huge bowl of a cup. Like, less than a teaspoon full. So even after leaving it to infuse for a long time there was barely any color or flavor to it. I couldn't be bothered to chase it up so I just drank it. The rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per cup, plus one for the pot. Obviously this wasn't in a pot but a heaping teaspoon is still required for a regular cup, so a big mug like this could use 2.

The pastry was heavier than it looked, more like a cinnamon roll with custard and strawberry than a butter pastry. It was nice, a good size, fresh fruit, not too sweet. 

Really lovely setting and overall a decent experience, but it did fall below my expectations a little bit. I know tea is tricky but if you're making the effort to serve a nice loose leaf, it's worth serving it correctly.",2019-11-26 17:59:23

Its not a big place, so get ready to get cozy with your fellow ice cream lovers. The Building is deep and long, not wide, so when you walk in you have to walk to the back of the building to get to the ice cream line. On my visit, the line was out of the door, which apparently seems to be the usual with this place, so be prepared for a wait. However, the wait was not terrible and the line moved really quick. I will say it took us about 15 minutes to get from the sidewalk to the register. 

Ill be completely honest here...I walked into Mike's with every intention of getting a cup of ice cream, two scoops actually, but ended up walking out with a cookies and cream handmade milkshake. Do I regret my choice? Absolutely not! Did I still end up sampling an ice cream before making my choice, yup! So, technically I can speak to multiple products that Mike's has to offer!

In addition to their homemade local ice cream, Mike's also offers a variety of coffee drinks, assorted danishes, milk shakes, brownies, old fashioned sodas and frozen drinks such as lemonade. As mentioned above, I ended up with a cookies and cream milkshake and it was delish! They offer the basics of milkshake flavors from vanilla, chocolate, etc...or you can choose any flavor ice cream they serve to have a shake made out of. Speaking of their ice cream, they have a plethora of flavors for you to choose from, upwards of 20-25 when the case is fully stocked! Of course they have the staples such as chocolate chip cookie dough, mint chocolate chip, vanilla and chocolate; but additionally, they have some really creative and tasty flavors such as blueberry cornbread, chocolate banana pudding, superhero and many more! I ended up sampling the blueberry cornbread, because you don't see that flavor listed and at least sample it! I enjoyed it, but my heart had already fell for a milkshake. 

In addition to the treats themselves, everyone that worked there was genuinely nice, patient and helpful in all interactions I was involved in and that I witnessed. Overall, I can tell why this place is jam packed at all times! It is certainly on my recommendation list and ""return to"" list for my next trip to Nashville!",2019-03-30 23:20:31

After 2 years of having a Chase credit card I decided that I wasn't using it much and decided to cancel the card.  I notified Chase that I was cancelling the card.  They did not cancel the card.  For the next few months I got a bill that had an unsupported charge.  The section of the bill that I used to get that showed the specific charges had been omitted but the total bill had increased from zero to over $600.00.  

I wrote the company and asked for the itemized bill so that I could see what charges they were referring to.  They not only didn't do this but their letter to me said it wasn't possible for them to identify the charges and their sources.  I refused to pay them anything until they documented the bill(s).  Then they sent in a derogatory report to the 3 credit bureaus.  This violated the Fair Credit Billing Act in three different ways.

At present, I am preparing to submit my case to a class-action litigator law firm so that they can stop Chase from bothering me and any other innocent parties who are being swindled by Chase.

i was here recently for a friends birthday, and it's a great place to go to to celebrate! it's very nice and fancy, and the food and drinks are pretty good too. the price point is a bit high, so i personally would only go here for special occasions 

i split a charcuterie board and rose sangria with the table, and the my were both delicious! the 3 meats, 3 cheeses board was *just* enough for 6 people and had some really tasty meats and cheeses. we did have a cheddar that was super sharp, and i think that was the only cheese that didn't get fully eaten 

the rose sangria was delicious! it came with a lot of ice though - like A LOT - probably because they want to give you less alcohol... it was super good but about 65% of our pitcher was ice, which is not so good

i got the croque madam for my main dish, and it was good but the ham and sauce were both a little too salty for my taste personally. but i had a bite of my friend's wagyu burger and it was so so good! cooked super well and also very well seasoned

Pros:
-- Cheap prices! Almost every baked good is under $1
-- The ladies who work here are so friendly and always smile
-- Very consistent with almost always getting ""fresh out of the oven warm"" baked goods
-- Get to practice my Cantonese!

Cons:

But there's where it ended, he proceeded to dump us on a new hire, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with but she was sooo new, like second day new. She continually had to ask questions and rather than someone coming over to help here, they answered her questions from across the room while eating hoagies. It left me with little confidence that my glasses were going to be correct. 

I purchased a new set of prescription sunglasses that turned out pretty good, so I am happy with them, its my regular glasses that they really goofed on. I have a pair of glasses that I love and I got them about a year prior at a different Lenscrafters location and rather than spend the money on a new frame, I had them just replace the lens. When I picked them up everything seemed fine but over time they got looser and looser and when I tried to tighten them, I found out that they somehow bent the arm. The screw will no longer attach into the frame, of course this was long after the one month warranty expired. Needless to say I wasn't really happy with their handiwork. 

I know these places have a terrible turn over and I don't think I will be shopping there again. Next time I will be looking for a locally owned store with a bit more attention to service and their craft.",2010-05-10 13:44:57

I only went two times before this last time and I had all mixed feelings about it. My first time was amazing. My second time was not so great but I did get a cute birthday pic in the bathroom.

Anyways, I met up with a friend from out of town at this place and was super excited. Of course, I looked up the menu that morning and decided what I would get. You also have to decide what you and that person can share too (foodie tip: if the person you go to lunch with doesn't mind splitting things, then do it!) Get separate plates and go ahead and cut things down the middle. Usually their sandwiches already come cut!

We got the lump crab deviled eggs, LA crawfish grilled cheese, the goat cheese and fig flatbread, and the soup of the day. It was alot of food but so good. HIGHLY recommend the LA crawfish grilled cheese. It comes with fries that are just too good to pass up. Also, ask to sit on the patio.

There was a 30000 miles benefit deal for applying for the card so I did so. About 10 days after I had applied for the card and been approved I received a mailed offer from United for 50000 miles for the same card! I called Chase and explained that I would prefer to have the 50000 mile benefit card. The customer service rep was very nice and emailed my request to his supervisors. Today I received a letter from Chase that they would honor the 50000 miles offer- given I meet the requirement of spending $2000 on the card over 3 months instead of the $1000 requirement to get the 30000 miles over the same time period!!!

It's a beautiful restaurant, the food and service was great and their specials were amazing. The ambience is perfect for a date night. We ordered the brussel sprouts which were nicely charred and doused in sweet and salty sauce, and the tuna tartare which isn't a super unique dish but it was done very well and it came with rice crackers to serve as a vehicle for the tuna. We also went with some happy hour rolls of spicy tuna, salmon avocado which were $5 each then a peanut avocado roll as well for $6. The peanut avocado roll is so simple and so good. I actually ordered a second one I liked it so much. I've had spicy tuna at more places than you can count, and this is exactly what you want when ordering spicy tuna. You can tell a restaurant knows what it's doing by the rice. Tuna bar knows what it's doing. Again, these aren't super original, but just done very well and a bit more refined than your typical fusion restaurant. We finished the meal with some Mochi for dessert that had 3 flavors and they were all delicious.

Since there's a lack of happy hour info on Yelp, here's the down low on their happy hour. This could be the best happy hour deal in the whole city. It's Mon-Fri from 4:30-7. Drink options are: one sake (mine was only $4 and poured traditionally overflowing into a masu box), one house red and one house white wine for $7. We went with the white and it was pretty good. You have the options of 3 beers, Kirin, Kirin Lite, and Orion for $5, $4, $4 respectively. Then there's one rotating house cocktail for $7. The night we went, it was a gin martini made with craft vermouth which is a ridiculous deal for just $7. Judging the way they handled the sake alone I'm sure their bar program is excellent. I will return to confirm this.

Happy hour food: 3 rolls for $5 each, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and Salmon Avocado. There's also chicken and shrimp dumplings for $7, edamame for $4 and shrimp and oysters for $2 a piece. 

Bonus tip: (as far as I know) every Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday. Spicy tuna rolls are $6 all day and tuna tartare is $7. Every Thursday is Toro Thursday. Negitoro rolls are $7 all day. 

Just come try this place for a happy hour, you'll never want to leave.",2018-12-05 15:08:42

Last night I decided to try a new UberEats offering, Copper Vine. The menu via UberEats is pared down from what I see on their main website. Not sure if that's an app limitation, or just an inventory issue when I placed the order. In any case, what was offered seemed very appealing to me and my family. We ordered two of their take on the Impossible Burger, their Waygu Beef Burger, their Copper Vine Cuban sandwich, and the Baby Herbs Salad. After placing the order, my wife and I went back to the distraction of streaming TV. After probably 20 minutes or so, I got an alert from my UberEats driver that there was an issue and he would be delayed. I called the restaurant and was told that the chef wasn't happy with the presentation of one of my entrees and was remaking it. I thought to myself, ""Wow, perfection during a pandemic. That's a good sign."" ... and I have to say I was more than happy with the food. When it did arrive a short while later, my family was more than happy with the quality and presentation of the food.

It's SO good and I've noticed that the majority of other patrons order the salad too. I get the BYO salad for $13 and they give you a huge portion so it's def worth it.

Currently, this is the only beer garden in the city that has a dog park so we were really excited to see what it has to offer. When we arrived, the dog park looked pretty crowded so we decided to grab a couple of drinks in the outdoor dining area.

There were other patrons dining outside with their dogs and it was a nice environment except for the occasional loud motorcycles on Columbus Blvd.

My husband placed our drink orders and a dog biscuit through contactless ordering. Our order arrived not long after. The drinks were all right. The dog biscuit was huge, which was great, but it was so hard to break into pieces and chew that we decided against giving it to our pup.

We also noticed many small shards of broken glasses on the ground in the outdoor dining area. A dog could easily have stepped on it and gotten hurt. My husband and the family from a neighboring table picked up the pieces of glass and removed them from the area but I'm very upset about this.

Mike's was the only place to come up on Yelp for having virgin lemonades but the second I got there and saw all the amazing ice cream orders I immediately changed my order to a root beer float. 

Turns out it was National Root Beer Float day anyways so #Winning on my part. They make the soda there in shop with syrups, I believe, and their ice cream is locally made. I got the Caramel Cone in my float and man was it perfect. It was a very generous scoop with such thick consistency that even the carbonation couldn't puncture. I would 100% order again. Next time around I'll try an orange soda with orange sherbert as someone in front of me ordered that and it sounded/looked absolutely fantastic. 

Mike's is nationally famous for their ice creams being featured in People magazine and on Rachel Ray. They are known for their legendary blackberry cornbread and having the widest variety of coffee and espresso drinks in downtown Nashville.

The event was held upstairs, and there were plenty of open tables on the dining room floor.

We got there at 5:10 and were put on the waitlist for the Ramen off. At around 5:25 we went up to the hostess stand (there were 3 hostesses) and asked if we could be taken off the list for the event and just dine in downstairs. The hostess asked us to hold on a ""moment"" and she would seat us. 20 minutes rolls by and it looks like she has no intention to seat us. I asked another hostess who said she couldn't seat us until the person who controlled the seating was back and she was currently on the phone. Again, at least half or more of the tables are open. Another 10-15 minutes till around and that second hostess seats us, in the back of the dining hall, without any apology or care we had to wait for over 30 minutes to sit. I also didn't understand why we were seated in the back when there were plenty of open tables in the front of the restaurant. 

Our service was decent but I felt like she was in a rush. I understand it might have been stressful because an event was taking place upstairs.

The cocktails are good depending on what you get, but I don't know if they're ""$14 good."" 

The food we ordered was the Tuna Tartare (it was excellent, and my favorite), the Shumai dumplings (my friend liked these, I didn't care for them), the hash browns (these were also very delicious and a nice spin on a traditional American food), and the spicy crab noodles (also pretty good).

All in all, the food is good, the restaurant is beautiful, but for me I appreciate an overall experience and if I feel like a burden to the staff I guarantee you I won't come back no matter how good the food can be.

They state it's homemade ice cream and the anticipation was increasing as the people were walking out with their ice cream cones in hand. Even on a day where the temps were near 50 the place just lured you in on many levels. Waiting in line for 25' left me to wonder if it will be worth it and let me tell you folks it was. 
There are a few tables inside to sit and enjoy your treat but they are snagged up before people get their cold treats. They do not have tables or chairs outside so it's pretty much walk and lick once you get you order. 
The price isn't that bad. $3,60 for a single scoop but it's generous.  They have a menu board for you to look at while in line and if they run out of a flavor, which happens a lot when standing in line, it is immediately deleted from that board. So don't get your hopes up that you will get that blueberry cheesecake flavor. They have the standard flavors and then they have their own concoctions. Once at the counter you do realize you pay extra for everything. Come 30 cents, waffle 99 cents etc. they can do shakes floats boats etc. you can also taste test flavors if you're not sure. Sorry there aren't any soy based flavors so for this lactose intolerant sweetie I wasn't able to get any.  But my daughter did. She chose the standard cookies and cream and cookie dough. I did taste the blueberry cheesecake and it was the creamiest and cold just the right hardness ice cream I've ever had. You could tell they have perfected the art of ice cream making. My daughters visual had huge chunks of Oreo and cookie dough packed inside the luscious creamy ice cream. 
They did sell other things like coffee and fruit shakes but I didn't see one person walk away with those in hand. In fact the coffee is kept in a carafe and you get it on your way out. So there isn't a great deal of selling other menu items going on. 
I would recommend stopping here anytime you're visiting. It is worth the wait and the price is pretty good. The staff is also very friendly and they have patience with the masses. Now go enjoy that treat.",2018-04-04 14:48:52

This is where I received what will forever be known as ""the physically impossible sandwich""... and it sucked. 

I ordered the meatball sandwich, just looking for something simple that's impossible to screw up. How can you screw up a meatball sandwich? Well, these knuckleheads found a way. 

On the plate placed before my lay two large meatballs, a bowl of sauce and two two-inch thick slabs of bread... OK, so what the bejesus am I supposed to do with this? There was no sandwich, but materials to assemble a sandwich... but that would be impossible. If I assembled said sandwich, the sandwich would be like 5 or 6 inches thick. 

My wife suggested cutting the meatballs into quarters to reduce the potential disaster ratios that lay before me... Didn't work. Still two thick for any human without a disjointed jaw. Hmmmm... Maybe open faced?... no, too messy and the meat to bread ratio was still off... Maybe try to cut the bread length wise? Now we're just getting silly.

So, after 10 or 15 minutes of trying to figure out how to eat the $9 sandwich that wasn't even a sandwich, I came to grips with the fact that the reason my non-sandwich sandwich was not served to me as a sandwich was because it was physically impossible.

How do we even define what a sandwich is? ... I'm not going there. 

So, I ate the ingredients separately - and it was mediocre at best. Worst was the bread. Incredibly bland and dry. I commented to my wife that it could make decent home insulation material. 

My wife had lasagna and suspected it had been frozen and microwaved.

All said and done, our bill was like $40... for two pieces of bread, two meatballs, two beers, and microwave lasagna.

And that's not with the labor and frustration of me contemplating ""the physically impossible sandwich.",2014-10-19 01:39:36

CHASE Creates Pandemic with min payment increase
Complaint Rating:

Comments  United States  Credit Cards
On December 14, 2010 I attempted to purchase a Christmas gift for my wife, but my Chase VISA card was rejected. When I called Chase I was told that I exceeded my credit limit.I knew that my limit was approximately 16K and that I had just paid $5800, which would have allowed my extra purchasing power.
After speaking with a customer service person who was rude and ignorant, possessing no listening skills, I spoke with a supervisor, Brandon *******, who also tried to explain the reason for the reduced limit.
For the 10th time, I told him that I wasn't calling about that, and I did not care about the reason.
My complaint was that I was not notified that my credit limit was reduced. Mr. ******* said that I would be notified in a day or two. Eleven days before Christmas you take my ability to purchase gifts away from my without advising me. This must be a violation of some standard.
Oddly enough, today (December 20, 2010) I received the notice (copy enclosed).
You can be assured I'll be closing my account.

Had a trip scheduled for June 2020 and had given a downpayment to a merchant to secure the booking. Due to current events we had to cancel the trip. The merchant was unwilling to give back the downpayment even though we were cancelling two months in advance. Their refund policy was very clear if we cancelled a week prior we were due a full refund. I initially disputed the charge with Chase. The merchant asked us to drop the dispute so that they could refund the money. I called Chase and asked if it was OK to drop the dispute - they said yes that was Ok. The Chase representative said it the merchant still did not refund I could re-dispute the charges. Once the dispute was dropped the merchant was still not going to give the refund - they tricked us. I contacted Chase and they refused to re-dispute the money. We were lied to by Chase. I want to warn others that Chase does not protect its clients. I would highly recommend that you never get a Chase credit card - they do not support their customers. I am now responsible for over $1000 in charges that I should not have to pay because Chase does not support its customers and also lies to its customers. I will never work with Chase Bank again.,2020-07-09 22:11:51

You hear nothing but country music and rock and roll. There are times when there are literally 65-70% black and Latino customers and all you hear is music that caters to whites. There have slowly added women of color to the team of waitresses but they don't seem to stick around very long. One night, my friends and I came in for fight night and the place was jammed packed. They took our money at the door and there were no seats available for us to sit in. So we had to stand and hope that four people would leave so that we could be seated. Managers were rude when we asked about it. Probably because there were cops with them that were working in the building that night which is not surprising. We finally spot a table of four leaving and then four guys that had just walked in the building and who just so happened to be white men hurried up and sat at that table and we told them that we were there before they were and management told us that they were there before we were. We knew this wasn't true but it put us all in a potentially bad situation. We are not trouble makers but we were very angry. Especially since all they had to do is write down names at the door and keep track of tables. We saw a waitress arguing with another group of black men for the same reason at the same time and they told us the same thing had happened to them. The point of this review is this: Far too many times black people are treated as if their money is different. The music reflects that and the service does as well. We need to have our own establishments but the city wouldn't allow this to happen due to the ""good old boy system with land and properties"".

The visits to the gravesites were cool and we got to visit the hurricanes Katrina memorial as well. Biggest reason I rated this tour so low is because of the people. They were ALL SO DRUNK. Because they allowed drinks on the ride and it was a 930 tour I did, everyone was so wasted. They were obnoxious. Had to make others wait for a unplanned bathroom stop because they were so wasted.

They were being verbal on the bus and talking crap to each other when we got off of the bus for the tour stops.

The herbed mushroom pasta only came with a poached egg, so I decided to add the shrimps for some protein. Big mistake. I love salty food, but the grilled shrimps were just too way salty. The mushroom pasta itself tasted delicious. Maybe that's why I should not add any extra topping.

Our remaining 2 party members arrived and were told not only could they not enter the establishment but they could not sit with us because the rules prevent more than 6 people at an inside table.

I made my reservation for a party of 6 two months ago after hearing incredible reviews from co-workers and friends. I was eagerly anticipating a first class experience, an upscale version of another local favorite,Two-Ten Jack. Unfortunately, due to the restaurant management's incompetence and extremely rude and unprofessional attitudes, I left this establishment very disappointed. 

Our reservation was at 7:30pm, and when we arrived, the hostess informed us that our table ""was being cleared now"" and to take a seat at the bar for a few minutes. After a quick bathroom break, our party ordered a round of drinks from the bar to help us maintain our patience as the minutes melted off of the clock. After 20 minutes of waiting; I approached the host to inquire about the delay in seating. The response was gruff, he rudely informed me that a previous party was still closing out at the table and we would have to continue to wait. I then asked if he would comp our first round of drinks; and again the response was rude and unprofessional- ""It's out of my control....Sir!"" the manager exclaimed as he shook his head and walked towards the kitchen. 

My party and I continued to wait; ordering a second round of drinks while the waitstaff struggled to get their act together. 50 minutes later, at 8:20pm, the manager finally moped back to the bar; mumbling as he led us upstairs to a completely different section of the restaurant. Before we headed upstairs, I asked him what he would do to help rectify the situation. ""The first round of drinks is on me, but I will NOT cover the second."" Ridiculous.... 

Once we were seated, I must confess that the remainder of our time was quite enjoyable. From our friendly waiter, Spencer, delicious small plates, and smooth Japanese Whiskey- the second act of the night met my expectations. The heated toilet seats were also a big hit with the ladies. However, none of these positives could cleanse my palate of the sour taste left over from the management's poor demeanor. We shook our heads as we departed; disheartened. I truly believe that the Green Pheasant could fly high with the best of them, as long as it's management stopped clipping it's own wings.",2019-11-03 17:52:14

We came in on a Saturday and the place was nearly empty. The website specifically says, service animals are allowed with proper documentation. As soon as I entered with my service animal the general manager, JOSH, ran up to me and my group and refused service. He told us that service animals are not allowed by the company. He was rude and uncooperative. We came in with our family of 10 with small children and we were asked to leave.

To be honest, it felt as though there were other things at play here, more than Josh's lack of knowledge regarding service animals and the law. This was one of the worst experiences and we will never come back again.",2019-07-28 19:45:36

After I read my order, she asked if there'd be anything else, I said it would be all, then she hung up on me. Hmm.. weird, I thought. So I go in to pick up my order, which (my fault) I didn't double check, and come home to find multiple items missing. I call back to make sure I wasn't charged, since I didn't receive an itemized receipt, and the same lady answers. ""Okay well I didn't hear you,"" she says after I explained the situation, and hangs up on me...AGAIN. Thankfully I wasn't charged. So, I figure, she had a bad night, whatever. 

So then last night, I decide to order takeout again. I recognize the woman's voice immediately, so I go ahead and place my order, once again she gives me the total, I say okay, she hangs up on me without reading back the order or telling me how long it'll be. So I call back asking how long it'll be, ""I don't know, 20 minutes?"" HANGS UP. At this point I'm wondering if I even go pick up the food, but I think to myself whatever, the Mac is good. So I go down to pick up my food, and a woman brings it out to me. Low and behold, it's the same woman that on the phone, AND she's the manager!

They have an entire wall of draft wines which is a very interesting concept, and though I am not a huge wine fan, I can see how people would be extremely enthused. The patio is gorgeous with a lot of plants and it feels as if it is in the heart of the city with the nearby buildings and bustling street. I highly recommend getting the fig and brie cheese flatbread, the 3 cheese gnocchi, or the crab deviled eggs as the appetizer.

Tony's has heavily dated decor and a cigar soiled smell that was completely unappetizing... Perhaps they should bottle up the smell and sell it to those trying to lose weight? 

The food was below average too, only further putting the kibosh on my appetite. I ordered the salmon with a double side of vegetables and a salad. The salad was 100% iceburg lettuce, which is fine because I love the crunch-factor... But I was so very disappointed with my entree, no crunchy iceburg could make up for it. The salmon was HORRIBLY COOKED and I could tell they simply took a pre-frozen piece of fish from an individually sealed package, threw it on a griddle and called it good to go. When it arrived in front of me, I was heavily disappointed to see a HUGE FISH COOKING FAUX-PAS.... The salmon albumin all over my plate! I would have also been disappointed by the tiny serving ($17.99 a plate) but I could certainly not stomach more than what was given to me. 

As for the other dishes, I heard nothing but NEGATIVE comments (one dining companion even imitated what Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares might say, it was hilarious but ANYTHING BUT complimentary), aside from the RAVIOLI apparently being fantastic, but if that's the only item that's good on this huge menu, it's definitely not worth trying out. 

The reason for the 2 star rating is because I came to this restaurant with a party of 15, half under the age of ten, and we only had ONE SERVER who never once got flustered or annoyed by our crazy commotion!

They had both in stock and the employee guided to me the cookbook section and helped me find the books. When I was checking out the employee was super sweet, made some small talk and even complimented my shirt.

I do prefer small bookstores usually, but Barnes & Noble was so convenient and the only other bookstore in the area didn't have what I wanted. I do appreciate how large the store is because it allows them to have a boatload of books it stock, but the downside is if you don't know the layout you almost have to go to customer service to be guided to what you want.

They had our table set up in a separate room with another group which was fine, plenty of room. The first mistake they made was allowing us to order direct from the menu. In our past experience at other restaurants, we have been given a limited menu which allows the kitchen a better opportunity to get everyone's food out in a timely manner. When we arrived our table was set up but had no menus on the table and no waters. Our waiter came over to take drink orders and everything seemed like it might start to be normal. He left with our drink orders and drinks slowly made their way to our table, still no waters or menus. Everyone immediately ordered a second drink because the first drink took so long. Finally, menus arrived...still no water and no one asked if we wanted water. I noticed that our waiter was basically by himself to handle our entire table. Again, at other restaurants, we are used to having 2 or 3 servers handle our large group. We ordered appetizers, again they slowly made their way to the table. We ordered our main courses. Entrees started to make their way to the table and it quickly became apparent that only half the table received their main course. The waiter came over and stated he messed up and lost half our orders, he took the orders a second time for those of us that did not receive any food. Again, these orders slowly made their way to the table and they were still missing 5 people. We sat down at 6pm it is now 8pm, two hours in a 5 people didn't have their food. The waiter and manager came over this time to ask once again what we were missing. 3 of the 5 ordered again, myself and one other guest decided not to re-order. I have worked in the food & beverage industry and have had many group gatherings at restaurants over the years and I have to say that Macaroni Grill was the least prepared to handle a group I have ever seen. When companies like ours plan these parties it is usually once a year and it is an important event to show our appreciation to our employees, to have it go so painfully wrong is not only upsetting but unacceptable for a restaurant like Macaroni Grill. One server assigned to our table, no menus on the table, no waters on the table, our guests having to go to the bar to get their own water and drinks, missing food orders, 2 hours into the party and guests still without food. This says to me very clearly that Macaroni Grill is improperly managed and they do not have a clue as to how to handle a group party. The manager ultimately took 25% off the bill and the waiter removed a couple of wines and coffee, none of which made the evening any less intolerable. As poorly as our group was handled they should be embarrassed that they charged us at all.",2018-12-10 19:56:01

CWXPtC2xuaCY-ZB5V1IJNA,CWAPMrQyiI38Jh7LuDUIIg,aPNXGTDkf-4bjhyMBQxqpQ,4.0,2,0,1,"So this is going to be one of those places that polarizes people. Especially in this part of town. Some people have to understand what it is Craft Hall is trying to accomplish. This is young family experience during the day, and large group gathering place by night. This type of venue is not always accepted in this zip code. But I'm telling you, this is not a tourist trap and is a genuine establishment. It is also surrounded by some very tough competition with restaurants and bars in Fishtown and NoLibs. I have a pretty high standard when it comes to food and drink and I'm going to say outright that I like everything that is the Craft Hall concept. There is one issue, and that's the pricing of food. Cutting to the chase, here's what to expect:

Before you even get inside, there's one seating area where you can bring a beer or food outside, sit along Delaware ave and hang out next to the chickens and rabbits in their coops (you can't pet them but you can watch them hop around). It's slightly removed from the rest of the establishment but it could be a nice thing to do with kids if the weather is nice. It's quiet and doesn't smell like a chicken coop at all. I love all animals, so I think this is cool.

The Space:
As you walk into the enormous space I notice that it's air-conditioned very well. This was a problem in the space when it used to be Yards brewing. It's an old building, which I believe to be one of the last remnants of the Jack Frost Sugar refinery (someone fact check me?), and it would get uncomfortable at times. But the temperature inside was nice even on a 90 degree day. This converted warehouse is split up between different seating areas. One section has a number of couches to kick back on. Another is filled with high-top tables and a traditional L-shape bar. Towards the back there are low-top tables, a ping pong table, cornhole and a shuffleboard table. In the furthest corner separated from rest of the room is the playground and kids area. Beyond that through a single door on the back wall, is more outside seating that borders but is fenced off from Delaware Ave. I'd like to note that the playground is very separate from the bar area. I wasn't tripping on children while drinking my beer. I was also surprised that the noise level is reasonably quiet and pleasant. Aside from a twenty-something jokingly playing the baby shark song on the communal piano behind me.

The Food and Drink:
So Craft Hall hosts the Mainstay Independent Brewing company started up by former brew masters of Slyfox and the late great Saint Benjamin's Brewing. I'm going to say that if you think their beer is bad, you are just simply wrong. These are some of the best German style beers I've ever tried from an American brewery. And I've tried A LOT. They brew primarily classic German styles. Don't get me wrong, these styles aren't always user-friendly, but they have a great assortment here that should fit anyone's tastes (both hop-lovers and hop-haters) if you learn about what you're ordering. You might just have to ask the bartender a few questions and sample some first. The King Laird Hefeweizen is one of my all-time favorites now and is definite crowd pleaser. The food seems to be New American and comfort foods with some BBQ sprinkled in. They use Lost Bread Company bread for everything, which speaks for itself. The food is excellent and the only reason this place did not receive 5 stars from me is because the food is very expensive for relatively smaller portions. For this reason, I come here all the time now, but for the beer and atmosphere. It's odd to me about the pricing of the food because the beer and cocktails are very reasonable. You can get pitchers of many of their beers for $18. To-go pounder 4 packs are $10. Growlers of their flagships are $13. Why are hush puppies $10 and a tiny asparagus salad $12? I get snacks like the bread board or the pretzels but I usually don't eat a meal here. I love the menu but the pricing is just a little off for an order-and-take-a-number kind of place.  

The Service:
Bartenders were very cool. I talked quite a bit with a few different bartenders and they were all friendly and all knew what they were talking about when it came to food and drink. Like I said before, this place is an order-at-the-counter and grab a number kind of place, so it was nice that they all took time to talk to me despite being busy. 

The Overall:
I really like this place. If they were to adjust their food pricing on some items, I think I would happily update to 5 stars here. I would like this place to succeed, so hopefully this review clears up some misconceptions of the place. Comfortable seating, great beer, fun games, cool bartenders, decent food. Bonus points for chickens. Built for the young family outing, group happy hours, Sunday fundays or a beer after a jog along Delaware Ave. Just understand what it is people come here for and you'll really like this place too.",2019-07-02 18:25:23

Overall, the fish was fresh and tasty, though I would have liked a little more flavor on some of the specialty rolls.

We started with: (1) Grandma's Wonton Soup (traditional fuzhou style pork wontons, scallions, celery), which was delightful--a very gentle broth and ghost-like wontons floating therein; (2) Pork Gyoza (kurobuta pork, scallions, ginger, pan-fried), which were nicely crisp, flavorful, and served piping hot; and (3) Wagyu Beef Spring Rolls (onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, mustard sauce), which included some delicious beef, however, the beef overwhelmed the rest of the spring roll.

We rolled on with: (a) Yellowtail & Chives house roll (avocado, chive oil), my favorite roll of the evening--that chive oil gave it a certain special something; (b) King Ghidorah specialty maki (spicy tuna, shishitos, hot sesame oil, topped with yellow-tail, jalapeño, tobiko), my second favorite roll; (c) Dynamite White Tuna house roll (spicy walu, crunch, shishitos), my third favorite roll; (d) Fishtown specialty maki (shrimp tempura, avocado, jalapeño, topped with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, spicy aioli), although this roll looked like it would have the most flavor, it didn't deliver on its looks, tasty, sure, but not my favorite; and (e) Eel Avocado classic maki.

I was a bit skeptical when I heard that it was wine on tap and thought that it would be like WINO, downtown. Cooper Vine is super chill and has a restaurant vibe to it, because it is a restaurant. I went for a work event and we had a private space upstairs. We ended doing a 4 wine flight where our servers brought unmarked bottles to the tables and we had to guess which wine we were consuming. 
Half glasses start off at $4-$5 and most bottles range from $36-$54 with wines from the east coast to the west coast and your usual South American, European , and South African wines. 
What I did not expect was to love the food. It was sooo good. We started off with french fries, deviled eggs and Brussels sprouts, which was absolutely divine. The Brussels are fried then baked and served with grated Parmesan. They were sooo good that you did not need the sauce that accompanied the sprouts. We also had a few different flatbreads which were all delicious! My favorite was the pulled pork flatbread with caramelized onions. 
The staff all seemed to really enjoy their job and were super helpful and friendly. My group definitely wanted to come back again for brunch, but rest assured the brunch menu will be available within the next couple of weeks and they will be available for brunch on both Saturdays and Sundays.

This is usually my goto place for late night eats since it is normally fast, cheap, and consistent. What I will say is during busy times it can take a while for your food to be made, so it may not be the fastest option all the time.

Recently, they reorganized the place so there is more room for people to stand when waiting for orders. This definitely opens up the space that can filled with over 3-4 dozen at a busy time.

Hard to excuse a poorly made sandwich at all, but when only three people are in the establishment during prime lunch time with a whopping three food orders, that's pretty bad.

We ordered wine and apps and got the apps before the wine. We were 100% done with all our appetizers before our server came back to take our main order. We tried to tell Dylan the red wine was un drinkable while he was taking our main orders and he said he would come around when it was our sides turn to order, but then practically ran away without giving us time to bring it up again. When we told him a second time and he seemed snarky. We all ended up ordering soup for our mains because we had such a long time after completing our apps we weren't really hungry anymore. Good for us (because we would have over ordered) bad for him (because his ppa went down and way less of a tip.) When our mains came two of us were splitting the poutine (cochon au lait debris fries) and while the plate was scorching the food inside was luke warm at best. We would have brought it up but he never asked if the food was good. He was MIA the rest of the meal (not that he was very present to begin with.) Or even friendly when he was present. Oh and eventually our other wine came but that took forever too. It was also very hard for us to get gross dirty plates taken away from the table. The French shallot(onion) soup had decent flavor but it was a tiny little dollop of cheese (not your normal smother in cheese and then baked French onion soup) floating on a Very chewy stale piece of bread that I couldn't cut at all.

That said, Tuna Bar is a tremendously hip new addition to the Philadelphia restaurant scene.

I actually ate there two nights in a row so that I could get a true taste of the cuisine.  The Wok Kampachi Ceviche was excellent but my favorite was the Scallop Crudo.  You should try Grandmom's Wonton Soup, which is a creative new rendition of the old time favorite that I highly recommend.  I even had my favorite roll, the Sindy roll, which I eat at the Maple Shade location. It was delicious as usual. 

Though Tuna Bar may borrow some rolls from the Yokohama menu, make no mistake, the food at Tuna Bar is original, upscale, and very creative.  The menu is evolving as it is perfected, and getting better by the day.",2017-12-03 19:59:47

On the other hand, if you stumble into the brand new Indianapolis location of the Texas-based chain of ""breastaurants"" called Twin Peaks hoping to enjoy some good eats, good drinks, and scenic views, then you'll likely be incredibly happy. 

Founded in 2005 in Lewisville, Texas, Twin Peaks opened for the dinner hour starting on 12/8/14 at the former Loon Lake Lodge just East of Castleton at the corner of I-69 and East 82nd Street. 

With its servers all wearing the trademark Twin Peaks cleavage and midriff-baring red plaid tops and khaki shorts, the concept behind Twin Peaks may sound familiar but this variation on the familiar theme is far less kitschy and far more personable than other similarly themed restaurants.

The easiest way to describe Twin Peaks is sports bar meets hunting lodge meets bevy of beautiful women. For those who remember Loon Lake Lodge and its abundance of hunting-themed decor, it makes sense that Twin Peaks choose this spot as its first Indianapolis location. The restaurant has multiple truly accessible parking spots and a set of rather light doors leading into the larger than you expect restaurant. As they just started serving dinners only on Monday of this week and open for regular business hours starting Saturday (12/13/14), the spirit in the restaurant was festive and friendly with multiple staff from the chain's Dallas area headquarters on location for training purposes. Thus, you get greeted at the door by enough beautiful women to make you dream for weeks. 

I worried a little as I arrived as the first bar area and first couple dining areas feature high-top tables/chairs that aren't wheelchair friendly. There's no reason to worry. Twin Peaks has multiple areas that are wheelchair friendly and I had no trouble navigating the restaurant (and was encouraged to do so). 

The menu consists of mostly American fare of a South, Southwest, and Heartland flavor with burgers, chicken, appetizers, a few other sandwiches, and a handful of meals. There's a large alcohol menu, of course, and a couple of desserts. There are two main bar areas, at least 3-4 larger dining areas, a small area known as the ""man cave,"" and there are wide-screen televisions throughout the restaurant and in the bathrooms!

I ordered a concoction known as the Smokehouse Burger with ""fire fries"" for $10.95 plus another couple bucks for my usual iced tea. I tend to be a rather simple burger guy and this particular burger was a bit out of my comfort zone. This may explain why I didn't find it completely satisfying. It tasted a tad underdone. It included cheddar cheese, red onion, BBQ sauce, bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The burger was easily my least favorite part of the experience, though I'd still put it in the 3-3.5 range. The fries were perfectly seasoned and stellar. The iced tea was also perfection and I did receive my usual refill. 

The highlight of the entire experience was Amanda, and not just because she was beautiful (though she was). She was attentive, personable, outgoing, and just seemed natural. She also scored points for sitting down to talk to me, not just because it's really hard to sit in a wheelchair and have a normal conversation with a skimpily clad young woman but because being at wheelchair height causes the neck to constantly have to stretch and it's nice when someone meets you eye-to-eye. Unlike that ""other"" chain that comes to mind, these young women all seemed comfortable with disability and Amanda, in particular, seemed natural and at ease (NOTE: I did learn she has a brother who is deaf. I'm sure that helps). 

While it was a little slow during the 5pm hour in which I arrived at Twin Peaks, I was impressed with Amanda's personable nature and ability to talk about work, disability, sports, food and, yes, even what it's like to work in a place with an outfit that would make most of us blush. It was refreshingly awesome and, to be honest, not what I expected when I entered the doors. 

The service was stellar. The food was good, though I'll likely stick to my comfort zone next time. The decor was warm, inviting, and wheelchair friendly. The views, as their slogan notes, definitely scenic. While I do lean toward the shy side, I think it's human nature to appreciate a little extra attention and, as Twin Peaks notes on its website, the Twin Peaks girls offer an abundance of ""girl next door"" charisma and playful personalities. 

What can I say? Welcome to Indianapolis, Twin Peaks!  For more information on Twin Peaks, visit their website at http://twinpeaksrestaurant.com",2014-12-12 01:45:47

So I agree with some of the other reviews, it is VERY hard to find amazing sushi in Philadelphia. It's just difficult to come by, while this sushi was not the best I have ever had, the experience was five stars. 

First, I love the ambience. This is a place that suits many occasions, first dates, get together with friends, lunch with a coworker, etc. I would say definitely more of an intimate setting, I came here with Megan F. for a lunch during a work break! Such great vibes. Love the bar area and full length windows, just adds to the ambience! 

We tried their steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and for rolls we split the J&J roll, peppered tuna roll, and the east roll. The east roll is just your standard salmon sushi roll, nothing too crazy.  The J&J is a great roll for people trying to transition into the sushi eating world of actual raw fish! Loved the seared tuna on the outside. Hands down, our favorite was the peppered tuna roll! I'm a spicy tuna roll enthusiast and I decided to switch it up with this roll. I have zero regrets, a definite must try and great chance of tuna palette.


Overall the place and the sushi varieties are very modern, definitely worth a try if you're near this area of philly!",2018-04-02 18:25:32

We got lost finding the entrance so we called inside. The host gave great directions and even said ""are you in the black jacket? I see you!"" So sweet!

We had a reservation and got seated right away. The indoor is absolutely beautiful! 

I started off with a cocktail (could not remember which one) and we split the tuna tartare. We also got the pork gyoza to split. Both were AMAZING and we tore through them in probably minutes. 

I ordered a wonton soup as a starter. By the time our entrees came it had not, so I asked about it. He said they were out of wonton soup (weird) but it was also 10 pm, so it was fine! 

For our main course, my roommate got shrimp tempura and I got the fish town roll. I was not expecting that much heat, so be careful!! I ended up taking the jalapeños off but it was still delicious! 

After that, I had consumed quite a few drinks, and was getting drunk hungry. I last minutes ordered the fried rice with the egg on top. Amazing!!! Satisfied every craving! I even left with some to go (that I finished before I went to bed )

I called to reserve an outdoor table for 4 and was told they would be able to fulfill my request. Fast forward to the next day...I arrived and lo and behold there wasn't an outdoor table available. I didn't want to inconvenience the others in my party, so we agreed to sit inside. At first, there appeared to be adequate social distancing. BUT no one inside was wearing a mask or required to wear one while not eating. About 30 minutes later, the place was well over 100% capacity. There were way too many people in there and no one was masked, except me and another at my table. Most of the staff had on masks, except one guy who stood by our table for a loooooong time talking to another employee. I was really uncomfortable. 

Now on to the food. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was big! The pork was delicious but the ham could have been better in my opinion. Overall, I'd give the sandwich a 3.5. I upgraded my fries to the truffle fries. They were good but I feel I only got enough to go with one half of my sandwich. My friend had the ancient grain and sugarcane salad, add oysters. It looked delicious and she said it was!

We decided to pay using the QR code on the receipt. After submitting payment, we realized we didn't have the option to tip.

He asked me what my problem areas are and said the Groupon offer is just to get people in the door. He said normally you'll need about 16 sessions to see results. He said it costs $1200 but he could break it down into monthly payments. I pad 405.60 that day on top of the $110 I paid via Groupon. I was spectacle but Adam Wilkes guaranteed me that it's best to do 16 sessions.  I scheduled my first appointment the following week. When I came in for my appointment no one was at the receptionist desk. I went to Adam Wilkes office and he said do you have an appointment. I told him you scheduled my appointment last week. He quickly claimed he remembered and brought me into a room. Turned on Alexia and told me to lay down on the table. He started placing these plastic pads on me and put glasses on me and said I'll be back. No one came back . I was in the room for about 35 min. The procedure was suppose to take 20 min. After waiting for 15 I removed the pads myself.. When I came out of the room Allyson said did you take the pads off yourself? Yes Adam didn't come back for me.

Here was a variety of knick knacks, wall hangings, and seasonal items to add a bit of style or flair to your home.  The aisles were clear, but I did need to say ""excuse me"" to get around clusters of shoppers who tend to forget anyone else is browsing.

The other side of the place (even larger) is the Antique Mall.  This was a little less organized, but manageable.  Here were more collectibles and antiques than I saw on the other side.  Some of the stuff made me scratch my head why it was there (an empty Sun King can for $3?), but other items looked like the type of stuff you could pick up for your collections.  Lots of dishware, books and music sources, and quite a bit of nostalgia items that I remember (mid 20th century items), but not in the best of condition were noticed.

Plan to allow yourself plenty of time to browse since just the walking will take you awhile even without stopping to snoop.

M6eQkVK58LSkWeMBR1W4Uw,bXkEIMc8FFab-M_JVx5QpA,YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,2.0,1,0,0,"I reserved a table for a Saturday night dinner for a bachelorette group. When I made the reservation I asked about vegan options because I didn't see anything on the menu. The person who took the reservation assured me there were vegan menu items so I assumed the menu online was outdated or didn't have all items listed.

When we arrived at the restaurant, I was disappointed that our vaccine cards weren't checked- there was no request for anything like that. We waited for a few minutes in a lounge area near the bathroom before being seated, and were seated pretty quickly after that. We placed drink orders and then a lot of time went by while we waited to order appetizers. I eventually had to get up to ask someone if we could place an appetizer order. 

When ordering dinner, I asked about the vegan options. The only menu item that is vegan as-is was a bowl of olives. Our server said there were no vegan options. I asked her if she could check with the kitchen because the person that took the reservation was very reassuring about vegan items. She came back and said they could do a vegetable plate with ""what we have in house."" When I asked, she said it was carrots and green beans. I asked if there were possibly grains or beans in addition to the veggies? Nope. Just two veggies apparently. I let her know how disappointed I was she was defensive and not apologetic or kind about it at all. I would have expected more from a restaurant that has a chef in-house, especially when it was not busy in the restaurant, and because I had called ahead. 

I ended up getting a salad without bacon and cheese (of course it is the same price without those ingredients - hello vegan tax!) and having some fries left over from our appetizers. It reminded me of the early 2000s when fries and a side salad were the only meat-free items I could order at most restaurants. 

The best part of my meal (aside from spending time with my friends!) was two wonderful glasses of wine. The food and especially the service was so underwhelming. I have previously really enjoyed sitting outside on the patio with my wine, but I just don't think I'll be back after this.",2021-11-11 21:24:27

Fine.  No big deal.  Honestly, I think the Target employees probably resolved it as quickly as they could - three managers and one security person were all involved in the process.

I've been here three times, and I've grown to like it more and more with each visit.

The wine options are very solid. I appreciate the fact that they are not so numerous as to be overbearing: I typically don't like being presented with a long list of wines that doesn't seem particularly curated. For each wine type, they have 1-3 options at different price points. Another great selling point is that you can try each wine in different sizes; in other words, you don't have to fully commit to any one wine if you want to be more experimental.

The food offerings are delicious. I've gotten a few flatbreads and have never been disappointed. The duck fat fries are mouthwatering. For entrées, I've only gotten the bouillabaisse, but it exceeded my expectations.

They have a unique selection of wines on tap, the snacks are good, and it's a great atmosphere for drinks with friends or a date. I especially love sitting in the outdoor courtyard area, which is great for a warm spring afternoon. I've tried a variety of their small plates and really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts (obviously) and the flat breads. Copper Vine is a great spot to grab drinks and snacks after work for people who work in the CBD or before a show at the super dome/ smoothie king center. I highly recommend making a reservation if you are trying to get a table before a popular concert because it gets very packed.

5/5 STARS!

Food: First and foremost, their food is amazing. I have been to many sushi spots in the greater city and Philadelphia area but Tuna Bar's sushi has the best overall quality and taste. Their speciality rolls are to die for. My personal favorites are the Sindy Roll, Rittenhouse Roll, and Hurts Roll. As for favorite appetizers, it is definitely the tuna flatbread and their oysters. Yum. 
 
Drinks and Cocktails: The best part about going to an amazing restaurant for food is having an amazing alcohol and drink selection to complement the meal. Personal favorite cocktails are the yuzu sour and the race street. If you're a sake fan then definitely ask them about their wide variety of sake. Cheers! 

Ambience: The ambience and the atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing. The ""vibes"" are great. They are always playing great music that sets a positive mood for everyone. Big ups to whomever created that playlist! 

Service: Last but certainly not the least, their service. Simply wow. Tuna bar has the best service. I have to give Ken, the owner, a thumbs up for creating such an amazing establishment with an amazing team. Their General Manager, Tina, was phenomenal. Her professionalism, positive attitude, and seasoned experience can be seen from a mile away. I remember on a busy Saturday night, she was juggling 5 things at once, but still managed to provide my family and I an amazing time. She was super friendly! The rest of the staff were A+ too! 

Would I go again? YES YES YES. 

Recommend to a friend? FOR SURE.

If you are vegan, skip the egg (sub Avo) & skip the feta.  Would recommend they offer some non dairy cheese option here..non dairy feta is wonderful.  
As usual, fantastic lattes with oat milk! 
Great service...many familiar faces.  Thank you Sierra!
They do offer some gluten free sweets like a gluten free brownie (but do not think it is vegan...).  Really encouraging places to offer some gluten free vegan options when they can. 
The breads are amazing.  If you are not strict gluten free, their sourdough is a good option given how sourdough is made. And it is one of the few times, I will skip my usual gluten free needs and dive into their breads.  The sandwiches made on their breads take the idea of a ""sandwich"" and bring it to the next level.  So good.  
Still a local favorite spot mixed with some interesting visitors that have now discovered this treat!

oh by the way if there is a line, it moves fast (usually).

Tip: Order Online for Take Out in advance.  Then stroll to the beach for a nice walk.  Take the route along State street to enjoy some nice window shopping OR go the side street past Lucky Penny & Shopkeepers (great store), then to the beach..just a few blocks away.

As more readers grab books online, the need for giant bookstores might become a convenience rather than a primary source.  

So this chain has added lots of departments that aren't too far of a stretch from reading to appeal to customers and continue to bring them in.  Besides thousands of books, there was an artists supplies area, a video area, a toys and games area, periodicals, young readers, and a cafe!  Throw in convenient parking (free) out front and you could spend a lot of free time browsing the store, finding something of interest, and then grabbing something in the cafe so you don't have to wait to start reading!

Well kept and plenty of staff even on a Monday evening to assist customers find what they wanted.

We hadn't been there in a year and it has definitely gone downhill. Last Sunday I decided to order the dish pictured (the mushroom ravioli) via Doordash. Ordering went fin, but when it arrived, it seemed a little light for a dish that might resemble the dish featured on their menu, especially one costing $21. I opened it up and I saw this monstrosity. Only a few pieces of ravioli, burnt to the point of being inedible with a dash of (also burnt) mushroom gravy. I immediately called up the restaurant and demanded an explanation. I was told that the General Manager cooked this particular dish and that I would be getting a refund in a week. 
Well, it's been a week. I called and was told it might be another couple of weeks before I get my refund because the folks in the corporate office are only occasionally in the main office anymore. I did get an offer for them to remake my order. No thanks. Fool me once . . . 
I will never be eating here again and I don't recommend anyone else do until they either hire new management or, at least, banish the GM from the kitchen. They clearly don't know how to cook or about appropriate portions

Second try and this place just doesn't do it for me so it's story time.  Cause I'm in quarantine so this review is going to be a long one. 

Spark notes: Expensive bad food. 

I remember when they opened. So happy to see the skeezy place before it replaced.  Like a basic bitch I oooed at the thought of cocktails in the beautiful outdoor courtyard. 

If you're not with your gal pals, you're on a date.  That's just the type of place this is.  Like I said the courtyard is insta worthy and if you didn't happen to notice, the building preserved its historic charm.  Stand on poydras and admire those beams... 

Unfortunately, that's where my love ends.  The first experience, a date, was disappointing to say the least.  Not the date, the food. Which is worse. Bad date I can handle, bad food? No ma'am. 

You're in a beautiful courtyard what do you order? Charcuterie of course.  Let's feel like we're under the Tuscan sun surrounded by grape leaves... 

Back to reality, you're in New Orleans and this meat and cheese plate is nothing like Italy.  Forget fresh prosciutto or cheese from a sheep.  They can't even serve bread that's not stale.  Before you hiss at me, yes crostini is toasted.  I know the difference. My date and I agreed, this hard bread just wasn't going to do.  After waiting longer than I'd like for food that doesn't require cooking, we got more bread but there was no difference.  I'm sure we ate some other stuff but it wasn't memorable.

After first experience left me unimpressed, we never went back.  We would drive by and comment about our bad memory. Expensive bad food. 

Fast forward to Quarantine 2020.  I'm surfing IG because that's honestly all I do now. Some places are starting to offer family meals. We eat out often so more food for less money sounds like a good plan.  

20% off food at copper vine, let's give it another try. I called to place an order and the person answering the phone was not aware of family meals and when I asked about todays was told it's pork chops not pulled pork? Unfortunately I ordered from some where else.  This place upset me again. 

Is there a character limit on these reviews??? If you're still reading you must be in quarantine still. 

So I decide to say something about it. Cause I've never been one to keep my mouth shut.  Sent them a DM on IG.  Fast response. So sorry for the confusion. How about a free meal? Sweet! Yes please.  Never asked my name...Swing by to pick up my meal prepared for the worst.  Manager must have been expecting me.  Although my order was for a specific pick up time, I might as well have ordered when I got there. Ended up waiting 20mins and there were zero other people waiting. 

Time to eat. Fried Fish, Mac, green beans, bread pudding.  Edible. Certainly not worth normal price tag. Bread pudding was beyond dry.  This is where their stale bread could come in handy yet they somehow made it more dry... drench that shit in whiskey sauce and eat my free meal.  

The strong will (hopefully) survive this quarantine.  I'd be shocked if it's copper vine.",2020-04-17 19:07:08
T_BTgW4WzfsqhBxLPjiQeQ,qWYEuBZP7av55tewg3PXKg,tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg,5.0,10,8,12,"$129.77 later without tax or tip and 12,977% worth the money spent. Yes, baby, yes! Can I get an hallelujah?! I am screaming at the top of my lungs for The Green Pheasant. Alas, I have found my date night spot. Now, if only I had a date to take with me!

That was pretty exciting first paragraph, wasn't it? The breakdown is pretty clear. When you arrive, valet the car with the restaurant. Just do it and quit groaning at the suggestion. This will make your life a whole lot easier for a stress-free starter to your date. Go to the hostess desk where they will seat you for your reservation that you made 2 weeks ago. As they take you to your table, observe the ambiance. Will they take you to the upstairs with the quirky bathrooms? Will they take you to the main dining room where there is a central bar to people watch or are they going to take you to your private dining room with the awesome wallpaper of CCTV cameras and roses? Yes, you read that right. If you are able, take some photos in there because the wallpaper is totally worth a photo of. Most of the restaurant should find itself in a covershoot in Nashville Scene. Who doesn't love green and red velvet everywhere!?

Now that you're seated, take it all in. Check out the menu and inhale all of the quirky offerings on the menu. But before ordering food, get your sake order in and prepare for a toast! You can get that unique cocktail you were eyeing in the next round. This round is about sharing the moment you realized you're about to have one of the best damn dining experiences in Nashville. Kanpai! ('Cheers' in Japanese)

You've looked over the menu and you're going to order 4-5 items between you and your dining companion. They offer everything from vegetarian to what I'd consider a very large unsightly fish on a plate ready for consumption. I don't like whole fish, but the table next to us certainly did! Whatever you palette wishes is Green Pheasant's command.

The experience exceeds just the dining portion. Let's talk service. Carlos was exceptional. Beyond words, topnotch, never missed a beat, glowing service. He was hospitable, prompt, and very nurturing to our table. He never hoovered and we never had to ask for anything. He was like a genie who appeared when I had a fleeting thought of needing a beverage or another glass of water. We also appreciated his knowledge of the cuisine and his mindfulness of our spice-level tolerance. We ordered based on his recommendations and we loved every last thing he suggested.

After 2.5 hours of eating and drinking, it is time to go. Time to wrap up and get going. But, you do not exit without leaving a gigantic tip for the awesome server you just had, and you do not omit grabbing a couple of photos of yourself with your dining partner to capture the experience that will be ingrained in your culinary memory for a life time. Bask in the moment while you can. You'll return soon, but in the meantime, enjoy the moment at this moment.

Have fun? I know I did. Check it out and do it soon!",2019-01-22 14:51:28

When me and my wife got to New Orleans Friday morning all of the cars were sold out around town. My sister located Nifty's which is near the airport. She got in touch and they stated that they have one car a two door Fiat. I was not too happy about the choice of car but my wife said we will take it.  It was a small yellow two door car but it got us to Jackson State's Homecoming with no issues.  The car was good on gas and we were able to fit into tight spaces for parking at JSU's Homecoming.  I can't thank Niftys enough for allowing me to attend my Alma Mater's homecoming and my wife's first time attending JSU's Homecoming which she truly enjoyed. Thank you Niftys.,2019-11-23 19:47:38

I'm not a beer person, so my reviews of breweries are more about the experience than the actual beer. If you're a beer snob, this review may not help you, however, for my occasional beer drinkers out there, I'll be speaking your language.

This brewery has won awards for their beer and they are proud of them. They are displayed around the room, which makes for cool décor. They have a table in the front with all the Big 10 schools' logos carved in individual tree trunks. I always love seeing the Big M - Go Blue!

They had one porter on tap, so I was solid. The options are limited, but what they do, they do well. My total without tip was $5.45. I don't think I'll ever get over the cheapness of beer in Indy. 

They have a ton of seating both inside and outside. We opted to sit outside and stumbled upon the 5280 Bistro Food Truck. It's a neat partnership to have the food truck outside. If you have a chance to eat at it, you should! I love breweries that have food truck partnerships!",2017-07-05 11:44:08

We gave this place one more go after a couple inconsistencies throughout 8 or 9 orders (missing ingredients a few times, wait times for to go always seemed like our food had been sitting way too long - plus usually nobody out front, they all hang out in the kitchen)...honestly when the food was good, it was really really good, ya know? 

Too bad we chanced it again and had the same issues today, thankfully we caught it at the car and went back inside to recover 2 missing ingredients. They took care of the quinoa for my boyfriend's salad but said the avocados they had weren't ripe enough yet, and both entrees listed avocado. Somehow this wasn't noted by anyone or relayed to us while ordering. My boyfriend asked for some sort of compensation for that and the instances before - not a full refund, just to help with the repetitive inconveniences. Note that we never asked for a full refund, at any point...

Somehow the manager could not comprehend this. He offered to take back the food and then grabbed the bag from me, and I snatched it back because we had already paid and he refused to hear us out. I simply didn't want to return my food after being told a 25 minute wait time that seemed horribly inaccurate given the sparse state of the restaurant. 

What resulted was a bit of chaos and confusion. Everyone got more frustrated trying to get to the source of the problem then he began mocking us as I explained our experiences in the past, quoting my words back and laughing. He couldn't understand why we would come back if we had noticed anything wrong to begin with. The reason was me giving them the benefit of the doubt because anyone who's worked in restaurants knows that it can be variable and stressful... Joke's on us though as proven by his incredulous laughter, followed by ""I'll just get you the full refund. I know what kind of people you are and what you want."" 

At that point I felt we're dealing with a personal bias more than anything else. He would rather pay $30 back to us to be rude and unapologetic, rather than admit any fault or discuss the matter logically. Also, when someone says ""I've been in the restaurant business for years"" as a defense tactic when I ask why I'm being laughed at... it doesn't give them credibility. It feels like pulling at straws because they don't know the right way to handle a lack of communication from their employees. Terribly unprofessional, and a horrible experience, but maybe that's why they're in a place with guaranteed business from the sports rather than trying to make it on their own.",2019-07-18 22:52:10

I've been out of town and my car is parked in my driveway so it was no big deal.  I did a lot of research while searching every corner of my house and chose am & pm, even tho I got a good quote from another locksmith because of the great reviews on yelp.   I figured I may run the risk of paying a bit more I figured you cant put a price on great service.  I called at 930 this morning from a friends phone, my iphone is on the fritz again and I need my car to get to my apple store. Now I need my car,geez!!  (One heck of a morning)  So I'm stressed enough.  This was my first impression and experience when I called................

(phone ringing)
(sleepy sounding person(didn't identify themselves):  hello
me:  um, Good Morning is this am & pm locksmith??

(sounding like I bothered their sleep): yea
me: ok well I lost my car key and wanted to speak to someone about coming out and helping me out

(sleepy person): what your numer?
me: um........ I'm having some issues with my phone right now so I'm not sure what my number is, the number that came up on your caller ID is the number you can reach me at

(sleepy person): well I can't start without a number
me:  oh........ well I'm gonna have to call u back then with the number.  I don't know it off the top of my head.

I paused and was going to ask if I could just get a price quote but the person hung up.  

My thing is honestly I don't give my number out unless I'm going to go with  the service.  I wanted a quote and a good customer service experience. perhaps a ""good morning"" or a little understanding??   I hung up and called my original locksmith choice. I'm stressed enough I don't need to feel as tho my issue doesn't need to be addressed.  Lot of choices of locksmiths and they should work on their employees who pick up the phone.  Perhaps identifying the business that is being called or identifying yourself.  Lots of people are unemployed myself included and would love to work in a place where they can help people who are stuck between a rock and a hard place.

I love seafood and because I am a foodie, when I think seafood, I think wine...the perfect pairing of a crisp white...any white..any red...I have never seen such a horrid wine list.  If a beer and shot and fru-fru umbrella drink is your thing, great.  Docs is your place.  If you love to wash down your oysters with something that does not make you wretch...consider-you have no options.  The wine list is, well, insulting.
I admit, my frustration comes with emailing the restaurant today and them telling me they had a great NZ Sauvignon Blanc by the bottle.  We arrive and are told they have been out of that wine FOR DAYS.  
Our waitress, though adorable, was spotty and did not get our orders correct.
  The food?  Solid.  The ambiance? Great.  The wine and ""touches"" of extra?  Nope.  I don't think I will be back...unless I am drinking bourbon on the rocks and sitting at the bar.  Everyone has their thing.  A nice glass of wine to go with great food is mine.",2011-07-27 01:28:55

I came here on a Sunday morning at around 10:30 and it was PACKED - line was well out the door. I live within walking distance so I turned right back around to go home and placed an online order for pickup ~45 min later. 

We got the elvis style banana bread, wildflower honey ricotta on sourdough toast, and the green eggs and ham on a biscuit. I was most pleasantly surprised by the elvis because it's not something I would have normally ordered but the flavors complemented each other so well and the banana bread itself was great. It was a huge chunk of bread so it was also a more filling dish than I expected. We both loved the ricotta toast, which was light and more dessert like. The sourdough bread was very impressive - very soft on the inside with lots of crunch on the outside. Lastly, the green eggs and ham was great with the green harissa sauce and there was a huge piece of fluffy egg. It's not a sauce I've had before on a breakfast sandwich and I was a fan! Sadly it did not come with a biscuit like the online website says, but brioche instead.

I called ahead for a reservation but they were booked up for most of the night.   I was told we could sit at the bar and it would be best to come early.   We actually arrived before their dinner hours began, so we sat at the bar and ordered from their small plates.  

Mike was very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  He concocted a great non-alcoholic drink for me, which I ordered a few of over the course of our meal!   I can't remember exactly what it was, I believe it was made of cranberry juice, soda water, and a generous sprig of rosemary (picture attached).

We started with the edamame, yaki gyoza (pheasant dumplings), tuna tartare, and lobster shumai (lobster and corn dumplings).  Everything was nicely plated and tasted wonderful.

Next up were the famed spicy crab noodles.  Upon arrival of this dish, we quickly realized: a) that it was so good that we had to order another, b) that it was so good that my spouse was going to eat it all so we had to order another, and c) that it was so good that I wasn't going to want to share the dish with my spouse, so we had to order another!  So, we immediately ordered another!   

Also--interesting find--the toilet seats were heated!

1. $4 parking (0-60min)- No validation
2. Dining area had too much furniture and was not clean.
3. The shelves with drinks, chips, etc. looked like they were having a close out sale. Empty.
4. Rude employees...
5. Trash cans were overflowing and they didn't even have openings big enough to accommodate the containers the food was served in.
6. If one of your family members order a salad, and the other a sandwich, you can't pay for them together. It's weird.

The food was decent once we got it but honestly, not all that great considering the hassle you have to go through to get it and eat. There are a million great places to eat in Nashville...I'd put this low on the list.",2019-08-19 19:05:21

Top it off with argumentative staff! I offered to pay the full $700 + tax and install on my own; they make $150 and no headaches. Jerry got a uptight saying ""we're not in business to make $150""! I said ""how about zero dollars"" and am shopping elsewhere....

The space is sleek, cool and comfortable. The nonstop ""house"" music was a bit much, and made it somewhat hard to hear dinner conversation, but we understood the vibe that they were shooting for and took it all in stride. The menu is a fantastic mix of classic Japanese izakaya dishes with some larger plates that are great for sharing. I'm not a big fan of menus that list the name of the dish followed by all of the ingredients without an actual description of the preparation, but our server was very familiar with the menu and talked us through everything. We had two of their craft cocktails; they were spot on perfect. Each was a great mix of sweet, sour, bitter and refreshing. 
We ordered Dan Dan Shishito peppers; very reminiscent of Dan Dan Mian,  without the heaviness of the noodles. A great started. That was followed by lobster and spot prawn shu mai; unlike many restaurant dishes that claim to feature lobster, the succulent crustacean was very present in this one. Then a riff on okonomiyaki; a hash brown pancake with traditional okonomiyaki toppings and sauces. It was like an asian latke; perfect for this time of year. We finished with the whole trout, fried and served with thinly sliced cucumbers, asian slaw and steamed buns. The trout was cooked perfectly; it was silky and juicy. One thing to note; for a restaurant that features a sharing menu, a puzzling number of items came out in odd numbers. 5 shu mai, three steamed buns with the trout; Management-how about 6 shu mai and 4 steamed buns so a pair of enthusiastic and hungry diners don't have to fight over the ""odd bun out""?

They haven't even bothered to claim their Yelp page, so, we know how much they care about their inevitably terrible reviews here. Annual fees for my card are going up. Ok. Fine. It happens. Not fine when agents don't have the correct information about it and take no responsibility. 

Read about the hike in the news before Chase provides with any information. Thanks, Cahse. Everything says April 1st. My card was opened in March but the fee charged April 1st, and it's unclear to me if it will renew at the old or new rate. Called and spoke with a rep who told me I'll renew at $450 since my renewal is on the 1st. Awesome! I make some irreversible travel decisions based on that information. 

Fast forward to when Chase FINALLY emails something official to me, and suddenly it says ""on or after"" April 1st. I send an email just to double check and get something in writing. Low and behold, a woman who sounds like a robot over email tells me my new fee is $550 with no accountability or apology or attempt to make things right. I asked for an escalation but literally just got the same email copy pasted by the same person with this at the top ""Let me share that your email has reached the highest level of escalation. I apologize for the inconvenience caused.""  Sort of insulting, no? When asked about the escalation process ""Your concern was reviewed and addressed by our Escalations team. For privacy reasons, we generally don't discuss specific business interactions."" Cool. What if I hadn't emailed them to double check in writing? I'm pretty sure I would have been charged the high fee and had z e r o recourse - they would have essentially stolen $100 from me. Not ok. 

Additionally, their own twitter response team has been publicly posting ""If your account anniversary is date is before April 1, 2020, then you will still be charged the same old annual fee"". Anyone reading this would rightfully assume if the card was opened in March, the old fee would apply. However, I'm being told ""The anniversary date is the statement date of the first bill you received."" Sneaky. 

Totally unacceptable. Zero empathy, accountability, communication skills. Over it.",2020-01-18 18:41:06

I like the very laid back and relaxed atmosphere here. The inside of the place is decorated like a tropical beach house with a straw roof bar area, surf boards, and painted fish and palm tree murals. Background music with rock music and Buffett tunes resonates throughout the place. There are colorful wooden patio chairs and there's outside seating with flaming lamps and a spectacular view of the traffic out on Pottstown Pike and the Kmart across the road. 

I sat up at the bar so I could watch the sports highlights on the TV. There are several beers on tap including Landshark, Miller Lite, Coors Light, Sam Adams, and Yuengling Lager. On Monday nights, it's Raingutter Regatta when there are drink specials on Landshark Lager. Since I still had a long drive left, I went nonalcohic and ordered a very fruity pomegranate soda. I went over the menu which offers beach fare including appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, bbq ribs, coconut shrimp, fish tacos, and desserts. Turkey and veggie burger options available at no additional cost.

I did not order a cheeseburger, but I went for the Fish Tacos ($10.99), 3 of them served with island rice. The fish tacos were stuffed grilled flour tortillas (soft and crispy) with spicy grilled fish, cabbage, and pineapple salsa, served with a tangy orange dressing on the side. The rice was lacking flavors, but otherwise a healthier accompaniment than fries. The service at the bar was laid back. My order was taken, the food brought out in acceptable time, and I was left alone to enjoy the food and the fruity soda. I skipped over dessert and I left pretty satisfied with the meal, still not quite the same as So Cal fish tacos, but decent.",2009-04-27 23:38:37

She showed us color swatches so we'd know what the other colors looked like. We then had to decide which bed we wanted so we left.

The ice cream itself had a very rich chocolate flavor without being too sweet and the cone added a nice balance. The only issue I had was that the ice cream started to melt kind of fast. I already had some drippage by the time I sat down at the table.

XkL8GyAsIB6nuq9O-Fpi9Q,fbO2EDVPgRk5UQ8NE7QVHw,seKihQKpGGnCeLuELRQPSQ,2.0,3,3,2,"After driving by Twin Peaks daily for months, we decided to finally pop in to see what all the fuss was about.  We had noticed that the parking lot was PACKED the first few months it was open and initial Yelp reviews were touting Indy's newest breast-aurant as the place to be.  Also, we were curious to see how the cool old Loon Lake Lodge had been transformed in to the new space.

We visited at about 6:30 on a balmy 89 degree Sunday night and were seated on the large wrap-around patio at a huge, tall, heavy wooden table.  There are TVs EVERYWHERE -- hanging back to back over each of our heads, 4 on the wall beside us -- just EVERYWHERE.  The tables on the patio are massive and easily sit 6, and some inside (inside it is HUGE!) looked to seat 10+ or more -- with several smaller parties divided up by a slider depicting an ax through the table.  There was a fire pit at the corner of the patio as well.  

Our scantily clad yet overdressed for the weather (more on this later) little teeny-tiny server was completely friendly, but lacked menu knowledge aside from ""these 2 sandwiches have an egg on them and if you like fish we have trout and fish tacos"".  We later learned that sweet ""Bambi"" had just been in training last week, so we cut her some slack.  

Beer options were surprisingly super limited (no local or craft beers offered), but I decided to give the Dirty Blonde house brew a try -- reminded me of Blue Moon -- served in a big ol' super frosty mug at 29 degrees. I must say it is really tasty with an orange wedge!  

We got the hand braided pretzel ($5) for an app -- served with warm beer cheese (made with the house beer Knotty Brunette) and grainy brown mustard.  Decent.  Greasy(?) but decent.

The food menu is not diverse, folks.  Healthy food eaters beware -- aside from 2 'loaded' salads (a cobb and one other), there were zero real options for a health nut.  Even the broccoli was listed as ""sauteed"" on the menu.  

I threw caution to the wind and for dinner I picked the fish tacos and subbed out the chips and salsa for the mac and cheese (topped with bacon).  The hubs got the Smokehouse Burger and fire fries.  While my fish had a good season on it, there just wasn't a whole lot of it, but there WAS a ton of the cabbage slaw on top.  The mac and cheese was just ok.  Hub's burger came with 2 patties even though he specified just one patty (it is an option for a few bucks less), so he took one patty off.  The patties appeared a little Mc-pre-formed and flat-top cooked -- not grilled.  Disappointing.  The fries were just regular thick cut frozen steak fries with some ""cajun"" seasoning on them.  Meh.    

Food aside, I do have 2 general gripes to share.  Uh oh... 
-- I feel that I need to advocate for the servers here when it comes to their uniform -- and no, not in the feminist ""women are being objectified at Twin Peaks"" kind of way.  What I mean is this -- it was almost 90 friggin degrees outside and you have these gals in thick knee socks and black Ugg boots?  Sure, the top 1/2 of their body gets plenty of ventilation, but seriously?  That footwear and sock combo? And as a former server I know that non-slip shoes in the kitchen were a must... what happened here, folks??  And is Ugg material even sanitary with food rehash and kitchen gunk on them?  Sorry -- just had to be said.

-- My biggest gripe of the whole deal is that they allow smoking on the covered patio while people dine and it is mere feet from the doors in to the restaurant.  There was a dirty ash tray on our table when we sat down and patrons from inside were stepping ""out"" around our table to smoke while we were trying to stomach a meal.  YUCK.  We even had to ask the young men at the table next to us to kindly turn off the fan mounted above their table as it was blowing their smoke directly at us.  UGH. This seriously put a damper on our meal and overall experience.

All in all, I would give our TP experience a one and a half star rating based on the pricey meh-esque food and the aforementioned gripe alone, but the beer was good and our server was really sweet.  I just don't see us rushing back to Twin Peaks for another $50 meal any time soon.  Perhaps to watch a game and have a beer, but not for the lackluster food.",2015-06-09 16:37:39

As an alum of the building across the street, I was perplexed at how such a massive building with so many parts would fit *right there*. Like, how would that work? As a result, I gave it some space for a while. Not that it did anything wrong. I just didn't understand the physics behind the construction. And then I ventured inside...

I don't know how they did it... I don't know what kind of witchcraft was involved but the powers that be managed to create a space that's light, airy and much more massive than I would imagine from the outside. This isn't Caviar & Bananas' first time at the rodeo -- and it shows. This is the perfect Midtown breakfast/lunch spot. With dedicated areas that fit whatever mood you're in, you're sure to find something to suit your needs. Want a gluten-free muffin? Do it. Need some frozen rose in your life? All the time! I mean, you can find that here. Feel like some bougie grocery shopping? Okay. Looking for some international candies? They have 'em. In the mood for a sandwich? They can do that.* Fancy a salad? Let's do that... and that's what I did. A very smiley and kind young woman walked me through the menu. She told me her favorite was the Baja, so I ordered that. I was planning on eating my salad there but she prepared it in a to go box. I don't know if that's standard (a set up like C&B seems that it should go hand in hand with cool plateware) but it happened. With the to go box in hand, I took the salad to go and made my way home.

The salad was delicious. The combo of romaine, cotija cheese, avocado, corn, tomato, cucumber, jicama, pickled onions, and pumpkin seeds was a nice, bright burst of health with every bite. I haven't had much jicama since leaving Miami so that was a nice plus and the pumpkin seeds added depth to what could have been a flat salad. I was particularly pleased with the sliced avocado on top of the salad because I love avocado and rarely get a full one in a salad. I asked for the chipotle lime vinaigrette 'on top' and the dressing came mixed into the salad so it was more of an element of the dish than a last minute addition. C&B is a pretty spot on fast casual ladies who lunch destination. If you would have mentioned the concept and location five years ago, I would have said you were crazy. After being there a couple of times, I don't know what took so long.

They were generous with the scoop sizes and overall, the hubby and I were happy.  I was a bit annoyed when the man helping us put a limit to the number of samples we tried between us to 3, when we ordered 4 scoops of ice cream.  It wasn't like we were not ordering each thing we tried.  I found this off putting as we were ordering scoops as we went.  I did not appreciate the attitude.
  
The hubby had the chocolate obsession and chocolate peanut butter in a cookie cone.  Both these flavors were very tasty, but the peanut butter stood out.  The cookie cone was not tasty.  It reminded me of that children's cereal, but much worse.  It was superbly hard and tasteless.

I had the red velvet cake and the birthday cake.  The red velvet was delicious.  I greatly enjoyed it.  The birthday cake was the 4th flavor that I was not allowed to try.  I liked it, but found it over sweet.  I still ate it all. 
We were filled with heavy cream and took off to walk it off.  

Overall, this is a good ice cream shop.  It is certainly not the best I have ever had.

However my last experience was the most atrocious experience I have ever had.  I understand that it was the first opening day and some hiccups are to be expected, but Friday is quite beyond.  First we arrived at our reservation time of 7:30.  Once we arrived we were told by the very disheveled matradee that they were running about 30 minutes late.  No issue so we took a walk around the block.  We arrived back at 8 and were told we were the 2nd table to be seated after 1 couple and they were cleaning 2 tables at that moment.  We sat on the bench at which point I watched him seat 2 couples.  Then another customer who showed up later than us went and said something and he sat them at a 4 top.  At that point I went back up and he looked at his computer and couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and looked confused.  He said I'll be the next couple and said here's a $25 gift card.  It was only $15 when I opened at home.  We waited another 15 minutes at which point a waiter started going to everyone including us to tell us they were out of food.  

There were multiple chances to tell us they would be out.  Instead we waited and waited, watched other people be seated when we were due to be next.  I rather write to you directly then putting my review on social sites as I think you should know about my full experience.

My girlfriend got Eggs Benedict that she really enjoyed. I ended up getting the cheesesteak omelette with their special wiz sauce on top. I didn't ask how they made their sauce but I suspect it's a mixture of wiz cheese and heavy cream; it was to die for. The entire meal was phenomenal. Their menu is also very eccentric which, as a foodie, I really enjoy. 

The staff is very friendly and informative. They also have a lot of drink specials. If you love Bloody Mary's you'll love it there.

We tried to call owner and had to leave message. He then had his son call us and ask where we were and that he would meet us and fix it. We had to ask for tools to ensure we didn't break down again.
After then proceeding to Mt Lemmon, 2 bikes had to turn back because they weren't running correctly.
We then called the owner and stated we were turning in the bikes after only a few hours of driving.
When we asked for our deposit back we were informed that we could have continued to drive the bikes and we needed to give a 48 hour notice.

Beautifully designed space, with a nice ambience to it. Music is neither too loud nor soft. Logo is simple and nice. Menu has a nice feel with minimalistic approach in design. Overall, the interior design is one of my favorite things about this place.

Service - 3/5

Host is friendly and the waiters are nice. Nothing extraordinary. The only thing I thought (and maybe it wasn't appropriate for me to expect?) was that there would be an introduction to the sushi sampler/omakase we ordered. I'm clearly not a sushi expert so I had no idea what I was eating, but I kind of wish I did. I guess I was used to an intro/story typically offered at other sushi places for an omakase.

Food - 3/5

What I ordered the few times I've been here:
Rittenhouse Roll, J&J, Omakase/Sushi Sampler & Fried Oysters 

The rolls were great. I enjoyed the Rittenhouse Sq Roll thoroughly and the J&J was good to taste. The fried oysters and sushi samplers weren't my favorite. The fried oysters were too sea watery for my taste, and the sushi samplers didn't feel too fresh to me.

Price - 2/5

For the price of the food, I would expect a little more from the food and service itself. The interior design matches what I would expect in pricing. 

Overall I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. Thank you for the experience!",2019-06-18 20:53:39

There's the sushi bar as well as a full alcohol bar with seating to be at. There are small 2 seater ""booths"" that would be cute for dates  as well as large tables that have a mix of a sofa seating as well as chairs. 

They do take opentable reservations! However, when we got there, it wouldn't have been an issue to get a table - but we also went at 8 Pm on a Wednesday:) 

Starters:

Blood orange fluke - best part of the meal. The fluke was so gooood and went really well with the capers, blood orange, and radish pieces! I couldn't get enough! A must ORDER!! 

Rock shrimp: this was good as well!! I liked it because it wasn't coveredddd in sauce or heavily fried. It was the perfect balance of sauce and batter  - there was radish pieces as well - which I loved! Gave it a nice, refreshing crunch to your bite. 

Lobster rice - this was just your usual fried rice ... with lobster and mushrooms. Some at my table said it was too salty - I think it was the mushrooms - but the rice itself was decent. I'd order it if I wanted fried rice ‍

Soba noodles with shrimp - this was good too. My pick over the rice, actually. However, we had this after the rock shrimp and fluke - and those seemed to be the best! 

Sushi: 

Sushi was decent. But nothing heavenly delicious. I have yet to find a good sushi place in Philly  however, the starters were really good, which would make me want to go back and try the other dishes besides the sushi. Sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. But good place to go to take care of that sushi craving! 

The sushi that we tried....

J&J : this was the best out of the 3 we got. It tasted fresh and flavorful. It had a bit of a rich taste which made you feel full after 2! 
Broad street: this was okay. Too many ingredients made the sushi feel soggy and the flavors didn't seem to have .... flavor. Just wasn't a good combo, in my opinion.
Dynamite : your typical rollllll- which isn't a bad thing. Smaller than the first two, good to have a traditional roll with your specialities!",2018-03-29 16:40:57

Lady 1 looked like she was just going through paperwork and double checking items around the store while lady 2 was checking people out.  I found the items myself and headed up to check out.   The guest in front of us walked in in hopes to pay her PB credit card payment in person.

We waited through this conversation for our turn to check out... ... ... ... ... ... ...

I used the catering services once with the previous management and many of my guests were impressed. I was at the deli about six months ago and a fight almost broke out with the cashier over a disagreement about how much money the customer gave to the cashier. The cashier kept saying let's look at the video recording of what happened. Yesterday I went in to buy lunch. I usually use a credit card but I had decided to pay cash. I always get ready in my car because I don't want to pull out my wallet or a wad of cash. I didn't want to get any coins back if possible so I brought in a variety of coinage and a $20. bill. That way for example if it came to $17.24 which is what the cashier said it came to I would give him $20.25 and get $3.01 back instead of $2.76. I gave the cashier $20.25 and he handed me back $2.69. I said that makes no sense. He immediately gave me a receipt showing I gave him $20.05 . He then showed me a handful of nickels, said I gave him a. nickel not a quarter and said he'll prove it on his video tape. I said no give me my $3.01 , I've been coming here since before you started working here if not you will never see me again. He chose to be stubborn and dishonest so I told him goodbye forever.

However it was charging $1.50 for a coffee refill which was already the most expensive coffee refill in town.  

Now, you'll pay $2 FOR A COFFEE REFILL.  Nope...no mas! I'm done with these clowns regardless of how cute or convenient it is. Businesses can certainly raise prices per some supply and demand curve or supposed ROI or other factors as if they are just spreadsheet driven choices, but there comes a point when actual human beings will be so outraged they'll write the business off completely no matter the justification, and they'll tell everyone they know.

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with friendly smiles and a courteous staff.  While the place was very busy, there was no long wait.  Almost immediately after I was seated, Arielle was there checking on what I'd like to drink and answering my specific questions about the menu.  While I've had people at other restaurants seem irritated when I ask questions, Arielle seemed eager to answer my questions and came across as very authentic and helpful.  Her service was over-the-top, too  (not once did I go lacking for anything), but two other things stood out in my mind as well.  While Twin Peaks is a sports-bar/restaurant, they're very family friendly.  That's unusual for many sports bars/restaurants I've visited. Singles, couples, families, and sports enthusiasts waiting to watch the games were all present. And I can't begin to describe how delicious the food was!  For lunch I had ""Mom's Pot Roast,"" but to be honest mom never made it this great.  My dessert was a Twin Peaks Sundae that was amazing.  For my return trip at dinner, I specifically asked if Arielle was available.  I was informed I was in luck.  She had worked a longer shift than usual today.  I wanted to eat lighter, so I had a cup of Blonde Bean with Bacon Soup (delicious!) and asked Arielle specific questions about the items on the dessert menu I still hadn't tried.  (Again, there was no impatience or indifference.  She was warm and friendly and seemed eager to assist me in making my decision.) I decided to go for the Mini Apple Turnovers with Ice Cream and Caramel Sauce.   They were fantastic, but for something with ""mini"" in the name, I wasn't expecting such a generous serving.

The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is bright and clean. Everything is made to order, so hot and fresh.

I had trouble using their online ordering system, I'm sure that will be fixed soon.

While Sapporos remains my favorite hibachi in Indy (and are twice the price as Hibachi Express), this will remain on my list of ""go-tos"" for quick, affordable, carryout hibachi. Give this place a try!",2021-03-11 18:42:49

It started with check-in and seating. When we arrived, the two hosts, clearly flustered and whom I felt badly for if I'm being honest as they were overwhelmed, were arguing with each other over a table that had been somehow mis-seated. They audibly (and in front of other guests) tried to work this issue out but meanwhile let other guests linger in the very small waiting area in the front without explanation. 

After checking-in at 8:10pm for our 8:15pm reservation, we were told our table wasn't yet ready and when we asked approximately how long the wait would be, we were told ""tables are just lingering, so please head to the bar."" Anyone who's worked in the Industry understands occasionally this happens after check drops, especially on weekends, however to my surprise upon walking in the dining room I observe multiple open tables/tables that need to be serviced and flipped. 

We are forced to sit at the bar (where the service was really less than stellar and/or quick) until 8:45pm and I'm convinced the only reason we got a table is because a member of our party kept continually checking in with the host to inquire about our reservation. 

Once seated (and starving), we received a brief apology from our server and he noted that this ""happens around the 8pm reservation time sometimes,"" so it seems like this seating delay is a common problem Green Pheasant is aware of. We immediately ordered some dishes because we were starving. Since the first two were raw foods, they were delivered to us fairly quickly. The rest took FOREVER. We were told the kitchen was very backed up and they'd come out as they were ready. To say this was frustrating after our wait to be seated was an understatement. 

I observed a manager on the restaurant floor in our area only once throughout the night. He never did a table touch to ask about or experience in general, or to apologize for the wait for the table or food delays. There was no good faith gesture of any sort or acknowledgement from the restaurant regarding our experience beyond the very brief apology from our server, who obviously doesn't control the kitchen volume. 

The food was decent but to be honest, I was so hungry by the time any food came out, I would have eaten just about anything. 

To summarize, I would never return to The Green Pheasant and am baffled by the positive reviews of this restaurant given what I experienced, observed, and discussed with fellow diners while at the restaurant. What an extremely disappointing (and pricey!) experience.",2019-02-16 22:20:09

Well, they definitely accomplished that.  We went for dinner on the recommendation of a friend.  It was a Friday evening and we didn't have reservations so I was prepared for a wait. I was shocked when the host said it would only be 10-15 minutes. My husband and I stood up front for a few minutes until another hostess asked us to wait at the bar ""at the end of the hall"". 

We strolled down the hallway past a good number of banquet rooms and finally found the bar through an old swinging door. We stood waiting for about 10 minutes and finally decided to have a glass of wine.  The wine list is mediocre at best.  My husband went to the bar to order and the bartender had no idea which wine on the list he requested.  The bartender's quote was ""all I know about wine is red or white"". A waiter finally showed him where the bottles were.  After another 15 minutes, we wandered back up front to check on our table.  The host remembered us and said we were next.  We were seated in a cavernous booth after about a 35 minute wait.  

Our waiter came over and seemed immediately disappointed that we already had drinks.  He walked away and came back 15 minutes later to take our orders. I requested a glass of water at that point.  We both ordered pasta entrees and salads.  I got my water pretty quickly and our entrees were close behind.  We then asked about our salads that we hadn't received.  The waiter appeared pretty embarrassed and proceeded to tell us that he was so busy he was sweating and that if we wanted drinks to order now because the table next to us had been waiting about 20 minutes for another round of beers.

The food itself was okay. It was filling and the portions were well-sized, but not something worth a trip back over to Alton. In fact if we are driving through again, I would go out of my way to choose another restaurant.",2015-01-05 21:15:28

We also shared the Milky Way dessert. I ordered the pick two option, which consisted of 1/2 fried shrimp po-boy and gumbo. 

The flatbread, brussel sprouts and dessert were off the chain! I highly recommend and would order again. The crust of the flatbread was crispy. The red sauce was perfect, not too sour and not too sweet, but jussst right. It was cheesy and the fresh tomatoes were on point. I love brussel sprouts done right and these did not disappoint. Firm and roasted in olive oil. Is that bacon I taste? I don't know, but I wanted seconds. The presentation of the Milky Way was too cute. It had chocolate fudge and blondie/brownie bites, popcorn and honey roasted peanuts, on rings of caramel. All surrounding a center of orange chocolate ice cream from the Creole Creamery. I don't remember the exact name of the ice cream, though. 

My fried shrimp po-boy was good. The bread was toasted and the shrimp were seasoned. The pepper jelly glaze was a nice touch. They applied it with restraint, so the flavor wasn't overpowering. I would opt for the full sandwich next time. The gumbo was earthy with a dark roux. It reminded me of the gumbo my high school served. It was missing the rice and grilled cheese sandwich like the high school version, though. The andouille was good, but they were a bit stingy with only one piece. I think the meat was mostly turkey, which left a lot to be desired. I would've preferred smoked sausage, shrimp or more andouille. Overall, it was a good meal.

The Ambiance: This is one lovely restaurant. I would use it as inspiration to redesign my family room. The colors--navy, copper orange, tan--furniture, fabrics and decor were all breathtaking. I felt at home. It was bright and airy. They also have a cute and sizable patio for outdoor dining.

Everyone we interacted with was kind and friendly, and even though we didn't call ahead, they put our order right in and we only waited 8-10 minutes for our pizza, while browsing a magazine at their one table.

Ardmore Pizza is not someplace I'd sit down and eat (there's no tables), but I'd get their take out. If the level of service we got in the shop was any indication, their delivery guys are probably awesome, too. The pizza we got was fresh and hot, with tons of cheese and a crispy crust. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but I could dig it. I'd be curious to try other types of pizza, since I had gotten the BBQ chicken, and thought that may have influenced the sweet flavor in the tomato sauce a bit. I've also heard their cheesesteaks are killer. More to try!

Weather strikes again and my courtyard reservation had to be moved inside! I arrived early to my reservation, and while many tables had recently been moved indoors because of the weather, the hosts were happy to acknowledge my table would be opening up momentarily. At the bar, I ordered the Gentle Sage (gin, grapefruit, sage) that I had seen online and the manager ensured my drink would be added to my tables tab. I was really impressed by the staff's hospitality and flexibility due to the weather and how an event like that can really throw a wrench in the gears for a small place.

Our server Rebecca was attentive and upbeat, happy to share personal recommendations and ensure our drinks were plentiful.
The menu is expansive and it was hard to choose, so I kept my paper copy to check off the things I had tried, and want to try. A nice detail were the notations indicating vegetarian, and gluten free options! 
We shared the bacon wrapped dates (slap yo momma!), tuna tartare and the sunflower seed salad (I really delighted in the toasty seeds and shaved cheese-not a salad I'd pick outright so it was a delight!)
For mains, we tried the truffle and thyme frittata and the small mushroom pasta with added lump crab. My runny egg was hard boiled but thankfully not over cooked and there was no way I'd be sending my dish back just for the egg. If they are sous vide poached eggs, I hope they recalibrate.
The wine was delicious and the variety of pour sizes was a nice option if you wanted to bounce around and try your palette out on several varietals.

Finally got around to visiting for brunch a few weeks ago and it did not disappoint. We were able to sit in their cute courtyard and enjoy the nice weather. All staff were masked and the tables were decently spaced out. 

The brunch options were most pleasing; it was a little hard to choose. We decided to start with the jump lump crab deviled eggs which were light and a great way to open the meal. The crab was fresh and it was a great twist on a classic favorite. For our meals, I settled on the Apple Fritter French Toast and my friend got the Cochon De Lait Benny. 

That french toast? *chef's kiss*. The bread was thick and held up really well against the caramelized fruit and syrup. The pecans offered a nice crunch that broke up some of the richness of the dish. If you're into more sweet/dessert-style brunch options, get this! I wish I could have eaten more but I didn't want to overstuff myself. The Benny was equally as delicious. I loved that their take on it with using a grit cake instead of an English muffin or biscuit. The pork was tender and flavorful and the greens were rather tasty for a restaurant.

OK Maylie's (which closed in the 80s was kind of run down but it was still beautiful and that wisteria vine was gorgeous in the spring). Definitely a 5 star space especially considering the last incarnation that was here.

My review is for the brunch menu only. The menu was interesting and had some variety to it. The winner was the dutch baby pancake... that lemon curd was to die for. Even my friend who isn't into sweet breakfast was swayed. One friend had the crab cakes which she said were good but was raving about the duck fat potatoes underneath. The other friend had the couchon and grits. And I had the smoked salmon and egg. So here's the thing each of our dishes had a poached egg and none of the eggs were poached properly. All the yolks were set and for one of us the yolk was set but the white was somehow undercooked. It was weird. 

For my salmon dish, it was tasty and the salmon was well cooked and not overly salty, but the hollandaise (of which there was maybe a tablespoon) was only on the egg, when the salmon could have used the moisture. I think the dish could be excellent with a bit better plating and egg cookage. 

Our drinks were tasty (mimosas and an old fashioned). And they were offering a Veuve special which we did not participate in. One of my friends has been to their happy hour and said it was great but they don't have any information on that on their website.

Then when she died they fun raised off her passing. She and her twin sister were both generous donors. Unfortunately the plaque they put up misidentifies one of their gifts. No one seemed interested in getting it corrected. They have a large art show annually that's a big fundraiser. They once had a very nice cantor. Need to do a much better job on outreach and community support and involvement and focus less on fundraising and being insular. That's my 2 cents. Be Loving.,2020-10-07 16:30:04

Nobody picks up the number (800-432-3117) listed on the support page that hangs up without any message or option to leave one.  

To make matters worse, they insist on asking for my social security number in public settings even when I request they ask each digit in a non-consecutive order in order to protect me from identify theft.  However, 5 supervisors refused this simple request to write down 9 digits and then type it into their system by saying they can only hear the number in consecutive order.

Other times that I've come here, they've sold out on the pork scallion roll. I was so glad to see they actually had some when I stopped by!! Finally got to taste it and I was not disappointed. The bread is so soft and tasty. It has the light taste of pork and scallion. I honestly expected a little more scallion to be in it, but it still tasted delicious. For those not familiar with this kind of roll, forewarning to those who don't like mayonnaise: it has a mayonnaise-like spread inside. I personally think it enhances the roll.

I also tried their roast pork bun for the first time. Do not miss out on this if you like roast pork !! This is a great combination of sweet and salty. The bun itself has the sweet topping and it's filled with the roast pork inside. I regret not buying more than one, especially because it's so affordable. :(

We started with shishito peppers which turned out to be the best of what we had tonight. Good but not so great I would return just for that. We had the tuna tartar which had a decent flavor but was warm and chopped up so much that one would wonder if they were trying to hide that they were using poor quality tuna. Imagine room temperature cat food on top of warm rice cake. The whole thing did not work. 
Then to the entree. The steak was good but salty. The spicy crab pasta which is their signature dish came out cold and way after the steak. When we told the waiter it was cool, we were told it was because the noodle was rinsed and would never be piping hot. I'm sorry but a bit warmer than cold doesn't cut it. This was also very salty and I was told it was because I asked for spicy and they added chili sauce. Really?  The chef does not know how to make things spicier without making it so salty you can't eat?  So to save time and by this point my husband had already finished his steak so I asked for some plain hot noodles to be added. 
They brought some dumplings while waiting which was a nice touch but please don't bother ordering. They are less than tasty. 

Finally the noodles came out and they added garlic butter which made the plain pasta salty again. JAPANESE FOOD DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SALTY. 
By now we were ready to get out of this pretentious place. The bill came out and they had charged us 14 for the noodles. So they charged 26 for salty lukewarm entree that was not edible as it was, then charged 14 more for what I had hoped to be warm plain noodles. So basically we were asked to pay 40 for a mediocre dish. We complained and they took it off the bill but that should have never happened. 

My prediction is that the place would not survive if they do not improve the quality of their food. You cannot survive on looks and cool vibe alone.",2019-04-06 01:32:10

jPczuNCANenfWVaJHQnzeA,JlUFYRdIvbElmUqQX8wF8w,QdN72BWoyFypdGJhhI5r7g,2.0,0,0,1,"I've been on a search for a good, under $20, pasta option for a little while. Bar One isn't it.

     Let's start with what it is, though. Can you go have a beer with your friends, and watch a little of the game? Yes, you definitely can. Do they have a beer list which comparable to other crafty, Philly spots? Yes, definitely. Is it crazy expensive, or crazy crowded? Nope...it's ostensibly a neighborhood bar.

     By no stretch of the imagination is it an Italian restaurant. Frankly, I'm not sure why Bar One even bothers to pretend it is such...perhaps the neighborhood, or proximity to the market...but at any rate, fine Italian cuisine it is not. Excited to try a new spot, stopped in on a brisk Friday in November and, ordered the cavatelli with Gorgonzola sauce and sausage. The most notable issue was that there was no sausage. Strike one. I could not identify the flavor of Gorgonzola in the pale grey sauce either. Let it be know that I love blue cheese, and a little goes a long way with said ingredient; it's a strong flavor. This, however, tasted more like a bland rue. The pasta itself was stuck together in clumps, which made me wonder how it was prepared...pasta doesn't do that in a sauté pan.  It was thoroughly underwhelming. 

    It's also worth mentioning the staff...or at least one bartender.  My gent was fine. He seemed to have a little trouble getting around, but was courteous enough, and managed my order with no issues. There was another, much ruder, gent who spent the evening - or at least the time that I was there - trying to recruit customers into belittling the other bartender (the one serving me). ""Can you believe he has a degree in music?!?!...in MUSIC?"", he asked me with his absurd Thomas Shelby haircut and manicured beard. ""Who does that?!?"", he continued in his effort to impress himself. I absolutely did not take the bait; nor did most of the other customers, in what I can only expect was everyone trying to extend common kindness to a man just trying to do his job. 

     Let's have a reality check here. 1. Publicly belittling others lacks both character and professionalism. Full stop. 2. I have a degree in music, and what has been (so far, thanks be to God) a lasting & rewarding career in the Arts. So, what was meant only as unnecessary posturing between staff members, deeply offended your clientele. I chose not to engage the argument, because that is in no way what I'm looking for in a dinning experience...an argument with an arrogant, yet poorly-informed bartender. The phrase ""service industry"" springs to mind...SERVICE...since we like to repeat ourselves. In conclusion, the food was edible but not good; yet it was the utter pretension of Mr. Shelby which will ensure that I will neither spend another singular dollar, nor recommend Bar One to any of my friends or readers. #Service",2019-11-16 18:08:40

Firstly, the server forgot to bring the soups out. I only got to ask where the soups were after she had placed the entrees down. She had mentioned to us that she was serving many tables. Maybe our server was in a bad mood or she was being overworked. However, my seating area was near the kitchen and I watched as servers either stood around or complained to each other. I got the vibe that no one working there wanted to be there or be bothered to give a good eating experience. 

Another example of the service was when I had asked the server if she could put my gift card code into the check. She said she would ask. After desert, when the check was given, she completely forgot to ask about the gift card. The matter was resolved but it does make me question if anyone working is paying attention. 

For the food, it was pretty tasty. The bread was good and I appreciated the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix. For an appetizer, we ordered the caprese salad which was the nice ratio of tomato to mozzarella. For my entrée I ordered the Cafe Milano which was also yummy. The ingredients such as the mushrooms tasted fresh and the chicken was well seasoned. The tiramisu was really good  and I'd come back here only to eat that. 

I want to mention that you are paying for the ambience of the establishment. The food is marked up by a lot which I would not mind if it weren't for the sub par service and atmosphere as mentioned earlier.

I typically pay off the entire balance of the card each month I use it.  However, while booking a Southwest flight on the Southwest's website, a Chase offer for $200 off for opening a new account popped up. Since I had thought about opening a new account with better perks and taking advantage of the $200 off for the 4 tickets I need, I clicked on the link. I received a message that the link would not go through, I tried a few more times unsuccessfully. I went directly to Chase's website to apply and was immediately (within 2 seconds) approved, (yes Chase I have excellent credit that's why you immediately approved me). So I call Chase to see how now I can take advantage of their promotion. The first person I spoke with said the $200 is not offered on this card, but 40K points is after the first $1k of card usage. Frustrating, but ok I need the tickets, so how do I utilize the card to take advantage of the 40k points? She says you can use the digital wallet. I ask how do I do that, she says, ""well some people get the digital wallet and some don't"" OK how do I get it? I understand you cannot give me the entire card number, but surely someone can help me and why do some get the digital wallet and and others don't, can you send me the digital wallet. She says not I can't it's out of my control. I ask to speak to her supervisor. He is an absolute ahole. Says what the rep said is absolutely correct, that I should have clicked on the link, to what I said again the link did not work. Rep said some get a digital wallet others don't, again I ask for the digital wallet, he says I can't send it you will have to wait 10 days for the card. We went around and around a few minutes about the lack of connecting to the link provided on Southwest's website; and the digital wallet before he says there is not digital wallet!! What your rep said it, he said it and now no digital wallet? I explained I need the tickets to get family here for a funeral service. He says why didn't I use my other Southwest card? Huh! Because I wanted to use the promotional offer, an offer that is not exactly what it was promoted as at that! My Gawd!  Chase you make sure your promotional links work, better train your employees and the supervisor definitely needs some customer service skill training as well as how your credit card offers work. He apparently does not know since he kept  changing excuses of why he cannot help. He apathetically said well, there is nothing we can do, do you have any other questions for me. I hung up on him So basically I see it as Chase running a bait and switch with their promotions. I will be contacting the FTC, Federal Office of the Comptroller, Federal Reserve and any other regulating organization.  
UPDATE: I called the corporate office who sent me to the escalation department, who sent me back to Chase Credit card where I spoke to who I think was a manager named AJ. AJ was much more pleasant to speak to. He said he read the notes from my call to the two imbeciles and apologized, what the two failed to say is the digital wallet is Apple Pay or comparable on Android. Instead the imbeciles acted as though Chase sends an email with a digital wallet as in an online or temporary card. He provided me with my full card number but not the exp date or security code. Something the imbeciles did not do even after just like for AJ I provided my SS# (which I am uncomfortable doing) so they could access my account.  AJ said I should be able to get the Apple pay with only the card number. He was wrong about that, it can't be done.  I'm back to square one, but at least AJ knows how to communicate. 
Chase still needs to fix their links, stop with bait switch tactics and address their staff training particularly of those who are supposed to be customer service supervisors.",2021-09-03 19:18:13

According with DOT.GOV, the way this ticket was sold (hiding the actual carrier operating the flight) is illegal.  As per your convenience I already filed a complaint with the DOT, you are welcome!

Code sharing is fine, but selling a ticket on an airline and having it code shared with another, then code shared three times more, then subcontracted after the carrier went out of business without any way of me knowing it at the time of purchase is not. 

Which airline is operating your flight?
Sometimes when you book a ticket, the airline that you purchase the ticket from will not be the airline operating your flight. Airlines often partner with each other so that one airline markets a flight to consumers (displays a ticket price and sells a ticket) while another airline is responsible for operating the flight (flying you to your destination). When airlines engage in such an arrangement (code-sharing) they are required to clearly and prominently identify the airline that is operating the flight(s).  During the booking process, this information must be clearly and prominently displayed on the first screen that appears following a search for a specific itinerary. Airlines cannot provide code-share disclosures through roll-overs, pop-ups, and hyper-links. Airlines are also required to clearly and prominently identify code-share partners in all advertisements and on ticket confirmations following the purchase of air fare.",2019-10-03 18:20:42

The owners were both there when I went in and they clearly have a passion for great coffee and rehoming cats! If coffee isn't your bag - they sell Cally's Teas and three spacial blends they made just for them.

The cat lounge itself is clean and well arranged with a few chairs and loads of nooks for snoozing cats, a castle climbing frame and loads of shelves for cats to climb and hide out.

3. The miso butter on the steak is very good,  we mixed it into the hot      plate with everything but next time might try it on the side for dipping.  It wasn't bad but I think we overpowered the other flavors with all the butter.

I have never had a late payment and have never had a single credit limit increase in 5 years!!!! I have well over a 700 credit score and thought it was more than reasonable to ask for a credit line increase (cli). So, I emailed customer service -since there is not a automated online system to request a cli - and my Amazon credit card was increased within a few days. The other two credit cards were denied weeks later. Their explanation was I had 'too many credit inquiries and newly opened accounts within the last 2 years'. At this point I'm shocked...I have credit cards with almost every other credit company (Capital One, Citi, Discover, Barclays, TD Bank, Bank of America, and Amex), and not one of them denied me for that reason if they denied me at all. 

So, I think there must be a mistake. See, in addition to there not being an automated cli system, each request is a HARD HIT on your credit report. So, not only did they deny me a cli on a 5 year old account -with no balance- but they also added three new inquiries which negatively affects my credit score for 6 months and remains on my report for 2 years. 

I was surprised, insulted, and dumbfounded. So, I emailed them back and nicely explained that this was very unfair. To not only add hard hits to my credit report but then reject me, for a harmless cli. They then said they would review everything again and I was hopeful.

So when my friends decided to go out for a pint before an event on Friday, Twin Peaks seemed like the best (and only) choice. I'm not a huge fan of ""titty restaurants"" like this to be honest because I hate that an establishment's theme is around women wearing revealing clothes as they wait on you. It seems rather sexist. But, that's just me being a prude. I'm also not a big sports bar person, as I find all of the TVs to be rather distracting for good conversation over dinner. But, Twin Peaks wasn't that terrible.

Our waitress was very friendly (and not just for the sake of garnering more tips). She legitimately seemed like a nice gal. She wasn't quite knowledgeable on all items on the menu though. Even if your serving at a place that's not a 5-star restaurant, you should still be able to recommend a few things off the menu if you can for the benefit of your customers. She also was a little slow to get to and from our table with our drinks, which I found odd since we were seated right by where the waitresses request drinks of their bartenders.

As for the drinks, VERY sweet. I ordered some kind of boozy lemonade off their drink specials menu, and it was mostly simple syrup/sour mix. Maybe this makes me a functional alcoholic, but I like to taste a little nip of the booze in my drink and not just sweet and sour. I had a taste of one of their house beers (all of which are themed with some kind of lumberjack name) and it was decent. Not anything to go out of your way for, but I could definitely tell this was more of a beer joint than a mixed drink place. Perhaps the bartenders are used to pouring more pints than mixing liquor drinks for all the men coming in to this watering hole.

The food was decent. Twin Peaks definitely redeemed itself in this area. I had some of the mozzarella bites to start, which were quite tasty -- lightly breaded and fried with molten cheese in the center...you can't go wrong with these. I also tried a few bites of the blackened fish tacos -- also very decent with a tangy chipotle mayo that came on them.

After our event, we ended up coming back to Twin peaks for another round and some of the gals came and chatted with us at our table. It was a nice distraction from all of the TVs that were vying for our attention in the place. I can't say that Twin Peaks will be my regular watering hole, but it is convenient, not terribly expensive, and they about the only interesting bar in the Castleton area with PLENTY of seating for a group.",2016-05-17 14:29:57

It is beautiful, tastes great, and is welcoming. BUT and this is a very big BUT for me. I understand that this business is new, and it's busy so I have given it some grace in that regard towards the issues I have concerns with but after happening to me on 7 different visits now I have to say I'm fairly dissapointed. 

Whomever is in charge of doing orders for Roast really needs to figure out how to order in abundance or order more than they normally do or whatever it may be. I have gone there on 7 different occasions to order different drinks each time and I am always told ""sorry we're out of this, or we're out of that"" Thus forcing me to order a drink I could get anywhere and was really less than thrilled about trying. Especially when it's a feature drink that you read on their FB page and decide yum! I'm going to go try it out and both times you visit during that special they are out of it. I once tried to get their Powered Chai literally 4 days in a row and they were out the entire time. Which was fine because I understood that they were new and the order had to come in and they gave me the option of trying their tea based chai. The time after that it was Pumpkin, the time after that it was the Apple Juice (out of Apple Juice?) 

I do love the atmosphere which is what keeps me going, and the drinks taste just fine, the desserts are delicious, and the service has been great, but the order issue is a serious bummer and definitely has me wanting to take the trip downtown for coffee meetings with clients less and less.

HOWEVER, when we were seated we got our menus ordered a bottle of wine (that came out very promptly, thank goodness) and two appetizers: bruschetta and artichoke dip. We didn't get our appetizers until 8:19pm. After waiting forty minutes for our appetizers we were finally able to order our entrees which also took forever. I don't remember when we ended up leaving but it was way too late and after 9:15pm and several of us were not satisfied with our meals and didn't even eat them but at that point we just wanted to get out of the restaurant and never return. 
Throughout our meal there was a lot of apologizing and blaming the kitchen and the chefs but with all of that blame I was surprised that a manager didn't come check to see if everyone was okay. That wouldn't have helped the experience because I won't go back but usually if there is that much wrong with the kitchen someone will come out and apologize or comp an appetizer or SOMETHING. 

Anyway, long story short, the whole thing was really weird and way too long. The food is way too expensive and mediocre to justify the price and wait when you can just get some pasta roni for $1 at the grocery store.",2019-04-08 03:21:21

We came around noon and they were already out of most of the items in the pastry window. I wanted to try a jalapeño cheddar scone but they were out so I settled for the blueberry. It was good, a standard scone but nothing wrong with it.

I ordered the squash salad as my main dish and my friend got the avo toast sans egg. She really enjoyed hers but it is difficult to mess up avo toast. I have heard from several people that that is their go-to at this place so I may try it one day.

My salad was so so salty. I can't even remember what the rest of it tasted like because I was overwhelmed by the salt. Not sure if they seasoned it too heavily or if the dressing was too heavily salted but I was disappointed as I couldn't taste the squash or squash blossom flavor, or anything else in the dressing. 

I wish that I'd ordered something else. Overall, I would come back for a pastry maybe but probably not a sit-down meal. They don't have a ton of options and they're all pretty expensive. I also wish they'd stocked the pastry window more heavily as they were open for a few more hours and it was mostly empty. Not a bad experience but not a great one.",2020-08-18 22:57:40

Wine...
I had a glass of the house red and it was not very good, there are many inexpensive wines that taste decent but this was definitely not it. I ordered the Italian Chianti for my second glass.  

Food...
Ordered the Pollo Caprice and was disappointed. First it was salty, the mozzarella was salty, the arugula salad (was very very small portion, about 1/4) was salty & the grilled chicken breast was not only salty but rubbery, it was obviously cooked from frozen and had fake grill marks. Definitely not worth $17, go through any drive through for a better piece of chicken for 25% the price!

Service...
Was quick and friendly, I only have positive comments for the service. 

My wife and I use to love Macaroni Grill and I wondered why I've seen so many locations shutting down, I was in Reno and saw this location was open and decided to stop in for a nice meal but was disappointed and feel like I was ripped-off in the process, so now I understand why there're going out of business, and why I'll no longer be a patron.

C&B is a specialty market and cafe which started in Charleston, SC and I've not seen anything like it in my time in Nashville. The interior is immaculate from their perfect displays of pastries and sweets to pre-made salads and wines. Whether you are there to shop, eat or drink you will be impressed by the novelty of everything in C&B. 

The place--
It took me a few seconds to orient myself settling my eyes upon the different stations available to order food. Did I want a salad, a sandwich or to grab something to go? It was a bit much to take in at first then I appreciated all the choices. When I was waiting for my order I was thoroughly entertained. Although I got my order to-go since I work nearby I would think it would be fun to dine in as well. 

The food--
I ordered the Tennessee Trio sandwich ($10.50) which had porchetta, pork belly and bacon jam along with cheddar, pickled sunchokes and arugula on a ciabatta roll. The flavor was all there and it was a very filling sandwich. The porchetta was a bit too crispy for me and the sandwich was a little too rich for me to order it again but I did like it. I got a bag of Zapp's New Orleans Kettle Style voodoo chips ($1.95) and a small blueberry hibiscus iced tea ($2.60) to go with my sandwich and my total was $16.44 which is a bit steeper than I want to pay for a sandwich, drink and chips but for a splurge every now and again I suppose it's okay. The iced tea is not sweetened at all in spite of the blueberry I picture being slightly sweet naturally, this was not at all. If you want a little sweet I would suggest putting some sugar in before sitting down. 

The service--
My drink and sandwich took only a little bit to order. It can be a bit off-putting to have to go to two different counters to order but it didn't take much time. The front register for the barista will check you out if you get anything from one of the back counters.

Ice Cream:
This place had a pretty good selection of flavors to choose from, and from  what I've heard, they change flavors quite a lot (probably due to some seasonal flavors?). I taste-tested a few of the flavors, and got myself a double-scoop cone with Tennessee Fudge and Loaded Caramel.

First off, they give you HUGE scoops of ice cream. Usually, two scoops is a lot, but I didn't expect to get scoops that completely dwarfed the cone I was holding them in by so much. I was pleasantly surprised.

Second, when it came to the flavors I got, the Tennessee Fudge was amazing. I have no clue what they do with it, but that was some of the best ice cream I've ever had. The Loaded Caramel, meanwhile, was also very good; maybe on par or a little better than the Sea Salt Caramel that I've gotten at Salt and Straw.

I didn't get fancy with the cone I got; I just ordered a sugar cone. So, I don't think I can really review that part, but the main attraction would be the ice cream, itself, anyway.

Overall, it's some of the better ice cream I've had in quite a while.

Rating - 5/5


Service:
Not much I can really say here. The people who served us allowed us to try out the different flavors they had, and gave us our orders without much hassle. Basically, they acted in standard fare for a typical ice cream shop.

Rating - 5/5


Value for Money:
Perhaps this is slightly influenced by the prices I've seen in Seattle (where I currently live), but Mike's Ice Cream gives you quite a lot of ice cream for the amount you pay. Of note, for a double-scoop, I paid around $5, and got more than I usually would at places like Salt and Straw (which costed me way more for something similar). Furthermore, flavors like the Tennessee Fudge, alone, make the price worth it.

Rating - 5/5


Overall:
I've been to several ice cream shops in Nashville during my stay (places like Pied Piper Creamery, Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, etc). Of them all, Mike's ranks as my favorite. I'd definitely recommend checking it out while you're around Broadway.

We started with edemame, tuna tartar, tuna curdo and seared tuna salad. They were all amazing but my favorite was the tuna curdo which is basically thin slices of raw tuna in a delicious sauce. Order this app it's incredible.

Moving on to the rolls... We had the old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna and some yellowtail sashimi. Let me repeat the quality of fish they serve he is the best I have had period. All of these rolls were extremely tasty but my favorite was the peppered tuna! It comes with an amazing wasabi drizzle and the tuna is pepper crusted.

We started with the Broccolini (shrimp, crumbled corn bread, and broccolini). The broccolini was bright and crisp-tender. The shrimp were perfectly cooked. It seemed like an unusual combination of flavors and textures but it totally worked. 

We also tried the Shumai starter (dumplings filled with lobster and shrimp and sitting in a ponzu sauce). They may have been my favorite dish of the night. Perfection. 

For our larger plates, my husband and I shared the ora king salmon and the spicy crab noodle. The salmon was outstanding. It had a crispy charred side that tasted like cotton candy (in the best possible way). The salmon was served with bok choy which was perfectly cooked and paired nicely with the salmon.

Was able to sit at the bar due to a wait for tables but understandable. The bar is made out of pieces of wood that kinda scream Fixer Upper is on the DVR. The vibe of the place was urban and perfect for its location. For apps we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Tuna Crudo, Miso Soup and the Pork Gyoza. 

The Miso was $6 bucks, when I asked my companion was it $6 bucks worthy there was a reply of lacking flavor but the size was equivalent to 2 $3 bowls somewhere else. 
The Brussel Sprouts: Now I confess I hadn't had brussel sprouts since at least 12 and that pushing it but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try them roasted instead of boiled and I am now a fan. The sesame oil was perfect and they were charred just enough to elicit the flavor of the sprouts to be slightly sweet.
Tuna Crudo: My companions loved this dish and advised the truffle oil was slightly overwhelming but delectable.
Pork Gyoza: Always good and great with the left over truffle oil

The perk of sitting at the bar was watching the chefs make the rolls and trying to figure out which one was ours. There is a mirror above the bar and more than once did we find ourselves staring at what was going on. We ordered 4 rolls to share: Fishtown, Old City, J&J and the Real California. The J&J was my favorite the shishito pepper would kick in right at the end for a spicy finish. The Old City looked to be the most popular coming off the bar and it made sense - its a instagramable plate in its own right and has a good flavor combo. I initially ordered the Fishtown and depending on what piece of fish you got on top kinda determined if it worked in my opinion. We decided to try the Real California roll for fun and honestly I could have done without.

This place is almost like an classic ice cream parlor with classic flavors and that classic 1950-1960s atmosphere. A lot of the flavors include regular flavors like strawberry, rocky road, and cookies and cream, as well as more unique flavors like Tennessee Fudge and red velvet. Other than scoops and cones, they also offer sundaes, milkshakes, smoothies, and coffee!

The shop has a good amount of seating but it seems somewhat limited with the long lines wrapped around the store and outside. However it was quick to pass through and walking around and eating ice cream is much more fun anyways. Prices are cheap as well! This was a great sweets option in Downtown Nashville.",2016-10-16 21:29:55

Helena Avenue, whaddayaknow? If you see a restaurant called The Lark, keep walking past the patio seating until you see the Santa Barbara Wine Collective. Entrance is the same (same owner actually), and you will see some signs and bread on display. 

On the menu you will find baked goods, pies, drinks, artisan bread, and a limited amount of food items. Breakfast is served all day, they make a great brioche breakfast sandwich and smoked salmon bagel. Lunch starts at 11AM, you can choose from a couple sourdough sandwiches, a cheeseboard, or 
Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad. Their menu is not as extensive compared to other places, but quality over quantity. 

Before you roll your eyes, their rendition of avocado toast was pretty unique and had a couple ingredients not normally added. The sourdough was toasted a bit too long, it was hard to knife through the charred edges. On top you have a delicious spread of Carpinteria organic avocados that held everything together. Slices of cucumber (could do without), a couple of sprouts (gross), and some feta (yummy) are included. For flavor, they add a sprinkle of pepper and sunflower seeds. I also got an egg for $2. Maybe too much fluff that didn't need to be there, but a good dish nonetheless. Went well with the iced vanilla latte I ordered. 

Wonderful space to hang out for brunch (when allowed).",2021-01-19 07:09:45

So powerful abt to gag. Order stuffed mushrooms that tasted freezer burned and pepperloin and pizza. Pizza sauce was sweeter than Chuckee Cheeses disgusting. And pepperloin was as dry as sawdust even with garlic butter. I am done with this place never again. Only went cause I was reliving the old days asking myself it couldn't have changed that much....YES it can and has. This place has gone so far downhill it's not even funny. We ordered stuffed mushrooms which were good. I ordered a $35 pepperloin with white pasta and my husband ordered bacon artichoke white pasta.  Well folks it was disgusting!!!  With a capital D. The white pasta tastes like pasta and if my husband didn't have bacon in his it would have had no taste what so ever. I got the 12 oz pepperloin medium with garlic butter. When I got this $35 steak it was well done no garlic butter and no peppercorns. So I cut into it two times thinking maybe I am missing the pink somewhere... nope well done and the edges were saw dust. Sent it back the waitress brings back the same steak smothered in butter.  R u kidding me!!  How do u make a $35 well done steak go back to medium with butter??  They r ignorant and the food is worse  save your money and go to Max's time out. The food is great and a third of the price. I will NEVER go back and I will be telling everyone I know how this place has slipped and is horrible.

Yes I am a bit animated but I'm not exaggerating my experience--I truly recommend this place! Me and my friends came here for Saturday brunch to celebrate a birthday so we had it on our mind to spend some $$$. The restaurant is gorgeous. The patio was to die for; I didn't know if i wanted to sit inside, at the bar, on the patio or on the balcony (yes balcony!). Our server Justin was amazing. From the first introduction we fell in love with their personality. Great service really makes a good place a great one. Antonio also helped us towards the end of our visit. They were both funny, knowledgeable & provided great service  

We got bottomless mimosas and I swear we never saw the bottom of our glasses.... That was a first! Most places make you buy a bottle and call it ""bottomless"" or give you a glass or two but here you will keep getting that champagne refill until you LEAVE. And in great Louisiana fashion you can take your mimosa to go :) okay let me get to the food

Apps:
- Jumbo lump crab deviled eggs
- Black truffle fries
- Filet mignonette brochette (Our FAV! The mushrooms were the best part... seasoned & cooked to perfection wow)
- Pork belly & corn fried oysters (least favorite but it was not bad. I would just recommend the other apps if it's your first time)

Entrees:
- Jump lump crab Benny (our server Justin recommended this for me! I added steak on the side also) 

Cocktails:
- Bottomless mimosas (we had orange juice, cranberry, & pineapple juice. All yummy but the pineapple juice was an all around fav because of how fresh it tasted) 

- Everything's Coming Up Roses: I usually stray away from floral drinks because it's too overwhelming or not blended well but I surprisingly enjoyed this mix. Told Justin to send my compliments to the bartender fr ahah! 

Of course after we left someone told me I should've tried the beignets smh. No worries I'll be back xD",2021-11-18 14:24:17

I would give 5 stars but my food took a while to come out. My entree took nearly 45 minutes- however it was well worth the wait. I ordered the Crab Benny and it was such a delicious flavorful dish. Jasmine was very sweet and funny. She was very apologetic and even remarked that she ""had to go and cook the food herself"". She kept the atmosphere light and I did not feel rushed.

I kind of like the concept of a stand alone bibimbap place. The dining area of the restaurant isn't currently open, so you can call in an order or walk up. I walked up and ordered and received my food relatively quickly.

I ordered the dolsot bibimbap with beef. I didn't know how the dolsot bibimbap was made without the stone bowl, which usually cooks the rice while your eating, so you can a nice crust around your rice towards the end of your meal. Basically the dolsot bibimbap to go was mimicking that experience with frying the ingredients before serving. At first, I thought the portion size was a bit small, but after eating it, I was surprised how filling it was. The gochujang or hot sauce was mixed in. The food was cooked well and it tasted great. It had a good amount of spice.

The only compaint I had about this place was that it's a bit pricey for my specific order. It was close to $14 for a relatively small rice dish. Maybe next time I may order a dish without the dolsot ($1) and beef ($3) upgrade and see how it is. The vegetable bibimbap seems decently priced at $8.95.",2021-11-23 08:17:09

Homemade bread is a bit dense for my liking, but I don't like bread all that much. Signature artichoke app was on point, and the sauce/dressing was out of this world. Clams in white wine sauce were on the smaller side, but i would've drank the juice if no one was watching. Branzino special was perfectly cooked and super tasty. But the absolute best was the gnocchi gorgonzola. They make it in house daily. They were fluffy pillowy dumplings. Like everything that you want a gnocchi to be, and rarely is. The cream sauce was buttery and cheesy without being heavy (but that could've been the case because I was already levitating from the taste and texture of the gnocchi itself?). The decor was warm and melodic Italian music played softly. Luigi, the owner and native Italian, visited our table after every dish was served to check on us. He was lovely.

             starting with that no one would answer the phone or return phone calls on time. it takes days for someone to  return the call. 
              i booked a consultation appointment and while i was going there ( long trip ) i got stock  in the friday afternoon traffic . 1 hr prior  my appointment i called this place to let them know that i am running few  minutes late  for my appointment. i was expecting someone will call me on that. no one did call me . i assumed its ok to come ,because normal places would call back and say "" please , do not come ,save your time  its too late for the appointment"" etc...
            i arrived . the building  is huge and has several entrances . and i was surprised how those people would not explain how to find their  office in that huge complex.   it tells again that they do not care about their customers like normal places do .when finally i found in that huge building that tiny ""spa""  i lost additional several minutes  and i was more late. 
           when i arrived i was unpleasantly  surprised by the place . it is  a tiny "" office "" divided by walls into small boxes . they even do not have pictures of the place in the entire internet because there is nothing to show or to be proud of. they even don't spend some money to make their website safe and they offer you to enter  all your personal info on that site. 
          i was  about 20 minutes late after all the troubles  with traffic and finding the ""spa"" . after  i did come in  i met 2 women when i saw them and did start a conversation with them i got convinced even more that i am in very wrong place,and there is no way i will let those people touch  my skin and my body and will  let them mess with it using an equipment that can cause serious troubles and permanent problems .to perform this kind of treatments someone  has to have a medical dermatological degree plus some serious training on laser liposuction  which is hard to find. google it. i  do not want to get involved with people who learned how to use on/off button and spend few hours here and there on trainings. i am definitely going to a doctor`s office for the treatment  and no more cheap groupon ""spas"" !
          also is very important to let everybody  know that people i did meet were rude ,  mannerless ,  unprofessional, snapping at me and also (why to hide it ?) with the red -neck attitude . 
after i have got the worst reception i have ever seen in a public place ever , i left refusing to schedule a new appointment  .  i came there,  i saw that place and those people and thanks goodness i did not get involved .  
          the lies of the stuff , carelessness , terrible rudeness and snapping at me bothered me as well as the fact that they did not return my call and made me drive to the place more that 1hr 30 min. in the traffic( and then 1hr 30 min back ) and all that driving for nothing .
           i stepped  back to the ""office "" to get manager`s info to make a complaint . they were talking about me ,they even did not stop when i stepped in . so low !
i got the business card of theresa forster the manager and i called her right away with the complaint and left her a  message . she returned my phone  call 3 and a half days later !! telling me that her stuff was right . i asked her how she can judge  if she was not even there and she never asked me what happened and what my complaint is about !    
           dear ms.forster ,its not professional and it is not  polite to call back in 3 and a half days later  to a customer who got problems at your place and asked you to call asap.  also it is not normal to  call back and tell that your  staff is right without even listening to a customer`s complaint or without  being present at the moment when the problem has occurred . 
         no wander your stuff is rude , highly unprofessional and absolutely mannerless if they have manager like  you . 
not surprisingly  your place is empty and you sell your procedures on groupon  2 for $30. thanks goodness i did not get involved with your low class ""spa"" .",2019-03-22 04:22:54

I was so stressed. I spoke with Tiana, who is the nicest, most accommodating person and we booked our party. I texted back our RSVPs and informed all of our guests of the change. 
Less than 24 hours later I walked into Altitude to find that the tables I picked out were already decorated with our decorations. They had places set. They provided the pizza, water and utensils. It went from a stressful situation instantly to the easiest party we've ever hosted. In all, I think we had 26 kids attend. Everyone had a great time. Everything went smoothly. I thought it a little pricey but just like Tiana said ""trust me, it's worth it"". I couldn't agree more. We'll be having more parties here.

I'm not sure to whom I am applauding--their interior designers, the servers, the chefs, but everyone gets a big high five. This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Nashville. The meal was exceptional from start to finish. 

The service--
We had made a reservation on Resy through their website and we were seated promptly on-time. When we were seated we were brought warm towels to wipe our hands. Our server greeted us and was very accommodating. She was the best! 

The ambiance--
There was a slight Asian flavor to the decor but everything was very modern. Some of the seating had plush booths and some were tables. There was a center bar for people who just came to get drinks. The restrooms were very clean and to our amusement and delight they had  Japanese toilets which had a seat warming feature. 

The food--
Their menu consists of a cold section and a hot section. There aren't appetizers but the menu is mostly small plates and then towards the bottom of the menu the plates get larger. Our server went into the most detail of the menu of any server that I've ever had. It was great. She highlighted her favorite dishes but gave an explanation of how the dishes were prepared so we knew what to expect. We ordered: 
-Spicy crab noodles: buttered noodles with crab meat. My favorite, but apparently also most people's favorite since our server has said that every table will likely have one order of these. 
-Tebasaki gyoza: This dish blew my mind. Instead of the chicken stuffed into a traditional gyoza dumpling, the gyoza is stuffed into the chicken wing. It is deboned except for the end of the wing so you are getting a crispy chicken with the filling of the gyoza in the center. 
-Kinoko: These were different kinds of mushroom with Parmesan. They had such a great earthy flavor and a light broth.
-Broccolini with corn bread and rock shrimp: This dish seemed like an interesting pairing but everything worked together. The sauce for the broccolini was delicious and the rock shrimp had a different seasoning which worked together
-Wedges: This was the one dish I could have done without, but it was still good. The salad was served on skewers with dressing and shaved carrots. 

The ambiance, the service and the food was all amazing. High marks for all. The dinner was very memorable and enjoyable. I'll be looking forward to my next visit here!",2019-02-04 18:33:30

Very understaffed, probably because of Covid so I get it. Everything looked so delicious I couldn't decide. To help me decide I asked if the ham and cheese sandwich came with the cheese melted. The 17 year old surfer at the register said ""yes"". So I chose it over the pastrami. When I receive it, cheese is definitely not melted. I ask the food runner to run it back to melt the cheese real quick, I don't want to pay $15 for ham and a slice of Swiss. I want a restaurant caliber sandwich. He comes back and tells me , ""we can't melt the cheese"". My husband has, in front of him, a pastrami sandwich with MELTED CHEESE. I take the sandwich up front myself and I ask the manager to just stick the silly sandwich under the broiler for me. No biggie. She says she can't. So I tell her I was specifically informed that it would be melted and now I don't want it. Very nicely. She gives me a blank stare. So I ask her to give me a pastrami sandwich instead. Which she does. My mother in law also ordered the ham sandwich, neither of us got the cornichons that are advertised. 
The thing is, as a cook, I know how easy it is to broil a sandwich. 
So. Excellent bread, terrible ham sandwich without anything to make it worth the $$. Beautiful menu. Don't order the ham sandwich. Nice staff who don't care at all, (no water in the jug though we asked twice), and the staff need to be trained on the menu they're selling. Everything is tasty but for that price they should know how to BROIL SOME CHEESE. So now the manager will go home and complain to her partner about the crazy lady who sent back a sandwich because the cheese wasn't melted. Ok. For $15 I get to, (as long as I'm nice) insist on what was advertised. Deal.",2021-09-12 01:22:25

The whole experience was sort of a let down.... While the online ordering process was easy enough, when I arrived there was no marking or indication of where I needed to go to do my pickup and the whole process of waiting and paying for my pickup took over 10 minutes (I showed up a few minutes after their website said my order would of been ready). 

The food was also disappointing. I had ordered a pasta with creamy Alfredo Sauce and there was NO sauce on my dish at all - just oily noodles; which was a shame because the noddles and veggies were cooked well and I was thrilled with their create your own pasta idea! Moreover, the Caesar Salad was suppose to come with crotons and there was no crotons - a small thing, but the salad I got was a pile of lettuce with a weird tasting - super thick cream sauce, it was rather off-putting.  

I think that they need to work on their customer service and perfecting fine details e.g. getting orders correct - I would of been far less disappointed if my pasta would of had sauce on it!

I think people are starting to take notice of this gem, so if you are thinking about checking it out be sure to make reservations. For this brunch I didn't go with a typical mimosa. I went with a sweet red wine called Lambrusco Dolce Fiore and it was delicious. 

We started off with snacks the LA Crawfish Beignets and the Jumbo Lump Crabmeat Deviled Eggs! I especially loved the beignets, the eggs were okay. I mean I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, after all it's just a deviled egg.

They have the ceiling to floor doors that they open wide during a nice night which gives you the feel of eating outside even when you are dining indoors. It's relatively small inside so I definitely recommend making a reservation if our plan to come at a busy time. 

The service was good. A little slow but we weren't in a rush so it worked for us.

We came during happy hour and got two spicy tuna rolls and two spicy salmon rolls (which are $5 each at happy hour prices). It took a while for them to come out. I actually thought she forgot about them. They were just ok. 

My friend got the edamame which she enjoyed. I got a ginger salad. It said it had avocado so I assumed they were just trying to be different by calling it a ginger salad instead of an avocado salad. Most sushi restaurants that I go to have an avocado salad on the menu with ginger dressing and it has at least a half of an avocado on top. This salad came out almost immediately after I ordered it and it was super cold which makes me feel like it's one of those restaurants that pre-makes salads and keeps them in a fridge or cooler. The avocado was so sparse I barely even knew it was in there. Not what I'm used to! To be fair, I assumed it was the avocado salad that I get at other sushi restaurants. 

We split the lobster fried rice because so many people raves about it in the reviews. It was decent. Not amazing. It was kind of egg-y; I felt like that was the dominant flavor. 

The other special rolls I ordered are pretty forgettable. One was a KJ, I believe. That's all I really remember. I don't remember what the other one was even called or what was in either of them. What's not forgettable is the price point of these unforgettable rolls. Their special rolls cost $15 to $21 per roll. ($21? Seriously?) They were falling apart as we tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. The wasabi was more mild than I'm used to. 

The bathrooms are individual rooms for one person at a time. There was different music playing in the bathroom and it felt like a dance party. I was jamming out in there. Lol. 

There is kiosk parking located nearby. Just a short walk will get you there. I'm not sure of any lots. 

This place is great for the atmosphere but I've had wayyyyyy better sushi at a way lower price point. I feel like you are paying for the location more than anything. While I loved the ambiance, I don't really know that it would be worth returning to. I have sushi so infrequently that if I'm in the mood for it, I would rather go somewhere with better sushi and maybe not as awesome of an environment than mediocre, overpriced sushi in a modern, breezy location.

Their mink Brazilian hair is amazing, no shedding, beautiful luster, thick, extremely soft, tangle-free. BUTTT their customer service is the complete opposite. From my experience with them they do not care about the customer only the money. For the amount of money you spend there you do not get treated like a valued customer. There is no way to get in contact with them. I've called everyday for 5 days straight and have not got a answer nor my calls returned. This is the second time this happened with them. Secondly, there shipping is awful! If your in a rush to get your hair DO NOT order from them. It takes always takes about 3 weeks for me to receive my hair. Honestly, I recommend Kendra P hair.

Yesterday took a friend and her children to Tony's after apple picking.  When we arrived we were told our wait would be 20 min.  At 30 min I asked how much longer.  We were finally taken to our table 45 min after we arrived.

While waiting for our table in the small entry way, we noticed multiple occasions where the hostess desk was left unattended for 5-10 min at a time.  During these times the small entry area filled up with patrons waiting to be welcomed.

When we finally reached our table our waiter came by within a few minutes, took our drink order (all water) and 10 min later they arrived.  At that point the waiter left our table to take care of other tables.  In his absence another wait person came by and told us about the evenings specials and said our waiter would be with us soon that he was running behind. Another 5-10 mins later the second wait person returned and said they would be taking care of our table.  They took our order and after it was requested, brought bread.

We ordered an appetizer of Fried Artichoke Hearts.  Rather than receiving the entire heart, we received overly fried artichoke heart quarters.  Pathetic....not nearly worth the $8 we were charged.

When the food arrived it was disappointing.  The kids food was acceptable.  They had a burger and salad.  My friend had the Teriaki Chicken Kabob and I had the Garlic Chicken.  When my friends dish arrived all that was on the plate was the kabob....no side, no garnish, no nothing.  Definitely not restaurant quality presentation. She commented the taste was ok, but nothing special or worth the long wait.  My garlic chicken was advertised as being pungent, which to my mind meant you'd really taste the garlic.  Not so.  A tasteless, almost overflowing amount of chicken and pasta was served in a bowl that was too small for the portion.  The dish was supposed to have onions, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, chicken and garlic over linguine pasta.  I got lots of pasta, plenty of mushrooms, scarce amounts of onions, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  There was some garlic  but not anywhere near pungent. They also served a slice of garlic bread that was so hard it was inedible.  I was totally disappointed in this meal.

Due to the extremely long wait time for a table, the mediocre service, the poor food quality and the general lack of hospitality I will not be returning to Tony's.  I can't speak for my friend, but as this was her first experience I doubt she'll be returning in the future.",2014-10-19 22:11:13

If you've ever been to Jump Time, it's a lot like that but WAY better. This is a very large space with numerous different areas/ activities. 

They have a large open jump area with long trampolines as well as smaller square, individual trampolines.  Very fun to run from one trampoline to the next. They have a fun area with a rotating arm that you have to jump over-- made me feel like I was a contestant on that old TV show ""Wipeout"" lol. They have a section with jousting, a rock wall, and monkey bars. Next to that is a really nice dodgeball area, and in the back of the building there are multiple foam pits with various things to jump off of (they even have a trapeze!!). They also have basketball hoops, walls to run up, and a fun game where you have to hit a bunch of light up buttons while jumping around.

Maybe it was just because this place was new, but Altitude was extremely clean, and didn't smell like a gross old gym. They also have attendants at various places in the facility monitoring jumpers for safety. Jumping around gets very exhausting so a one-hour jump window was just enough to check everything out. They also have a really good playlist that is blasting nice & loud throughout the facility, which makes it extra fun to jump around. :) I was highly satisfied with this place & it is an awesome activity to do on a cold afternoon when you feel like you've been cooped up in the house too long!

Southern Fried Chicken on brioche (sandwich): this fried chicken sandwich was one of the most unique ones I have ever eaten, if only it was executed properly.. 
The good: brioche (golden and good crumb, grilled so it was toasty); jalapeño jam (sweet with a nice kick); black pepper bacon (peppery as advertised and extremely crispy)
The ""bad"": the chicken was incredibly crunchy and chicken well seasoned, but unfortunately a bit dry and burnt on some ends. 

I'd still recommend the chicken sandwich but I'd hope this was just an off day and that they don't aways serve burnt fried chicken because all of the other components of the sandwich were fantastic. Another gripe I have is that I ordered 3 spicy versions of the sandwich and none of them were spicy. Didn't go back because we were already on the freeway.

The biggest disappointment for BAP is the food, which is tragic. I love Korean food, and I fancy Bibimbap and korean pancakes. However, both versions at BAP were just a few notes short. The pancakes were dry and thick and fairly bland. The bibimbap, granted we got the regular version (non hot pot), was served almost at cool-room temperature without any close attention to how the flavors and texture coexisted with each other. The Japchae (noodle) was the greatest disappointment as it was served with a larger and too generous portion of white rice without any other sustenance. 

Objectively, the food was underwhelming, but if you take in the whole picture, the small and unassuming quaint place settings, you'd have a good time.

This bibimbap is a little different from others in that the spicy red sauce that usually comes on the side is actually premixed in stone bowl bibimbap. This means it's a little spicier than normal bibimbap. The regular (non stone bowl) bibimbap has plain rice.

I could have done without the flatbread. The goat cheese and the fig created a strange texture. I did not personally taste the Brussel sprouts but I heard that ""THESE ARE THE BOMB""

The place itself looks very classy and modern. Their menu have a large selection, prices are a bit on the higher end but you are getting fresh, qualify fish. Not only is the food delicious but  the presentation is also just as nice. I loved that the rolls comes in a wooden tray. Also they have pretty good green tea that they serve in a steeping pot. Be prepared to spend a good lump sum while you're here.

*LUNCH*
- Tuna Tartare - Fresh tuna and avocado. I love the rick crackers that they serve this dish with

- Gyoza - pretty standard gyoza, though the skin was not as fried and crispy as I've had at other places.

- Broad Street - Salmon is my favorite fish and this roll literally was all I could ever ask for. The salmon was so fresh and the the sauce made the roll. No need for soy sauce or wasabi or any other additional, good as is.

Mind you, it's not even worth my effort to describe the rudeness in all the different things the guy said or the way he said it (tone)... but anyway, I was told that they couldn't take the shorts off the mannequin for me because if they (the staff) broke the mannequin, they would charge me $9,000 (and then went on to tell me about a time this supposedly happened).

I don't know of any other retail store that refuses to take clothes off of mannequins to SELL them. But even if that is their rule for whatever reason, the $9,000 charge to a customer, let alone for a staff member breaking causing the damage, is ludacris and presumably a lie (at least I would hope so) considering that is exactly the type of thing that business insurance covers.

Honestly, this store isn't worth shopping at even living a block away like we do. I'd rather order online and wait a week to get my items.

All the treats and beverages here are locally sourced - Support local!

The only way to improve would be a larger location.  The cat room itself is quite small in comparison to other cat cafes in town but otherwise this place is MeOw-A-riffic!

There is also a large cafe that serves Starbucks, items from the Cheesecake Factory, and other delicious treats. I'm a huge fan of the Harvey & Sons tea. The holiday tea is spectacular. Free wi-fi as well! 

All in all this is a great place to go and get lost in a book!",2014-05-21 15:02:06

Nothing is more disappointing to me than going to a Vietnamese restaurant in the US snd order pho and it either has no flavor, to much grease, or the nasty after taste of msg. That is NOT the case here. The pho broth is so aromatic and many levels of flavor you want to drink the whole bowl.  That's not all! The egg rolls are so crispy and flavorful, easily can tell they are hand made and fresh.  Great food snd service, if they had a restaurant it would crush the others in Tampa Bay.

It has your basic guys sports bar theme similar to a hooters or tilted kilt when it comes to scantly  clad women. I will say this though, these girls seemed like they truly enjoyed working there and wasn't just working there because of lack of options. 

Also where twin peaks is beating a hooters or tilted kilt is they have a much more dynamic food selection. Not just wings pizza and beer (which they also have).

I know I'm a student, and I should be saving my money to pay off my loans, but caffeine is a necessity and sometimes the line at Tim Horton's on campus is so long that I decide to walk the two blocks down to Roast. And why not? It's so pretty inside, and the atmosphere is nice - not too casual and not too upscale to the point of being stuffy. The coffee is good. My favorite drink so far is probably the pumpkin latte, but I also enjoyed the maple bacon latte. Yes bacon and coffee together is a good thing. The food is pretty good too. They have a Thai sandwich from MRKT which was good, although I found their chocolate pastry a little dry. Prices are your typical nice coffee shop price - equal to being at a chain like Starbuck's - except Roast is a better coffeeshop.  Wifi is free and works well, except in the outdoor seating where I had a hard time picking up a signal. The staff are friendly too, and happy to make recommendations.

I got the beef bibimbop and was disappointed at the quantity and the quality. I got take out and the portion was small. The ingredients didn't even fill to the brim and they even skimped on the rice. 

The dish just tasted ""too homemade"" to me but NOT homemade in a good way. It tasted ""homemade"" like it was made by a cook that had only okay culinary skills (not homemade like your grandma's cooking). It lacked flavor and presentation. The rice was too sticky. The veggies looked limpy and tasted boring (blocky stir-fried cucumbers pieces, carrots not meticulously julienned, spinach just boiled but not seasoned). The beef pieces weren't even restaurant quality, not tender at all. The gochujang was the same stuff you can buy from the Korean super market with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I could probably make the same at home fairly easily using only oil, salt, and sesame seeds as seasoning and no advanced marinades, special sauces, or knife skills.

It didn't taste terrible, but it was underwhelming compared to bibimbop I've had at other Korean restaurants. I don't know about you but I eat out to experience dishes I cannot recreate (or would take significant effort to recreate) at home. For what you get, they should just charge $6 for a plain boxed lunch, not $10!

The cinnamon iced tea is also nothing to rave about. It just tastes like weak homemade generic green tea with cinnamon dumped in. The cinnamon doesn't even compliment the tea! $3 a bottle, too! In case you were wondering, unsweetened. Unsweetened cinnamon tastes disgusting/pointless, at least sweeten your damn tea.

I feel like this place is trying too hard to have that specialty/gourmet mom-and-pop feel, marketed towards boogie hipster patrons but the quality/creativity is just not there. I feel super ripped off!

Don't come here because it ""looks cute"" or because you like ""hole in the wall"" restaurants. Usually hole in the wall restaurants serve brilliant food but this one is not one of them. 

P.S. I put a photo of the food on my Facebook (like I always do with restaurant foods) and my foodie Korean friend said ""This is from BAP? Oh man ouch..."" I feel ashamed. For once no one was jealous of my food pic because it didn't look that good.",2016-12-07 21:27:52

I've worked in Fishers for over three years now and this was the first time I realized how many people actually live in Fishers. A lot. I realized this fact during the super massive and impressive parade. They literally shut down 116th St. for this event, which is quite a big deal considering it's a main road that runs through the city. 

The food was amazing as it should be. I mean ... it's a festival so of course I expected elephant ears, overly sugary lemon shake-ups and corn dogs. And yes, I sampled all of those. haha. As for the crowd, people of all ages attended. This is a festival for the whole family. Music, activities, crafts, food, beer, the parade and fireworks. All good stuff.

Yes, I still make regular grocery runs to Jersey, because the quality of the stores is so much better. I digress. 

The guy who works the seafood area seems to hate life and he takes it out on the crustaceans he haphazardly throws around. My first and only encounter with him was when he made me feel as if he was doing me a favor by using the same gloved hands he used to slop around a bunch of fish guts to handle the cooked shrimp I requested. (I ended up not purchasing them.)

Panhandlers set up camp outside the store and though there are security guards just inside the doors, no one does anything. 

On the bright side, mostly everything is priced competitively and I can generally find what I need (though it takes some searching since I never remember the layout of the store).

It's not being engulfed with sauce hiding all the imperfection, because it's perfect! The buns is so light and fluffy with the perfect sweetness. 

The challah French toast- perfect sweetness with the honey and the grapefruit is spectacular!!! It's juicy and crunchy. The bread is soooo soft and fluffy.

Cleanliness- the menus were all paper and it looked very unprofessional due to all the wrinkles and sauce spill. The wine glass were very dusty. The spoon for our fried rice had a hair/fuzzy on it.

Food- Sad to say, the lobster fried rice was the best part of our dinner. The wagyu beef and west coast uni was good and kinda what we expected. The king salmon ($9) and otoro ($16) was such a disappointment. Both did not taste like the fish we wanted. The quality and presentation didn't match up to what we wanted.

I shall now make a list of things that the Macaroni Grill is:
A good place to wait too long to be seated
A place with friendly wait staff once seated
A place that offers good food albeit overpriced 
Boring and a prime example of what happens when a restaurant stops trying

We went to the Macaroni Grill about two weeks ago for lunch.  I hadn't been there for the better part of a decade.  The place was vacant.  Maybe 4 other tables were full.  We stood at the podium for a good three for four minutes before we were even greeted.  

Once greeted we were sat quickly and orders were taken.  The food was very good (especially the deep fried macaroni balls and the fry appetizer).  Drinks were never empty and our waiter never let us get to low on bread.  

They really are way too expensive now for what they are and that's the deal breaker.  When the Macaroni Grill first opened they offered something that Reno didn't have.  Reno has grown and new restaurants have far surpassed this chain.  They really need to either lower prices or close up shop.

I won't go back.  It was my last visit.  If I'm craving expensive Italian, I will go to a multitude of places that now call Reno home.  If I'm craving less than expensive Italian, I will go to The Olive Garden and bring my own crayons and paper for the table.",2016-07-07 20:25:26

It was early when we arrived, 10am and the place was mildly busy with a fair amount of people enjoying the facility.  We noticed that there were picnic tables lining the lower areas for multiple birthday parties, plus they had private glass rooms off to the side for the same purpose.   The process to join in on the fun includes signing a waiver and wearing their custom grip socks.   The kids keep the socks when they leave.  

The activities centered around the trampoline theme of the place but they had activities like foam pits, dodge ball court, climbing games, jumping games, etc..  Lots to do for all ages.  As a non participating parent, I was able to follow my little one around and it was fine just in my regular socks. 

The party included pizza and cake, then the kids could go back and play.  By noon, the place was so crowded that we were glad to leave.   Overall a fun activity for a few hours.  

I have no idea of the pricing structure.

Dollar wouldn't rent the car to me now that the card I put on the reservation was canceled (and would only take a physical card- could not take the credit card info I knew by heart but had accidentally left at home), so I was pretty much stranded with no card and no way to withdraw cash. 

The Dollar rep gave me the runaround, and I went to several other service desks but ultimately was out of luck and getting desperate. Finally, one of them offered the number of the Nifty car rental service that was just off-site! Called and told Steve from Nifty my situation - he picked me up from the airport immediately and drove to their rental lot. He and the desk rep there were extremely kind, could take my card info, and settled me up with an affordable rental so quickly!

Firstly, I'm thankful a yummy place like this exists downtown. I'd decided to take my daughter on an overdue ""daddy daughter date"" to the ""big city"" as she calls it. We've never really walked downtown together but always have seen the giant buildings from afar on the highway. So this was a way to accomplish her seeing the guts of the city while experiencing something tasty for our guts. Back to the ice cream...it was worth the trip! She ordered the mint chip and I had salted caramel and the chocolate peanut butter. All three were outstanding, but would give slightly lower marks to the salted caramel (usually my fave) as the flavor just didn't seem to pop as much as the other two. The chunks of peanut butter and chocolate were also what made these two flavors amazing.

The first time, we were very impressed by the quality of the fish and the preparation of our food. The second time, the quality was still very good but it wasn't prepared as well as the first time we visited. Since this restaurant is fairly expensive, we were slightly disappointed. 

The food we ordered included miso soup, tuna tartare, Old City Roll, Fishtown roll, White Tuna Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll. We really enjoyed the tuna tartare and the Old City Roll, although the rock shrimp on Old City Roll were not cooked as tender as the first time we went. The fish in the other rolls was very good quality, but we were not too impressed by the overall rolls themselves. 

Most recently we were here on a Thursday and there was supposedly a happy hour on the lychee martini that featured the drink for $5. We were told when we sat down around 7pm that the happy hour was still going on and we could order the martini with the discounted price, which we did. The martini was delicious, however, when we went to pay the bill, our drinks were listed as full price and the same waitress we had since he beginning of the meal told us that we ordered after the happy hour was over.

Shay provided a reasonable quote ($110) and while I was flexible on date of installation, he was able to fit me in his schedule the day after initial contact. While he arrived an hour later than the appointment, I was fine with that. However, that's where the positive review ends.

Hopefully, he was just having a bad day but he basically came in, installed the lock, and IT DID NOT WORK. We tried to figure out what was wrong with it and he suggested that it was due to a defect in the lock itself (I had just bought it from Amazon a day ago and this was not my first time hiring someone to install this type of lock). He did try to see what was wrong with it at my request but seemed that he didn't want to be here or cared that the lock that he installed DID NOT LOCK OR UNLOCK. I then called Schlage's customer service and he seemed to be in a rush to get to either another appointment or just somewhere else even though he was only here for ~30 minutes and came an hour late. He just told me to stay on the line with customer service and that they could fix whatever was wrong with the keypad and then he left. I have never experienced this type of service where a locksmith does not properly install a lock and just leaves and tells me that I can call him later after I'm done with customer service to provide him my credit card info for billing.

After 30 minutes on the phone with Schlage's customer service and using my regular screwdriver to take apart the entire lock, customer service instructed me to re-put the lock together and tried to determine the source of the problem. Turns out that the AA batteries were put in incorrectly (+/- on the wrong side). After having fixed the keypad and lock myself, I called Shay to let him know that customer service had helped me fix it and the source of the problem. He did not seem to care at all. I still paid him the $110 because a contract is a contract but feel like this was the worst service I have ever had. I manage rentals on the side and am new to Philly so this was my first time hiring someone in the local area.

I will never use this service again and could have just done this on my own had I realized that paying an expert who doesn't care about the actual job, in this case, was a total waste of time and money. I don't mind the attitude or impatience but I don't understand how someone can just leave in the middle of a job unresolved and still only care about getting paid and being out of the place in 30 minutes.",2018-12-13 07:00:34

All of the bread and desserts are baked onsite via Lost Bread Co. The menu features a lot of great snacks and sandwiches, though not many healthy options. I've tried the cheese curds, wings, fries and italian market panini. All were absolutely delicious!  

The beverages menu offers a lot to drinkers but not much for non-drinkers. I've personally tried their ginger beer, which is on tap (it's great!) and virgin bloody marys (their mix is made in-house and it's delicious!). I'd really love to see some creative NA cocktails, though! For the drinkers, there's a ton of beer, plus some wines, hard seltzers and cocktails. Only a few of the cocktails are made with local spirits (shout out to Philadelphia Distilling and Manatawny Still Works) and it would be cool to see more Philly representation on that list. 

For someone like me, aka, not a kid person, Craft Hall is kind of a hard sell. This place was without a doubt made for families. It's truly a genius concept! On my two visits (so far), there were multiple children's birthday parties. That said, the space is so large that even adults-only groups can likely find some kid-free space near the front bar.

We ordered dumplings, edamame, lobster fried rice, shrimp tempura sushi, and bone-in steak. The dumplings were good, but not as flavorful as the best dumplings I've tasted. The lobster fried rice was the standout. It's a large delicious bowl, with enough lobster to actually taste, and you have plenty to take home at the end. The steak was a perfectly cooked and juicy medium. But it was a fatty piece of steak. I had to trim some of the fat myself, which was slightly annoying. But once the fat was trimmed I was in steak heaven.  Remember, I'm not a fan of sushi but I did enjoy the shrimp tempura sushi. Guess I can like sushi as long as the fish is cooked.

Though I thought this was a really random choice, the location is fairly convenient off of I-75 and an easy spot to meet since we were coming from different directions. Because this Friday night was also Game 7 of the Lightning series vs the Islanders, one of the girls made reservations for us.

Parking was insane! It seemed like a skating session was ending but people were lingering; eventually I found a spot after about 10 minutes of circling. By the time I made it up to the second floor & found my girls, it was several minutes after 7pm and they already had a table & drinks.

I'll note now that our server was incredibly attentive. Even though the restaurant was packed & very busy, she checked on us frequently. Once I arrived, she was quick to come over & get my drink order. And when another girl arrived, our server noticed almost immediately & again was promptly at our table.

One of my friends ordered the Ybor Egg Rolls to share and they were amazing! I definitely could've made a meal of this appetizer. They were fun twist on the Cuban sandwich flavors we all know - incredibly tasty & generously filled. The same friend also raved about the wings she'd ordered (& has ordered on prior visits) but I'm not a wing fan so I'll just share that she loves the wings & highly recommends them. 

I ordered the Brisket Bender Bowl and LOVED it. The mashed potatoes were not overly garlicky and the brisket was super tender & flavorful. I was eating on this for days!

So, yes, Top Shelf is not obviously located, and is slightly more challenging to visit, but they have some really great food. I was drinking Bud Light with dinner on this night (pacing myself), but one of my girls enjoyed a cocktail & another had a sangria. No one was disappointed.

Here's the flavors I got:

Red Velvet Cake (4/5):

Chunks of red velvet cake, and the color of the ice cream was a dark red! Something out of a Dr. Seuss book almost! What I loved most about it was the fact that the pieces of cake inside the ice cream were delicate and not dry. Actually pretty moist in combination with the ice cream!

Tennessee Fudge (4.5/5):

Come on now, we're in Nashville, I can't NOT get Tennessee Fudge! Almost like cookies and cream, but the pieces of cookie were bigger and tastier! It was rather delicate on the pallet, and definitely fulfilled my needs as a person with a sweet tooth!

Caramel Cone (4.2/5)

Little chunks of caramel lodged into the ice cream along with a good amount of caramels drizzle, this one was definitely flattering!

Our reservation was ready right when we got there and we sat in the upstairs dining room! Not very loud and a great view! Their menu was so hard to pick from! My party ended up sharing a bunch of appetizers since we couldn't choose just a few! 

1. Tuna tartare and caviar- amazing! My favorite appetizer out of all 6. Flavor is amazing and it spreads so easily on the crackers! Love that it comes with avocado on the bottom! 
2. Pork belly and corn fried oysters- loved these so much! Flavor was great and loved that they came with blue cheese crumbles and ranch! They come in an order of 3, but the ones we got were quite small. Taste was amazing though! 
3. Bianca flatbread- so delicious. More on the plain side on the flatbread options, so we decided to add charcuterie! Definitely added flavor to it! It was cheesy and delish! 
4. Bacon wrapped dates- I love seeing dates on a menu, I was excited to see them served at copper vine. They were warm and delicious! The syrup on top really made them worth it! If you don't like dates, I would still try it! The bacon flavor really changes the way you will think about dates! 
5. Burrata and heirloom tomatoes- literally mouth watering. My second favorite thing and maybe even tied with the tuna! The burrata and tomato mixture was just so good. The cheese was so creamy and the tomatoes had so much flavor. It came with crispy pieces of bread that made the whole burrata experience! 
6. Gnocchi Au gratin- this was good but very heavy. When it came out, it looked like baked Mac n cheese! I like that the top was crunchy and the inside was creamy. This app will fill you up fast if you have too much though!

aMvxycuh6ClHglp2nwt8nw,0dAclgpNIO90XCNwplkhmw,9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA,1.0,3,1,0,"What happened?  

It's been at least 5 years since I've eaten here, and while it was never my favorite it was decent to occasionally very good.  I only went back because it was a lunch date with my little sister and she picked it out (even though I suggested other places, she likes ""italian"" food and wanted to try this)

I realize everyone is cutting back these days, so I wasn't surprised to see they no longer had fresh cut flowers but other than that the interior was as I remembered it.  Still cozy and lovely with the dim lighting and spacious seating.  

The menu looked different from what I remembered, and they were featuring a promotional tapas for 2 menu.  1 tapa (appetizer) and 1 entree pp.  These were generally the cheaper menu items, but still a savings of $2-$6 pp if you were to order an app and entree each.  I think there was a selection of about 6 different items on each section.  They were out of the only entree that appealed to me and would not make a comparable substitution.  I wanted the chicken and mushroom cannelloni but ended up with a grilled chicken breast with angel hair pasta caprese.  My sister chose a creamy rigatoni dish with chicken.  We shared the goat cheese stuffed peppers and the zucchini fritto.  

The portions were large but the food was disgusting.  The zucchini fritto was paperthin slices of zucchini breaded and fried.  There were burned bits and other bits that were doughy and clumped together.  It lacked flavor and was greasy.  The peppers were interesting, tangy pickled peppers stuffed with cream cheese and heated then topped with fried bread crumbs and balsamic glaze drizzle.  I think they would have been much better served cold.  My sisters pasta was a giant bowl of rigatoni in a watery sauce and slices of chicken breast that look like the type of pressed chicken you get in school lunches.  Even with a lot of added parmesean cheese it was very bland.  My dish was a tough black charred chicken breast (again, tasted like formed chicken)  a glob of solidified angel hair pasta with a few cubes of mozzerella all melted together with wilted basil (I'm guessing my dish sat under a heater for a while).  The arugula salad it was served with was mostly spinach, again wilted with a dab of garlicky pesto.  I had literally two bites of food before I pushed my plate away. The chicken was dry and tough and tasted of salt and char, the pasta tasted of salt and old tomatoes.  I did enjoy the warm bread.  

Aside from terrible food, my final gripe is a petty one.  My sister ordered a peach lemonade and I ordered an ""italian soda"" which was soda water plus the same peach syrup in my sister's lemonade.  These beverages were listed together on the menu (no price listed so I assumed they were overpriced).  They were $3 each, but what annoyed me was that I asked for a refill and was told the soda did not have refills, but the lemonade did.  My soda came in a tall narrow glass packed with ice and could not have held more than 4 oz of liquid in all.  My sister's lemonade was a 20oz glass with about 1/4 full of ice.  I could understand if they opened a fresh bottle of pellegrino per soda, but this was just soda water from a soda gun so I don't see why it would cost more for refills?  Or why it wasn't listed separate from the free refill drinks like tea and lemonade?",2012-03-22 02:13:13

A few problems.  First, the beer wasn't very good (didn't have any food) and until they refine their brewing, they need to offer at least a few other local brewers' offerings.  Second, somebody is going to get hurt.  There is just too much glassware and areas where kids can fall (adults were not even honoring the no glassware on the pirate ship sign).  It really is just a matter of time.  As another parent put it, ""this is my nightmare.""

At this point, I replied that maybe the business that she was representing had an exclusion policy.

Sadly, they didn't have the containers for sundaes, so we weren't able to try their banana split and also no samples available to test different ice cream flavors. The inside wasn't terribly packed with people, but we didn't feel comfortable sticking around once we got our ice cream.

+ PARKING: Since Downtown Nashville was pretty much dead due to COVID-19, it was extremely easy to find STREET PARKING right across the street from Mike's.

+ FOOD: The ice cream is all hand-made here at Mike's and they offer everything from ice cream scoops on a cone to shakes to ice cream sodas. Their flavors aren't really as wacky as I've seen from some artisan ice cream shops, but interesting enough to put a twist on classic flavors.

The strawberry ice cream at Mike's comes with generous chunks of strawberry and I swear our ice cream took forever to actually melt. But that's maybe because we gobbled up all our ice cream too fast. It was so smooth and amount of ice cream in their scoops is generous! The strawberry paired really well with their Tennessee fudge. The Tennessee fudge is supposedly their best-selling flavor and it's a vanilla-based ice cream with ribbons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chunks mingled in. Not too rich to the point where my teeth ached, but just enough chocolate to satisfy my craving. The bits of fudge were delicious and I liked how we accidently ended up with a neapolitan ice cream combo with our two scoops.

We were also able to snag some Goo Goo Clusters here! (As if we needed more sugar in system)

+ PRICE: Competitive and even borderline cheap for the amount of ice cream they pack in their scoops. Most artisan ice cream shops I've come across would charge the same price for 2/3 the amount of ice cream Mike's gives you. For two scoops of ice cream (large), they charge about $5. What a steal!

Overall: If you're in Downtown Nashville, give this place a try. I highly recommend their ice cream and it'll keep you cool. Classic flavors and offerings with a little modern twist.",2020-10-02 20:46:00

d0HdKpKo1EmHjR_QR8rmoA,wnTKdE8qN16H48yVsp4VuQ,YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,5.0,0,0,0,"We had the most superlative experience at chic Copper Vine last night. It started a few weeks ago when requested space for a private party with 25 people within a certain budget. Not only did Mike speedily respond with the friendliest invitation and enthusiasm for our event, he kept up that standard of communication every time we emailed asking for this or that small tweak as our final guest count kept wavering and the party's dietary restrictions filtered in. He provided a quick solution at each turn. 

The food and drink menu choices he offered blew me away with the variety and creativity. Terrific balance of regional specialties and nouveau cuisine choices. I was able to make selections to accommodate all of our known food issues among guests while having a spectacular menu. The contract process was smooth and split up into two payments which made spreading out the cost very convenient. Furthermore the contract was very clearly spelled out and perfectly aligned with my own math, no surprises! 

The service itself was unparalleled. Antonio and Dylan meticulously made sure no one's beverage was empty. They accommodated ad-hock special requests (no mushrooms on one, allowing another guest to order something not on the pre-arranged menu) with cheerful professionalism. With each of the 4 courses, it seemed as though we were all magically served each plate at once. They made sure my mom - the guest of honor - felt honored without provoking any fear of a humiliating public fuss over her birthday. These gentlemen have mastered their craft. 

Onto the food! MY LORD AND ALL THE SAINTS IN HEAVEN was the culinary portion of the party beyond. Beyond what? Everything, that's what. Course 1: We started with caprese skewers - perfectly proportioned with just enough balsamic glaze to pop the flavors of the basil, cheese, and perfectly ripe pretty tomatoes. The goat cheese fig flatbread was another masterpiece of balanced flavors and texture. Course 2: The gumbo was flavorful, obviously made with a rich roux, but light enough to reasonably be a mere amuse-bouche leading up to the stars of the show. However my favorite was the arugula sunflower salad. It's bright citrusy front notes perfectly transitioned into the fresh peppery notes and cool texture of the arugula. Course 3: Wild Shrimp and Grits. Utterly swoon worthy. The alternate Herb-roasted wild mushroom pasta served with a sous-vide egg that upped the intensity of the creamy velvety delightful texture was sheer brilliance. The only reason I didn't finish mine was anticipation of Course 4: Bananas Foster Rum Cake. I swear you will never experience it's equal anywhere else. I'm still fantasizing about it a day later. 

This was truly the event of a lifetime. Every detail was thought of. They care the took to elevate my mother's birthday celebration into an elegant yet festive and intimate epic experience my family will remember forever deserves a loud round of applause. I wish I could nominate them for whatever the equivalent of an Oscar would be in their industry. 

The very last touch of the evening was discreetly  presenting me with a substantial card stock version of the personalized menu cards as my party was saying their goodbyes before dispersing home across the country. This extra touch perfectly personifies the care they poured into every detail, making what I'm sure was epic behind the scenes work seem effortless to us.",2021-12-05 16:04:27

It appears that their fraud department is highly flawed in many ways. In September 2018- I reported fraud as I got an alert for nearly $3,000 at Saks Fifth Avenue. I was supposed to receive a new credit card in the mail, but it never made it to my home. 

As I filed the report- chase took care of the transaction and removed it from my account. However, this FRAUD transaction reappeared on my bank account on November 28, 2018. I called chase and spoke to several reps. They had then accused me of actually making this transaction and said ""no offense, but then why did you ask for 2 new credit cards"". I had THEN explained that me new credit card had never been sent, so I had to cancel that one and then order a new one . ALSO another FLAW from Chase end.

With that being said- I sent a picture of my ID with my signature because they stated they found a receipt from the store with a signature on it and want to ensure that it's not my signature.

I then replied asking if they could take off the charge until they got the results on the investigation, but stated they could not. So not only did they not follow through with getting all of their evidence before RE-CHARGING my account- they had no solutions except for saying ""just don't pay it"".

ALSO, note that my credit card is due in TWO days, so I asked ""if I don't pay- will you guys cover the interest that you will charge me for not paying"". The rep stated, ""no sorry"". 

I have been a member of Chase for 10 years and I have NEVER owed any interest or have any overdue payments. My husband and I collectively have 6 accounts with Chase and will close all of them out because Chase is not customer oriented.

I hope you all close yours, too !",2018-11-30 20:01:03

As soon as we arrived, we were brought upstairs and seated close to the balcony. The lighting was gorgeous, as was the moody decor in the room. Our server Antonio greeted us promptly and was a delight!

We ask for menu recommendations, and learned that you truly could not go wrong with anything you ordered. We were told that bottomless brunch was available for $25 per person and that each person needed a meal in order to be served. That worked for us because it was exactly what we planned to do. We were brought small carafes of orange juice and cranberry juice and Antonio filled our glasses with champagne.

To eat, we shared the black truffle fries, bacon wrapped dates, crawfish beignets, and bianca flatbread. For our mains,  a friend and I shared the crab benedict and apple fritter french toast. The bacon wrapped dates were incredible, and we were able to add an additional piece to make it 4 instead of the 3 it usually comes with. Others tried the Ancient Grains Salad and the Shakshuka. Everything was a hit! 

We did not feel rushed to leave, and continued to pick at our plates while we chatted and drank our mimosas. Since our table was 6 people, there was an 18% auto-gratuity added to our check with the ability to tip on top.

The Bar in Tuna Bar is on point- I loved my first cocktail- The Picante (a mezcal drink with grapefruit and jalapeno), but the second cocktail was odd- wasabi and cucumber just tasted like someone blended a cucumber roll, and the wasabi chunks at the bottom were weird.

The Tuna in Tuna Bar is on par with Morimoto, Royal Izakaya and and Double Knot. Beware of the specials though, those prices add up! We had a 3 piece fatty tuna special for $21 and 2 piece yellowtail for $20. That's $41 for 5 pieces of fish. Coulda had 12 mediocre takeout rolls for that price, so it's hard to wrap my head around. But it was really good! They also had some fun looking fancy rolls and we tried the Fishtown Roll -with jalapeno and assorted fish wrapped around shrimp tempura which was very good.

We also enjoyed some apps and sides- the bang bang shrimp, brussel sprouts, lobster fried rice (large portion), and the wok fried crudo were all very good. Before we knew it our check was about $100 each. Not sure if there was dessert, since our waiter just brought the check and rushed us out a bit....

The place was busy on a Thursday night, despite it being in a bit of an odd location). The waiters seemed a bit stressed and the area they had to navigate was so narrow they seemed to constantly be excusing themselves or squeezing past each other. Hopefully they'll get into the groove of things as time goes on.

My party of 4 had a 6pm reservation for Saturday night. Taylor was our server and she was the bomb.com. She recognized my party had a lot of catching up to do and gave us plenty of time to decide on drinks and food without becoming impatient. 

We started with individual 8oz carafes and as the night went on, opted for the bottle of the nectar of the God's aka the Grenache Rose on the menu.  One guest in our party had a couple of Sazeracs followed by some Crying Eagle beers (he's an Eagles fan, so it fits, ha!)

We ordered shareable apps: the charcuterie board (is it a GNO if you didn't have a cheeseboard?), brussel sprouts, and duck fat fries. All yum! For dinner, my gals ordered the margherita flatbread, the burger, and I had the club sandwich. I'll embarrassingly admit that I can't recall how it was because I was *turnt* but, I'm sure it was delicious! 

Service was top notch! In addition to Taylor being our main server, we had other staff bring our food, clear plates, refill waters very promptly. 

Our bill was..well, reflective of a good time. Pro tip: try to convince yourself to start with the bottle instead of ordering individual glasses.. you'll get there eventually, and it'll probably end up saving you a few $$.

My 3 star review is due to frustration. I went yesterday with a group of people, it was the first gorgeous day so I was looking all over for places that were dog friendly so we could sit outside with our pup. On the website it says verbatim:

""Q: CAN I BRING MY DOGGO??

A: Your pup is more than welcome to join you for a pint but they'll need to stay in the outside seating area. Only service doggos are allowed inside.""

I called numerous times to double check but the phone number sends you right to a voicemail box. Regardless I figured since the website explicitly says dogs are allowed we should be okay. So we load everyone up in the car and take the 25 minute drive. When we arrive I go inside first to see how to get to the outdoor area without going through the bar because of the dog. The bouncer asks me if it's a service dog and I said ""no"" and he told me dogs aren't allowed. I explained to him what the website said and how we were just going to sit outside and he tells me ""this is a people establishment"". It was veryyyy frustrating. I understand dogs not being allowed inside and I even understand restaurants and breweries not being dog friendly, but maybe if you're NOT dog friendly, don't say on your website that you are ... anyway so I had to leave everyone there, drive my pup back home the 25 minutes then turn around and come right back.

It didn't look that way from the big sign. That was probably not true, But an associate probably just put them back on the wrong rack after emptying out the changing rooms.. I said ""OK, but that is misleading so maybe you can ask someone to move the other black ones up to the wall for the sake of other customers. ""I think this offended him because at that point he turned away and would not look up and did not respond when I said again, ""it's just kind of misleading.""  Then I was sure he was ignoring me because he wouldn't look up at us, so I said his name from his name tag and I asked if he heard me. At that point, I definitely was verging on being rude myself, but I was so shocked that he was completely ignoring me as a customer service person at the counter of a retail store that I couldn't resist asking him if he heard me. And I wasn't asking him to honor the lower price at all. Anyway, the experience was very strange, and I definitely do not want to shop there anymore because it felt very disrespectful.

They ended up needing our table though right after we had paid, and what makes this place 5 stars ++ for me is that they offered to move us to the bar and give us another round of drinks on the house for moving.

When it is full, you will usually end up sitting next to someone you've never met, which makes it great because you are all there for the same reason: BEER! and usually can start some conversation.

Now lets get to the beer. I have not had a beer there that I did not like. From the PDG to the ESB, the Kolsch and the Weizengoot, it is all great. Wednesdays are pint night, and they have euchre night on Thursdays. One of the best parts is that you can bring your dog.

I would recommend making a reservation though, especially on the weekend. Our reservation was at 8:30 and our table wasn't quite ready yet when we got there so we got a drink at the bar while we waited. Our table was ready about 15 minutes later at 8:45, but it was worth the wait because they seated us on the first level at a little booth with plush velvet, super comfortable!

Side note: do not forget your ID especially on your birthday! I'm embarrassed to say that I made this mistake (I had switched purses, it's a girl thing) so I had to run home to grab it. So it was fine that our table wasn't ready right away. And the bartender was so nice and felt bad that I had to run home he ended up buying my first drink! I believe his name was Mike, super friendly and great bartender. 

There was just two of us and we ordered 5 dishes which was the right amount of food for us. They are tapas style and made for sharing it seems. Our food also came out pretty quick. We were full by the end but not busting at the seams. They bring each dish out as they are ready instead of bringing it all out at once which I like so you're not waiting for a long time to eat. 

We started off with the wedge salad. It was skewers of lettuce with a ginger dressing on top. Fresh and tasty, although maybe a little pricey. 

Next we had the Okonomiyaki which was delicious. It was a crispy savory hashbrown type pancake with sauces and toppings on top. Highly recommend!

Then we had the Tebasaki Gyoza. Do not be fooled by the name, it is not a gyoza. It is actually a deboned chicken wing stuffed with a mixture of shrimp. There is a chili sauce for dipping. This is probably unusual for most people. The outer crust was super crispy which I loved. It had also come out super fresh and hot. A sign it was made to order and hadn't been sitting for a while. My boyfriend was so so about this dish, but I really liked it. So it depends on the person. 

After came the spicy crab noodles which had come highly recommended. It was very saucy and rich. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be although there was a good amount of crab in there. I would recommend mixing it up before you start as all of our crab and stuff had kind of settled towards the bottom. I didn't end up loving this dish as I had thought I would. The flavors were a bit muddled and maybe a little too rich for me. 

Lastly, we had the ikinari steak. It's American skirt steak on a bed of sweet corn and onions with a generous scoop of the miso butter. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and came out on a sizzling skillet. So for those who don't like their meet too rare, it does continue to cook a bit after it comes out. The steak was super tender and had a sauce on top. For me it could have had a little less sauce so the steak could shine, but still delicious nevertheless. It was a little difficult to eat the corn with chopsticks though haha. I could have asked for other utensils, but I didn't want to be ""that person.""

Overall it was a great experience. The decor instead was beautiful, with a mix of mid century furniture and more luxurious touches like the velvet booths. Everyone we encountered was friendly and our server was great, very knowledgeable and nice. Would definitely come back to try the other dishes.",2019-07-20 17:42:35

The prices are even in line with what you should expect from the Fridays/O.G. Big difference is here they give you crayons so you can doodle on the table while you wait on the next round. I don't doodle. I take colouring very seriously. Don't seat me without a minimum of five colours. Joking of course; I bring my own.

The wait staff is friendly and very efficient. They should crayon their name upside down on your butcher paper. If not, ask them to. It's different and fun.

The wine selection appears to be pretty decent, but I'm not really a wine guy. They see me coming and immediately pull the alcohol glasses from the table. They have a killer ice tea, however!

One disadvantage of aging is limited income. It makes dining out a challenge. The Macaroni Grill folks send us email coupons twice a week. Many times a BOGO. It's a great way to try different dishes and not pay full price. 

Personally, I think they have an exceptional Chicken Parm. The Spaghetti is great, too. The meatballs are a bit spicy so I don't order it very often. I absolutely refuse to come here and not split the Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Mrs. E. I think they add some secret concoction to make you crave them. A-D-D-I-C-T-I-N-G!!!!!! 

It's Italian and that means you're paying more. But they provide a gorgeous atmosphere and very hospitable people. John is one of the best and of course Troy, the big dawg whose name is on the door, is happy to meet you, anytime. 11/19",2019-11-27 04:44:12

I recently spent a long weekend in Santa Barbara with my family and close friends that are renting a house in the area for the month.  Helena Avenue Bakery was the first place we went upon arrival and the last place we visited before our drive back, and I think we stopped by once or twice in between as well.

Some of my favorite menu items from all of those visits:
-Avocado Toast
-Turkey Sandwich
-Kale Caesar Salad
-Homemade Potato Chips
-Hummus and BabaGhanoush

We also purchased some fresh sourdough and country seed bread loaves to-go.  (They will slice it if you ask as long as it's not so early that it's too warm out of the oven to do so).  My kids had their donuts but didn't love them... I think they looked better than they tasted.  I also had a fabulous Americano with almond milk.

Shout-out to Lauren who didn't lose her cool as my husband and I visited first thing on a Sunday before our drive back home and kept adding on to our order.  First it was just coffee and bread, then we decided we needed a sandwich and salad for the road, then we ordered donuts, chips, hummus, etc... Thanks Lauren!

I also opted for the egg to be scrambled instead of poached. My friend order the fried chicken sandwich, the slaw really brought out the flavor in the sandwich.",2021-10-25 23:06:35

This place is a very small restaurant with very limited menus, but as an one-time customer, there were definitely enough choices to choose from. I got the vegetable bibimbap. The food came very quickly and even though at first glance, it looked very little, it was actually quite filling. There was a good ratio of vegetable to rice and the sauce was definitely a good kick of flavour. The staff was very nice. 

The only downside was that it was pretty expensive for just one bowl of rice. I know it was a bit cheaper than other places that serve bibimbap by around ~$1-2 but there were no side dishes served at this place, which I thought made the price not as worth it even if it was cheaper by a bit.

It was 6pm we were on the early side they weren't slammed yet.  Appetizers took forever. Crawfish beignet were fine a little stringy, considerable filler.  The carrots were fine too. Black truffle fries were crap.  Heavily doubt that the fires were made in house.  It would legitimately would have been better to doordash fries from McDonalds or Wendys to get a better quality fry with ""truffle"" oil on them.  

We got three salads that were fine, but WHY o WHY did they think it was OK to drop the entree's on the table about 90 seconds after the salads arrived.  That is a cardinal sin of table serving. Stacking freshly prepared food in front of a diner and forcing them to choose: 1) let something get stale or cold, 2) make a fuss and ask them to take it back (it's just going to sit under a heat lamp) if you make them cook it fresh, then wait 30 minutes while the rest of your party eats uncomfortably.  TWO of us had salads before our entree and be both had hot food crowding out or place setting with a full salad sitting in front of us. 

The Gulf Fish Almondine was truly weird and worse for it.  Fish almondine should be cooked in a pan with a butter sauce -- or broiled or baked -- with a garnish of almonds.  I understand artistic riffs on this that can still be excellent.  But if you promote yourself as a seafood town because you're next to the ocean, why would you create a fish almondine that has a HARD, THICK batter that totally overpowers a delicate protein like fish?  It made no sense and the crust really took away from a nice piece of fish.  It says ""champagne cream sauce""  Delicate, right?  NOWHERE on the menu does it say that this dish with a classic name was not going to be prepared classically and have an unacceptably thick breading on it.  

honestly, if they hadn't rushed the entrees on top of the salad or at LEAST apologized, I would have gone another star.  But we did everything right -- made a rez, waited patiently when things were slow, didn't raise hell with awful service errors -- and they did too many things wrong.",2021-11-20 14:54:09

Ordered the green eggs and ham and it was actually quite filling. The square egg was fluffy and soft. Brioche bun was delicious and has a slight crisp which I loved.

The nice surprise was actually the sourdough bread with olive. It was about $10 (or $12 I can't remember). It's actually sour but not to the point that you get a bitter aftertaste. It's so clearly hand-made since the air bubbles inside are uneven. The bread has a nice crisp on the outside and it's very soft on the inside. Also quite chewy!

Breakfast is built into your room rate and the spread could feed a football high school team. We also meet fellow Hawaii travelers at breakfast, what a small world! We really liked the 24 hour coffee and tea station in the lobby however there seems to be some kind of competition with the trash among employees to see of how long it can sit out and how many pieces of trash can pileup on top of it without toppling over.

My only complaint about the property was that the pool and hot tub area could use some cleaning love and the weight room scale was very broken, unless I lost 43 lbs...yeah I found my justification to EAT more!!

This restaurant, like much of St. Louis is going for a classic elegance. Unfortunately, this place falls far short and is extremely average. Everything from the decorations (imagine faux finish walls that change colors every 5 feet, perhaps trying to mimic the colorful facades of an Italian village but really just invoking a circus tent) to the humdrum (and very pricey) wine list shoots for the stars but like the Challenger barely makes it into the stratosphere. In fact I might go so far as to say if you're looking for Italian you'd be better served at the Olive Garden, where they at least offer fresh ground pepper or cheese for your entrees and salads.

My meal was plain Jane. I was looking for something light and healthy. Almost everything on the menu was advertised as served under a beure blanc sauce or a cream based sauce. Therefore I chose a seafood pasta with tomato sauce. Expecting some hearty prawns and delicious fresh vegetables, instead I got a mash of overcooked spaghetti with pasty sauce that tasted like a reduction of Chef Boyardee. My boyfriend had the house special, a $25 risotto that tasted like Uncle Ben's, but worse. 

Thankfully, the evening was not a complete waste as I boxed up my spaghetti, brought it home, added some wine, vegetables and fresh parmesan cheese substantially improving the meal.

We had Purchased the gift card for Costco so it's like having a 20% discount. Macaroni Grill is a bit expensive, however the food quality has a high standard. 

When we arrived, it was kind of strange because the place was deserted. The waitress/hostess that greeted us was very friendly and sat us immediately. She was friendly and professional. The only concern I have is that she wore an extreme amount of perfume. It made me gag when she came by the table to ask us for drinks. Also, when she brought the bread and olive oil, the bottom of the bread was rockhard. The top was soft however we could not cut through the bottom without a saw. Our server care of this immediately. It was kind of hard to taste the bread with the perfume wafting around us. 

The price has definitely increased as the bottle of wine was quoted at $48. I remember just before Covid being here and the bottle is $32. So I asked for a wine list. She said they did not have one but she knew everything about the wines. Luckily I had an old picture of the wine menu and showed it to her. She went to check the prices and then quoted me $38 for a bottle and apologized. It is somewhat difficult to not have the ability to look at the list of wines and their prices. Especially when you were quoted $16 more than the last time you visited.

What we ordered:

Drinks: went with a bottle of wine. My wife likes sweeter wines so I ordered a bottle of Reisling (Chateau St. Michelle) 

Lamb Shank 
Steak and mash
Grilled asparagus 

The food is extremely good. The lamb shank pulled apart with a fork. The steak was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. My wife really loved the style of mashed potatoes. For a side of asparagus, it seemed a bit small. But it was definitely cooked nicely.

I do hope the waitress reads this review and adjust her perfume. With a sidenote, if you wear the same perfume over and over, sometimes you get desensitized to the smell and you have to apply more so you can smell it. Overtime this builds up and the result is suffocating for others.

Also when we were finally able to order we were told that after waiting 30 minutes in line we had to take our food to go because there weren't any tables available we pointed out that some of the tables were leaving shortly  and they told us that we could not have those tables and the people behind us had priority over those tables.

I would give 0 stars if that were an option but alas it isn't.

The red velvet ice cream was tasty but I'm over red velvet-flavored stuff generally. It's a subtle flavor in its original cake form so I don't know why I'd expect it to jump out or taste better in denser mediums like ice cream. Try something else, even if you're from above the Mason Dixon line and feel obligated to try anything with ""red velvet"" in the name. I hear that can take you to dark, dark places...

I'm going to be contrary now and state that nothing red velvet-flavored is all that special except for red velvet cake. 

The texture of the ice cream was quite good. I got two scoops on a chocolate chip cone, which actually seems to be a rolled, dense cookie instead of a traditional ice cream cone. Cool.

I'm going to be contrary AGAIN and state that I was hoping the chocolate chip cone would be a traditional waffle cone with chocolate chips. How awesome would that be?

I appreciated that the cookie cone remained structurally intact. They'd put a plastic guard around the cone to keep melted ice cream for getting all over your hands. It seems that they'd factored in that Mike's is a heavy tourist draw and that people would be walking around while eating their ice cream.

I'm going to be contrary AGAIN and AGAIN and say that I appreciated all the tourist-driven innovations but Mike's was not worth $6 for a two-scoop ice cream cone. It felt a bit like extortion, especially when phenomenal places in NYC, SF and Boston charge less for three scoops. I typically abandon my sense of value when it comes to ice cream and I still felt offended.

The pricing would not stop me from coming back to Mike's on subsequent trips to Nashvegas. It's quite good and so conveniently located that it's hard for me to say no. Mike's is great for that very specific ice cream craving that comes when you're indulging in tourism in a party atmosphere in a hot city. It more than does the trick and far exceeds the quality of most places that exist to satisfy that need. If you're looking for real quality though, I hear it's best to wait for Jeni's.",2014-05-08 19:56:11

Do book a reservation. We were glad to have one as the restaurant filled up completely within a half hour of our arrival. Servers seemed to be a little stressed and we had to flag our server down a couple times when we needed something after our initial order.

I typically stick with wine or vodka martinis when I have sushi, but after tasting my friend's cocktail I ordered the same. It was a mezcal drink with lime and jalapeño syrup that was absolutely delicious. My friend later ordered a gin martini with wasabi - the taste was really fresh and interesting but the wasabi wasn't mixed in well and she encountered a few larger nuggets which made the drink a little weird. 

We ordered several plates and highlights for me were the lobster fried rice, crispy rock shrimp, fishtown roll and one of the specials of the day, some fresh yellowtail, which was absolutely incredible. 

If there is dessert on the menu, we wouldn't know, because our check was dropped without us even asking for it. Not exactly the warm vibe I'm expecting when spending upwards of $100/person.

When I say early dinner, I'm talking 5pm which means we made it just in time for happy hour. Their happy hour deals include wines, one of their signature cocktails (I believe it was a whiskey cocktail on the day that we went) and a select few bites. Although we passed on their drink specials, we did order their $6 dumplings and a spicy salmon roll. As for drinks, we both ordered off of the cocktail list. She got the Shiso Picate which comes with mezcal and jalapeño and I got the Winston's Heat with gin, wasabi and cucumber. We both loved our drinks - so much so that we were happy to get a second round!

3 adults

Atmosphere - NA stars
Food - 5 star
Service - 5 star

Background - I have been following this truck for a while via Facebook.  So when he said that he was going to be at the Riverfest and that I had already this event in my plans I was excited.

Atmosphere - I am not rating this as it is food truck, but a very cool one.  

Food
  Drink - First round we all tried the lemon lime margarita.  This was an excellent choice.  The second I tried the strawberry mango margarita.  I enjoyed the strawberry mango but the ladies tried mine and both agreed it was a little too sweet for them.  Third and fourth rounds they only had the lemon lime.  I think they could add an option to the menu of an additional shot of tequila to your margarita.

Service - The owner and father were super friendly.  Bonus they had a card swipe you can use your credit card.

Future - I went there four times this day, so yes I would go back.",2019-05-12 19:22:33

Sure, I've heard of Bier Brewery before and I have had their beer at other places, but this was my first trip to the brewery.

Sits on the corner of a strip mall with limited outdoor seating out front. Lots of places to sit inside though, including some big tables, small high top tables, and a bar in the back corner. Very relaxing and casual and stuff stuffed above the restrooms and in every nook and cranny. 

Specials most evenings. I arrived during their growler fill special, although I just stuck with a couple of pints. They were advertising their pumpkin release while I was there, so I'll have to stop back in for that.

The person who took the payment assured her (after she specifically asked) that this would not affect her credit score! that she should not worry... well... my wife's credit score (which was 835!!!) went down to 740!!!! Yes, it is still a good score, but she didn't get to that score by not paying on time, or not paying at all... she has worked VERY HARD to get to where she is (WAS) on her credit rating, and I think it is very UNFAIR that she was penalized so much for such a minute overlook. So after finding out her new credit score, she called Chase! and was told by the customer service rep. that there was nothing he could do... when she asked to speak to a manager... he said (in a jokingly tone) that ""she won't be able to do anything about it either""
I have advice her to pay that balance off with them, and/or transfer the very small balance to another card... and NEVER use Chase credit cards or deal with Chase bank!

Last month I discovered the secondary credit card attached to ""my"" Chase credit account (issued in my grandson's name) was ""missing"" after the child's wallet was confiscated (later returned) by the Encinitas sheriff's department following a still pending dispute. Upon discovery of the missing card I immediately called Chase and ""cancelled"" the old card and was told (per website instruction) to notify ALL existing merchants if the billing information were to remain the same. (New account number issued/balance forwarded but old account closed for ""security"" reasons. Simple enough, you would think? But apparently this is not the case.)

When reviewing my Chase account on 12/12/2017, I noticed a new charge for $39.99 (posted by LA fitness--my grandson had signed up for reoccurring billing prior to the credit card account being closed and balance reassigned) prompting me to file a single charge dispute. Two days later, another charge by LA Fitness (Encinitas location) ($19.98 also not authorized) was posted to which I called to file a second dispute. 

When I called Chase I was put in touch with the institution's fraud department (both calls routed through India call center) and was told the charges were related to the previous account (even though the account had been deactivated, closed and reassigned) and were therefore ""authorized""! (What?! And by Whom?) When I explained that no new information to authorize billing had been forwarded to LA Fitness and that the new charges reflected since new account issuance had been reassigned were not authorized the representative could not understand! 

Ten minutes later I called Chase back (800-945-2000 ext. ""0"") and asked for the newly assigned account to be placed on a temporary hold until the matter could be resolved. I reemphasized my reasons for WHY I was disputing both charges and informed the India consultants that I would be doing so in writing once Chase forwards the paperwork to explain why.  Pending HOW Chase handles this dispute will determine what action I follow up with, which could include taking this matter to federal court! (Since it's the banking industry and because it affects the general population it's seems fitting at this point.)

While I'm waiting for a response from Chase anybody have any suggestions as to why Chase - or any credit card company for that matter - would take on other businesses contractual obligations and without both parties first consenting let alone being informed ? Is that even allowed?  F.Y.I. Amazon won't do it - their call center is also based out of India - so why would the banking industry take such a risk?

Check back..... I'll post updates or modify or change the 1 star review as events unfold....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 12/19/2017..... Called JP Morgan-Chase Bank USA N.A. fraud department yesterday and the problem was ""instantly"" resolved. The man on the phone pulled my account (with my permission) and immediately understood and transferred me to someone to reverse the unauthorized charges. They put a block on LA Fitness vendor and made sure my accounts were safe and not subject to future charges.

Should you ever encounter difficulties or not be able to resolve a problem from Chase's India based customer service location I suggest calling the USA number (1-800 -432-3117).

Thank you gentleman working in Chase's Fraud department, I appreciate you looking out for my best interests!

I ordered a large fries and an order of clam strips.  Their fries are usually so amazing that I won't pass them up.  Crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle.  They are french fry heaven.  I'd been thinking of branching out and trying something different, so I ordered the clam strips which were on the appetizer menu.

When I placed the order, the man at the counter asked me if they were the appetizers and I said yes.  He told me he'd ring it up as a platter and that would save me a little money.

And THAT was my mistake.  I should have said, ""no thanks,"" because that platter didn't save me any money at all.

I live a short 5 min from the store.  When I got home, I opened the container to find the fries sitting on top of a salad.  Let's forget that I didn't order salad.  Salads are cold.  French fries are hot.  Dumping hot fries on a cold salad does what to those two foods?  It turns the salad into slimy, limp, warm slop.  It also made their normally crispy fries WET and limp.

As if that weren't bad enough, the clam strips weren't strips. They looked like overcooked little balls and they were all over the fries and the salad.  All of this was in a styrofoam container that was all wet inside from the steam build up.

That entire box was $9.25 + tax of inedible crap and went right in the trash.  

Fine.  Lesson learned.  Next time I want fries, I'll order from the appetizer menu.  And I'll pass on the clam ""strips"" and stick with the two items I know are fantastic: the cheesesteaks and the burgers.

(For the record, I'm not new to ""platters.""  What's different here is the fact that the cold salad was in with hot food. Platters I've ordered elsewhere include salads in their own containers. This is restaurant basics 101:  serve the cold food cold and the hot food hot.)",2018-07-14 03:01:51

I'd originally planned to go to one of the newer spots but I've been here many times and knew they wouldn't disappoint me. I wish the rest of the city was like Chinatown that place is always jumping it feels like NYC. 

Service 4.5/5
The counter lady was all business but the two people in front of me were elderly and I thought she could have been a little gentler with their cake box. I'd a feeling there was an actual cake inside and the man commented to me that ""this is a peaceful place,"" right before she slammed his cake box on the counter. Now he epitomized customer loyalty but I could see (though he didn't say it) he didn't feel appreciated by the counter lady. A loyal customer is special and should be treated accordingly. 

Ambiance 3/5
I've been here before it's not peaceful. But I enjoyed the people watching. There are usually senior citizens sitting together watching the news in Chinese with a cup of coffee or tea it's lovely to see them. And even better b/c the scent of coffee wafting through the cafe/bakery smelled divine. I didn't order it though b/c I'm a habitual insomniac so no caffeine for me after 2pm.

Food
Egg tart 3/5
Though it was delicious it was way too sweet for me and i love sweets. The tart crust was perfect but the egg custard was too sweet. I won't order it again although it was very creamy and otherwise cooked perfectly.

Rainbow cake 5/5
Not too sweet - it was perfect and just the right amount of frosting. The sponge cake was moist and had the right texture. I basically have the pallet of a little kid so if i see rainbow sprinkles i say yes please.

I wound up getting the burger and fries combo which is always pretty good here. Mind you I just said I wasn't that hungry and barely finished my food. My wife ordered the sauteed mushroom melt and hers was so big, we could have split that instead. 

Overall, I will definitely just stick to Thursday mostly because as much as I love the kids play area, I could see my daughter was overwhelmed by the amount of kids and didn't have as much fun which is half the reason we come, but that's nothing the business can control.

uB1jgqWzKygs-OVaaVRtag,hzEHbzC49hFmFIZxMY47JQ,tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg,4.0,7,0,4,"TGP has two stand-out features: Ambience (Read date night!) and rare ingredients. 

Compared to other haute cuisine restaurants, there are few of this grandeur. It is mid-century, dimly lit, with grand emerald green velvet seats and walls of the same color. It's going to give date night spots in town a run for the money. The vibe is upscale with house lounge music (loud and could be toned down). Plus, the serving ware is gorgeous. The dish added to the beauty of the dish. (I dunno how I felt about wooden chopsticks, though. It's definitely more practical, but did take away from the elegance). So just for the ambience TGP deserves more than 5 stars. 

TGP has a well curated menu. There is plenty to choose from, although vegetarian options maybe limited. They use fine quality ingredients like Jidori chicken, and mushrooms too fancy to google (kidding!). Also, there isn't sushi, ramen or yakitori for dinner. The portions are small, sharing size, but given Japanese cuisine is all about clean light and bright flavors, those elements alone will satisfy your appetite. The menu is divided into Cold and Hot; within the hot, light to heavy dishes.

The Sunomono: To dumb it down-fancy poke. To elevate it- fresh, cooling, and edible flowers. The moonfish is gorgeous and the coolness from the cucumber ironically punches through. 

Tebasaki gyoza: You haven't had chicken wings like this before. The inside is filled with shrimp. I don't know where the croissant is, in the filling or the crumb coat, but either way, stuffed wing like no other. Delicious, light, juicy and crunchy with an element of surprise. The sweet chile sauce seemed like the regular kind, I couldn't tell if it was house-made. 

Ikinari steak: Don't let the size fool you. It is rich and a very heavy dish. Comes out in a sizzling skillet. A huge dollop of miso brown butter, looks like gold and feels as rich, makes the steak outstanding. The skirt steak is cooked to perfection-  medium rare, tender juicy and a delicious char and asian flavor. The caramelized onions and corn really compliment the richness from the butter and sauce. Great fusion. 

Fried Tempura Chocolate Cake: I am not a big fan of the chewiness in mochi, so I went with the extreme opposite: texture bomb! This is a molten chocolate cake fried in tempura batter with dulce de leche sauce, with a side of ice cream, topped with sauteed puffed rice. So you have the ooey goeey, the crispy, crunchy, hot cold, solid and liquid.  Decadent, much? Most definitely. 
In spite of the multiple textures, it felt one note- very sweet. I wish they had some salt or citrus to cut the richness. 

Granted, I have not had enough Japanese food of this kind to compare so I may not be the best judge. I think the food is delicious and of high quality, but I just wasn't wowed by the flavors. It was an elevation of the quality and ingredients of the familiar asian flavors.

They have midday and lunch offerings too which would be great to try out. Prices are comparable, portions depending on the item maybe on the smaller side. 

The service is great. We actually went with the recommendations of our host who told us about the dishes. There is ample seating. 

The reason I was a little annoyed, I picked the wrong premier parking garage downtown (222 parking is the closest to TGP) and by the time I walked over to catch the midday menu, with ten minutes to spare till dinner at 5pm I couldn't order off it. So although the midday is till 5 it isn't. But I agree that's me being pesky. 

Nonetheless, next time. TGP is a great addition to downtown. The upscale Japanese food makes it very unique. And it is a very promising restaurant.",2018-11-21 19:59:46

This place is still fairly new, and right now, it's being talked about by a lot! My friends and I wanted to try this spot during the Mardi Gras week and see what it's all about. 

The place looks great! Just right on Poydras, this place has a pretty fair selection of wines to try and food and snacks to munch on! The place inside was packed, and for some reason, their upstairs rooms were not open that day, so we had to sit outside during the night. It was fairly cold, and disappointingly, there were no lights outside and no heaters. However, the outside looked great and the soft chairs were pretty comfortable to sit on and relax. A lot of us ordered different wines and mixed drinks. We also ordered Herb Roasted mushroom pasta, Short rib, Wagyu Burger, Duck Fat Fries, 3 Pork Bellies, and a Smoked Salmon. 

First off, I could appreciate the selection of wines they had to offer, not bad at all. They also had a ""Flight"" option where you can try a small amount of 3 different wines. What shocked me was that these wines were sort of expensive. The server that brought out the ""Flights"" for my friends got a lot of the wines mixed up and was confused on who ordered what, sort of disappointing. As for the food, most of it was pretty lackluster, but not bad. The Duck Fat fries were $8 and it was nothing more but fries with a little cheese on top. EASY pass. We ordered 3 orders of the Pork Belly, but the dishes were inconsistent. My dish in particular was surrounded by a sauce while the other 2 didn't. I didn't know what the dish was supposed to look like. The Pasta was overcooked and lacked some flavour. The short ribs were nothing more that just shirt ribs to be honest. Lacking in flavour and just pretty underwhelming. If the burger did not have the Wagyu name in it, I would've just thought it was a regular burger, which it pretty much is, again, underwhelming. And finally.. that SALMON was $16!! The salmon was TINY and it came with about 5 pieces of small toast to share. Again, pretty standard, yet , EXPENSIVE.

Overall, this place isn't bad if you wanna come has some wines and snacks to eat and have some cheese plates, however, you're gonna spend a good bit. Nothing impressive for my first trip, I don't think this place would come across my mind again unless someone suggested.",2019-03-12 04:45:02

Upon leaving, I remembered that this spot was within a block of the pier. After hearing several of my friends rave about this place, I figured now was as good a time as any to give 'em a try!

It was just past 7am when I walked in. There was one couple seated, but the kitchen was teeming with staff baking away! What a cool sight! The restaurant appears to be shared with a winery; the venue was spacious and well-decorated! Though there only appeared to be a few dedicated parking spaces, I had no trouble finding a spot close by. 

The staff were friendly and the menu was vast. I ordered a mocha and the ricotta toast and they were both out of this world. The mocha was one of the best I've ever had, and the toast had the perfect blend of sweet and savory  atop a hearty slab of bread! They went together so well. What a treat!

Today was my first time here but certainly not my last. I've attempted to come in the past only to be greeted by a line out the door. As I was leaving, a group of 10 walked in. The place is totally worth the line, but be like me and come super early to avoid it!",2020-01-19 00:42:28

I had been here one other time, on a weekday afternoon, and I was the only person there. But my experience overall was consistent with my more recent visit.

Bier has been around a while. It started out pretty small and was basically available just on tap at a few restaurants around Indy and at their tasting room, which had very limited hours. Their having decided to can and distribute their beer has probably really helped, and they've slowly gotten a little bit bigger over time. 

I like their beer. I've never tasted anything by them that knocked my socks off, but their quality control is very good and they do a few creative things, especially now with the hazy IPA craze. But their stalwart staples such as Weizengoot (a hefeweizen that is my favorite of their beers) are very strong.

The taproom itself has a roped off area out front with some seating, and there's more seating inside, all tables socially distanced. There is a small counter area where you order. They have maybe 10 beers on tap at any one time, all theirs as far as I saw. They also have a carryout fridge. The folks at the counter were super friendly and wore masks at all times, particularly when cleaning tables between customers.

The taproom does not serve food but they welcome you to bring your own. I'm not sure about pets, as I didn't see any there. I'd imagine they'd at least be welcome on the patio area out front, weather permitting.

In the end, Bier is probably not going to be a splashy name in town like Sun King is and isn't going to demand that kind of attention. But their beer is quite good, and I think if they had more resources (or ambition? I don't think it's fair to judge on something I don't know for sure. Some craft breweries actually don't want to be big and notorious and prefer to stay smaller) they'd be one of the heavies in the state as far as the top breweries go.",2020-11-18 18:33:40

Come to find out they where made with Buffalo milk. Main course was Doc's Signature Burger, nothing out of the ordinary just a delicious burger with fries . My girl friend went with there Steamed P.E.I. Mussels. From what she said they where delicious except for the occasional grains of sand! 
All in all a great restaurant, does start to get loud and over crowded after 9:30 but that's like most places in down town West Chester.",2010-09-24 14:29:43

These chain restaurants must all have the same consulting company because they all have the same routine going on.  Elaborate theme oriented exterior that tries to be ""fun"", brightly colored laminated menus, ridiculous themed interiors, nearly identical websites, signature appetizers, and terrible food.  

Jimmy Buffet's foray (cash  grab) into the restaurant racket boasts cheeseburgers.  They are not bad, but in the end the industrial nature of the restaurant cancels out the positives.  My burger was juicy and cooked as I requested but did not come with what the menu said it would come with: jalapenos, sour cream, and pepper jack cheese.  Instead I received some sort of chemically altered dairy slab, No sour cream, and pickles.  

The food was just not discussion worthy.  

Our server must  have been playing hide  and seek.  Annoying.

The interior is pathetic for all but individuals below the age of 20.  The bar has a fake straw roof to give the impression you are on the beach.  Only you never feel like you are on the beach.

Essentially no where legally for us to park to wait for the valet.

He snaps at us he's swamped and that we need to legally park and to pay a $12 fee for the valet before he can help us. I understand he is working alone on a Saturday night but the attitude was unnecessary. We ended up parking in a garage right down the street and The green pheasant validated it, I feel for the guy but he could have been more pleasant and apologetic. Two people working the stand could probably solve the problem. Then when I arrive my friends I'm meeting are waiting at the bar explained we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. They'd been waiting at least ten minutes bc of the valet situation and we let the hostess know we are all there and she forgot about us.

I tend to be drawn to the more unusual ones that you don't most other places.  Some flavors are better than others, but really I think that's a personal preference issue.  So far my favorite is the banana pudding ice cream that I had maybe a year ago.  Yesterday I opted for the key lime pie based on the Yelp reviews, and while it was ok, it wasn't anywhere near my favorite.  I walked away thinking I should have tried the red velvet.  But, that's the risk you take unless you continually order the same flavor.  And, with so many options, where's the fun in that?  

I would echo other reviews and say to stick with the ""square ice cream bins"" as those are the homemade ones.",2011-08-03 19:12:22

Tremendous wine list by the glass with draft wine at the ideal temperature for red or white. The bartender was full of great suggestions and led me to a fantastic Cabernet blend by Italics and a surprisingly smooth and drinkable Petit Syrah. 

Definitely set up to promote conversation with large tall top tables and a comfortable bar area complete  lots of lush plants to make it feel more intimate. Appropriate lighting and volume level to ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION AND NOT BE ON YOUR PHONE ALL NIGHT. Imagine that ;)

The food was reasonably priced and pretty tasty and actually came out quickly (even though they warned us of long ticket times in advance due to a computer glitch). We got the goat cheese and fig flat bread and the deviled eggs along with the tomato soup. The tomato soup was by far my favorite - acidic with just a hint of creaminess to even it out and a ton of garlic. With a slab of bread, it would have been heaven on a slightly chilly night. The deviled eggs had great mustardy flavor, but not the best value on the menu for $8 for 3 - there was supposed to be some crab as well but it was pretty minimal. The flatbread was tasty as well - nice thin yeasty crust with a bunch of goat cheese and a fig drizzle but I would have liked a little bit more accoutrement on top (Maybe some veg, arugula, fig pieces?) even though I enjoyed every last bite.

Check Copper Vine out for lots of good wine and some delightful snacks!",2019-12-17 04:10:59

I also ordered ""honey citron tea"" which the sign said $1.25, then the lady charged me $1.50. I positively thought they must have changed the price.

My girlfriend asked the server she didn't know what to get between the a coffee milkshake or a frozen cappuccino and then suggested she order an espresso milkshake and you could pick any ice cream flavor you wanted. He throw out a few suggestions and my girlfriend decided on the mint chip. The result was a perfect blend of both worlds that was perfectly balanced with the undertone of cappuccino and yet a refreshing hit of mint.

We inherited major oven issues missed by the inspector in our new home and it wouldn't heat up.

We were so overwhelmed with issues during that first month and I was so frazzled Terry was such a blessing, his calm demeanor and the way he explained everything made it all seem tolerable.  
He spent over an hour and totally took our range apart to try to find the issue and discovered the faulty thermostat.  Our drawer dishwasher was not working either, and he helped us to realize that it was just so filthy from the previous owners and just cleaning under the bottom plate would most likely take care of it (and this was the case) 
The thermostat came in promptly and he was able to repair our range so we could use it,we were so grateful.  Now, here's what drives it home.  We were having issues with getting reimbursement from our Home Warranty company (I know BIG SURPRISE) I had just given up.

I'm not ashamed to say that we needed to be schooled on how to read the menu and placing our order. Alex was a pro and recommend the ""crowd pleasers"" as well as his favorites and reasons why. He also asked us to pick two to three things at a time because as soon as the chef prepares each dish, it is brought to the table immediately. Thus, this was the pattern we created. Order eat, order eat, repeat. 

First up was the wedge salad with ginger dressing, fried oysters and the broccolini with bite sized shrimp. Just as we finished these scrumptious plates, we proceed with our next order of spicy crab noodles (be prepared to have a new addiction) and lobster dumplings. As our fork touched the desert plate on the last bite of a caramelized ginger creme brulee, we had come to realize that we experienced something truly special on a simple Tuesday night.

It took forever to get salads out to our table. I had to ask for fresh ground pepper and parmesan cheese.  I asked for a second salad it took 20 minutes to get a salad? The waitress said they were behind. 

The cheese was not even fresh grated, she brought a plastic container out with cheese that looked like it was pre packaged.  The waitress said I guess this is how we are doing it.  They used to grate fresh Parmesan cheese for your meal.

We thought there was table service, but immediately saw about a dozen signs saying otherwise. The next thing we noticed was the size of this place. It is HUGE! You could easily have a wedding here. 

After looking around for a minute, we noticed the kids play area, which is mostly why we decided to come here. Upon further investigation, we realized it was more suited for older kids, but it was still a good mix of things. Climbing structures, slides, a pirate ship, games and swings. 

We walked over to the bar and ordered some food. I got the BBQ wings and a cheeseburger, the wife got a tuna melt and we got the kiddo a burger. We walked around the play area a bit while we waited, and in probably 15 min or so, the food was already at our table. 

I'm jumping right into the food here because we all know that's the most important part. The wings were good. Really good. Super crispy, hot and with just a little sauce, the way I love them. The French fries that came with the kid's burger were also hot and crispy with just enough salt. If we had just gotten those 2 things, this place would have been an easy 5 stars, but that was not the case. 

The burgers were very well done, thin, unseasoned and were most definitely frozen prior to our arrival. Sorry, but throwing on a bunch of lettuce, a LOT of mayo and 5 pickles, PLUS a pickle on the side, does not mask the taste of a hockey puck. Also, the pickles are bread and butter pickles I believe. No one likes those. My wife, who loves pickles, actually spit hers out. Later after we had finished eating, I also saw a man at another table spit a chunk of his pickle out as well. It was a sad day for pickles. 

The tuna melt, which my wife barely touched was not great either. The tuna, even though it was flavorful, was cold, the bread was soggy and someone just threw on a piece of cheese, put the whole thing under the broiler for a second and by the time it reached the table, the cheese was already room temperature. There was also a lot of relish on top of the whole thing, which made it prettier, but didn't help overall. 

This place is good for a quick bite with kids in tow. I would not recommend coming here if you're looking for a nice dinner. Have a beer, have some fried food, let the kids run around and you'll be more than satisfied.",2020-02-06 00:46:11

The soup surprised me. It had a nice amount of cheese along with good flavor in the broth. My expectations suddenly were raised. 

The sandwich was huge. It was overloaded with chicken and cheese and had a great Cajun bite to it. Most importantly it was juicy. Grilled chicken sandwiches often dry out. This one was perfect.

(A cautionary tale and why staying local is key)

Sorry if this is a little long winded but I have to give high praise to Tina Burney of Premier Mortgage Resources here in the Treasure Valley. I don't write reviews on goods or services unless they are really bad or really good. And now The Rest of the Story....

I decided I wanted to go from a 30 yr fixed to a 15 yr fixed and pull some cash out. Having been a mortgage loan officer and California real estate licensee for 20 years, I know the business. And because of that I know that my situation with my  finances, credit, stability, etc is what we used to refer to when I was in the business as a ""slam dunk"" deal.  I decided to contact my current mortgage holder, Freedom Mortgage for this need because I had been with them for over 5 years. What a mistake that was! Long story short, Freedom Mortgage company was inept, unprofessional and non-communicative. After 3 months of playing with this company, I ended up e-mail blasting 15 top level executives to include the CEO to try to get some action. They still could not pull it together!

A friend of mine told me his son had just had a great experience with Tina Burney at Premier Mortgage Resources so I called her. After talking with her, I decided to pull my application from Freedom and to reapply with Tina. I found her very professional, knowledgeable and fast! On May 6th she took my application. On May 8th she had an approval pending the title report. We signed our docs on May 22nd and the deal was funded, recorded and wire transfer in the bank was complete on May 28th. So what Freedom Mortgage couldn't get done in over 3 months, Tina Burney got done in 22 days start to finish! 

Bottom line is this. If you want your loan process to go smooth and fast, go to Tina. And no I do not get any kickbacks for this! She is just that good!",2020-06-01 16:40:29

I used to think understaffed businesses just had owners who were being cheap, but in the COVID era who knows.

I might have thought that my flavor choices of chocolate raspberry truffle and mint white chocolate oreo were unique, but I was bemused to read someone else's review where they ordered the same combination. These must be winning flavors. I actually liked the truffle even better than my mint chip but both were abundant in complexity. It was a mild winter day, but I did consider their large selection of specialty hot chocolates as well. They didn't seem to have much in the way of non-dairy frozen desserts, but their beverage selection offered multiple alternative milks so at least there's something if you need. I guess because they're open late downtown they see themselves as a bit of a convenience store as they had Tylenol and a few other random things for sale at the register.

It wasn't quite so good that I would rule out ever trying another dessert in Nashville, but their flavor selection is more than the basics and it is good.",2022-01-15 03:27:53
