But there are a couple of important cons for me. Biggest being, the music is constant and too loud, ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do: read, work, reflect, or enjoy a good conversation. When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.

Secondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.

Pros: gluten free goodies and yummy Italian sodas. I'd love to spend more time here, but the music usually drives me out after 10 minutes.",2012-11-06 23:35:15

I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself, brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. 

The next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. 

The service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol",2015-11-19 03:51:39

Atmosphere-
This restaurant seems to be disjointed. I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.
Service-
Our waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. 
Food- 
I loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!

I might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable. Maybe we will give it another try, because I really want to like this place!",2012-04-28 12:23:09

I just found it uncomfortable sitting and eating whilst they clean and pack up although have 2 hours work remaining!?!

I went in today around 3pm. First off, the place is a little dirty; there was a stink bug crawling on the guy's back, in front of me. And no one did speak English but I didn't have a problem communicating since I could read what was on their menu. I just pointed them out and hablo un pequeño espanol. :) 

I ordered a tongue taco and I sat down to wait for my order; took pictures for yelp. When my order was up, I went to the back to the counter to pay. I gave exact change; the prices were totally what 'mom and pop' Mexican places charge. You can tell it's a place for the locals. 

When I got home opened everything up and took pictures. I did like the fresh cilantro and onions but the tongue was a little dry for my liking. The actual taco shell was really nice, almost a little fluffy and the sauce that came with it was hot; I liked it. 

I can only give this 3 stars because of what I've mentioned above but I am willing to give them a second chance; I might try their tamales tomorrow.",2013-04-11 05:04:13

My party had for appetizers the onion straws- really onion rings, very good but expected thinner cut due to name; the seafood queso-very good; the gumbo was reported as good ( I didn't eat any);  the fried soft shell crab plate- very good, nice size but way too many fries, should have been served on toast as most places do to for oil draining which flavors the toast; an oyster poboy and a shrimp poboy were over loaded with fresh fried seafood but on a thick ciabatta type bread-not the traditional French bread-the waitress stated they ran out-this should have been mentioned when ordering so if patron only wanted French bread there is a choice; the Westbank seafood plate was good-nice size for price with sides and seasoned well; and a Mardi salad-very fresh with a good vinaigrette. For the birthday person I requested the bread pudding-pretty presentation but improvement on the recipe needed- too dry, either microwaved too much or not enough moisture in the recipe- glad it was comp'd-would not have been happy to have paid for it. 
Overall the atmosphere was nice, pretty renovation of the place that used to be a Copeland's, all of the condiments were served in little cups, which was ok but a squeeze bottle of Blue Plate mayo was on the table, very out of place, but at least it was Blue Plate (the only mayo of Louisiana!). Finally, prices were reasonable, although the 20% auto gratuity was a bit much for a party of 5. I don't believe in auto gratuity, I know everyone doesn't tip like they should, I always do and usually give more depending on service received with a smile, but when auto, I never give more. Just my policy, I have family whom work in the service industry whom depend on their tips so I understand a lot of people don't even tip. 
I will return again to try other dishes on the menu I saw, in the future.

Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. 
 We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. 
  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy, completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything.

We still got a table but it was right up front near the door and it was very uncomfortable. We had trouble getting situated at our high table and his grandparents had an ever harder time. We ordered oysters and none of them were cut properly so we had to scrape them out with our forks before we could eat them. After our appetizers came my boyfriends grandfather had to use the restroom and when we came back he told us there wasn't any soap so he told one of the employees. He intended to go wash his hands when our meals came out so that they would have plenty of time to refill the soap. Our meals came and he went back in the bathroom and the soap still wasn't refilled. Luckily, we had our own bottle of hand sanitizer with us so he had to resort to using hand sanitizer before eating his meal. The worst part is that he ordered a lobster roll. So it wasn't like he was eating with silverware. He had to eat his birthday meal with his hands that he couldn't even get soap to wash.

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out.

1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps.  Now you have 24.  You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different.  I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

I guess Philly has a pretty weak Korean food scene in general, but I wanted this place to be a little better. If it was next door I'd probably hit it up every now and then, but the problem is that we're not that close to here, and its just not good enough to warrant going very far for it.

As other reviewers have said, the burgers are not good here. I usually go for a mushroom burger but instead opted for their guacamole bacon burger. It's served on an onion ciabatta roll which did not add anything to the burger except for an overly hard texture, especially when paired with the dry burger patty. The guacamole could have used some more seasoning and the thick-cut bacon was okay. 

The fries that came with the burger were salty and soggy; my husband commented that they were likely old. There was a good amount of other customers in the restaurant , so I'm not really sure why there would be old fries unless they cooked huge batches of them in advance (maybe to keep up with their promise of ""endless french fried potatoes""?). The sweet potato chips we had as an app were fresh and also a favorite with my family, so I'd suggest getting the chips instead of the fries. 

From the prices on the menu (around $9 for burgers), you'd think that the food would be good or at least a notch higher than ""decent"". Not so at Cheeseburger in Paradise.

P.S. I had to change a diaper while there and the changing table was inside the handicapped stall.

I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.

The ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.

We started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. 

For our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.

Not quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.

- Perfectly cooked runny egg =]
- The owner/cook is incredibly sweet!!

The less good: 
- The rice to meat/veggie ratio wasn't great. They should either give less rice or give more veggies & meat

Clear signage would be much appreciated. I'm a pretty observant person and there may have been one sign anywhere in the vicinity. Most places simply note that you've selected an hour and you don't have to reenter the ticket or it notes your ""in and out"" times and doesn't charge you for less than an hour. This is a fault that is easy to fix. Also, the attendant was less than friendly when I told him it was my first time parking there and if he could make this one exception since the place was right there - he said ""Nope. Nothing I can do"" and just waited for one of us, my co-worked or myself to pay $3.00 when we were there for 45 minutes. It wouldn't read my card w/ a chip but did read hers which also had a chip. Attendants shouldn't be rude or unhelpful. 

Therefore, in busy places like Nashville, you are only as good as your parking. That gets more people to you on a regular basis and also return customers. If it is difficult to get to you - then you'll suffer. Regardless, this business will most likely flourish but the parking company may get replaced. I'll be back, but I doubt when I have to park there.",2017-11-10 19:25:07

Walking around the block we talked about how lucky we'd been on our travels with randomly finding great restaurants. Owner operated, eclectic cuisine is our preference. We saw the sign for The Pearl and checked it out on line. The glowing references are well deserved based on our experience. 

We were greeted and seated immediately at six thirty on a Saturday night. No reservations were no problem, but that may have been a function of the time of year - pre Thanksgiving. The menu was true to what we'd seen on line, but the specials that Jay went over made us reconsider. We ordered a bottle of the Castillo (garnacha) which was deftly opened and poured for tasting. A very nice, big, red, great value, and stands up to garlic!

Started with sharing the escargot and we both really liked the grated/melted cheese and copious fresh garlic combination.

The salad that came with was fresh and the vinagrette dressing was balanced and quite sufficient.

My wife had the lamb kebabs, because I don't/can't cook lamb at home. She loved them and was especially taken with the fresh local french style green beans. I tucked into the Boulliabase, which I loved and it was so loaded with clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, calamari (with grill marks and tender not rubbery) that I couldn't finish it all. Even though I wanted to! 

Jay was attentive without being intrusive, friendly and welcoming without butting into the 'catch up' conversation we were having since we were both on business in different cities during the week.

This restaurant was a true find, and we made sure to tip the very talented live guitarist/mandolinist who did such a great job with his contribution to the ambience. 

For all that, we got out at a hundred and a quarter which means it was a terrific experience, top notch food, great service and ambience all for a reasonable price.

The bad thing is, b/c it is the same as the rest, it may be hard to find something you've never tried before- but their cheese cakes looked to be their stand apart from other bakeries. This is the only ""Asian"" bakery on this street across from Nine Ting, the new Taiwanese popcorn chicken, right by Red King BBQ, and Wong Wong Restaurant. It's a solid Chinese bakery- neither fancy nor cheap and poor quality, neither special or bland but solid if you're looking for the typical Chinese desserts and pastries 

Because it's cheap, feel free to load up on a large stash of goodies! Egg tarts were 0.80$, sesame balls were also 0.80$ and the green tea roll cake was only 3.50$.

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out.

1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps.  Now you have 24.  You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different.  I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

Arrived at 7:00 on a Friday night and got a cozy table for two. The décor is Mediterranean , dimly lit and cozy. This night they had an excellent acoustic guitar player entertaining. 

We started with a cocktail, beer for him, tequila martini for me, while we perused the wine list. Ended up with a decent bottle of Santori Amarone ($85) which was quite good. 

Started with the pate platter which come out with two nice slices of pate and all the accoutrements.  ($9.00) I love pate and this did not disappoint.

We also tried the special tuna trio of the night, a smoked tuna spread on crostini, tuna sashimi and tuna crudo. All very good and fresh although the spread was just kind of a glammed up tuna salad. 

For dinner, after much debate, we went with the Paella for him and the Beef Shortribs for me. The Paella ($29) . we requested it to be crispy (as a true paella should be) and the chef obliged. Unfortunately it made the Paella so dry and overcooked it was not good at all. The shortribs, ($26) with a cabernet barbque sauce was very good. Served with a mini au gratin and fresh asparagus. The ribs were nice and tender 
, the sauce was almost bordering on overdone, almost but not quite. 

For dessert we ordered our fav limencello cake, it was good, but not as good as the craft in St Pete . Ended up at the bar for a couple glasses of Port to quell our dessert craving and get a chance to listen to the guitarist. 

While at the bar we were speaking of our dinners and before you knew it Chef Karim came out to speak with us, apologized for the Paella and told us next time we come in to ask for him personally so he can take care of us. 

You can tell he's a chef/owner that really cares about his clientel. He checked one very table and knew many patrons by their names.

I'll go back, and try his famous tangine or duck, after I ask for him personally!",2014-08-26 16:16:47

The space: beautiful, clean, bright....very Dean & Deluca'esque. Everything is order at the counter(s) - salad bar, sandwich & soup bar, prepared foods bar and then an open air market throughout.
The prices: it's not cheap ($10+ for brunch entrees, mimosa carafe $22)
The service: Not fair to comment, since it was the soft opening...it was exactly where it should've been for a soft opening.
The food: errrrr, I had the B.E.L.T. and my counterpart had the chicken and waffle biscuit. I felt like I wanted more to mine (more egg? more arugula? more balance?) the best part was the toasted sourdough. The biscuit...It's huge - as in, big gulp huge. I regret saying, it was a bit dry and seemed to be more on display and less tasty, but I digress, how do you eat something that big anyways.

Grits were delish, but lacked any jalapeño spice and the potatoes were actually very good, crispy and all.
Another friend had flattering things to say about the breakfast burrito as well. It was all....good.

Also, to be clear, this was a soft opening, so I think there are always things to iron out, however, this is not their first rodeo. I don't think I would personally return (I'm cheap), however, the space itself is worth a look and if you need a brunch place in this area for parents or out-of-towners it is dressed to impress, I have no doubt they'll do well.

Everything in here just looks appetizing.  I like Asian bakeries because the cakes are not overly sweet as most ones are in American Bakeries.  

      I have tried the chocolate cake, and different versions of the vanilla cake here (bunny and cherry).  Both were fluffy, moist, simple, and slightly sweet.  They didn't really have any difference in taste though.  The main difference here seems to be the cute decoration.  I'm okay with that though.  I get excited like a five year old child at the idea of what cute animal or fruit I will get on my cake next.  The mango pudding was okay, but not as good as I've had in some Thai restaurants, or even what I could make at home.  I haven't tried any of the buns, but they do look tasty and are priced right.

I had a great dinner which lead right into our trip to San Francisco so I'll have to write about it later! In the mean time, just wanted to post up my visit to ROAST Coffeehouse on 104 St!

It took me a long time to make my way down to ROAST but I finally did it. As much as I love the atmosphere of Transcend (may you return to downtown one day) and Credo, I think I like ROAST the best! Something about the wooden interior, the expansive seating areas and trendy wallpaper makes it a place where I'd want to sit and relax.

Joe and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty bustling from what would have expected. Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!

For that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!

ROAST Coffeehouse, thus far, is my favorite out of all coffee hangouts. Runner-up: Wild Earth Bakery. I only wished I discovered these places when I was in school! Perfect place to study. What's your favorite coffee place?",2013-02-22 18:30:37

I walked about 8 blocks from my hotel in my ill-fitted snow garb to the warmest, coziest ice cream shop I have ever been in. my husband had some hot chocolate....which they have about half a dozen different kinds.

however, the majority of my greatness of this review is based off of one flavor: red velvet cake. Now, I have to tell you, every red velvet cake I've ever had has been dry and not that appetizing. Like its supposed to taste good, but it doesn't.

When you walk in there is a bar area (deceptive because it is small, but it has a chalkboard menu which immediately made me love it). We had a reservation for my friends birthday so a host walked us through an arch way to a dining area, which was bustling with people eating (and there was another smaller dining room in the back!) It is family run with a few family photos on display around the dining space. The atmosphere is welcoming and filled with the smell of delicious food.

    Our waitress was very kind and attentive but not over bearing, always refilling our glasses and checking to make sure we enjoyed our dishes. We ordered calamari to start and it came out with a dijon horseradish sauce, perfectly breaded and fried calamari (very tender and amazingly tangy and sweet with some lemon sauce) over a bed of spinach which was a nice touch. 

     I then ordered the Linguine Dolano as a half order as my friends ordered the baked lasagna and the Cavatelli Broccoli. The half order was just the right size, still a decent portion and at a great price (mine was only $6). My dish was delightful; pasta tossed in olive oil with pine nuts, sun dried tomato with fresh garlic and basil. I was in pasta paradise. It was simple, refreshing, and extremely good. My friends loved their dishes as well and we were all members of the clean plate club. 

        When our waitress came back to ask if there would be dessert we couldn't turn it down--it was my friends birthday after all. Once she knew this, she created a ""sample platter"" especially for us, on the house. She brought us in house made tiramisu, a chocolate chip filled cannoli, and a dish of ice cream that was pretty amazing--everyone's favorite (possibly chocolate chip with some sort of sweet fig possibly) And all of their ice cream is from Serendipity's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/serendipity-homemade-ice-cream-st-louis) so I must say kudos for also promoting a fellow local business.

Make your own sandwich or choose from one of theirs on the menu? Make your own plate of food from various pre-made options like you're at Whole Foods (or Central Market, for my Texas friends - geez, I miss Central Market and HEB. Sorry, sidetracked)? Something for everyone. Healthy eaters? Options. Picky eaters? Options. 

I decided against their tasty sounding salads and sandwiches to try some of the pre-made options. I got some simply baked salmon, some kale salad, and some pesto grilled peaches. All of it was pretty good. They also have lots of options for snacks, drinks, desserts, etc. 

You go order what you want, they give you a ticket (or tickets if you go to two different lines or if you're paying for more than one person), and then they ring you up at the registers closer to the entrance. 

They also serve breakfast (I'll be back), and have a bar where you can order beer, wine, or coffee. (I got a cappuccino to go - very good.) 

C&B is another new Nashville spot that is trying really hard to be cool. High, high ceilings, white paint everywhere, so bright and airy you feel like you're in an aviary. Chairs that are beautiful but WILL leave a gorgeous geometric pattern in your legs and butt. I don't mind this as long as 1) the food is actually good, and 2) the prices aren't quadruple what they should be because you're paying for the decor. C&B isn't cheap. But overall, I liked the experience and the food.

Parking is rough, but there's a garage for the building just to the right of the entrance to C&B, and they validate for 1 hour (possibly during certain hours only, so I'd check that). I stayed for longer than an hour, so I paid $3 when I left the garage. 

Eating at C&B felt like eating in a cafeteria at a fancy museum in NYC. That's good, right?",2017-07-19 13:22:36

It makes for a good place to get some beers and watch football with the guys, and at least this place is a little more unique than some of the other ones around.

I made it here on a Friday night to meet with a group of 10 friends. They had a large table reserved for us, and we were seated quickly. The place is really cool inside, with a lodge vibe that looks like something you would see up in the mountains. It was large, and it wasn't very full the one time I was here. There are more than enough TVs to see whatever sporting event you want to watch without having to turn your head very far.

Their menu consists of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and a surprising selection of dinner entrees. We ended up with a few appetizers that were pretty good, and a whole bunch of wings. I went with their ""smoked and grilled"" bone-in wings, which were phenomenal. I got them with sauce, but I would probably just get them plain with a sauce on the side since they were that good. They were some of the best wings I've had in the city. That being said, they were also pricier than most, but at least you get what you pay for.

I was surprised to see a decent selection of good local beers on tap. They also had a couple beers under the Twin Peaks brand, and quite a few of the largely distributed craft beer brands. And of course, you can always get an ice cold glass of light domestic stuff as well. 

Service, especially considering we had such a large group, was fantastic the entire time we were eating and drinking. Drinks never went empty before getting a refill and our food came out much quicker than expected. Unfortunately, for some reason that we never figured out, our server went MIA as we were wrapping up and we had to wait around a while before we could actually ask for checks. At least we were done, so the empty glasses and plates in front of us didn't need refilled, but it was still frustrating to be stuck there as we were ready to leave. If it wasn't for that snafu, the service would have gotten 5/5.

I don't have as much of a bias against large chain restaurants as the rest of Yelp tends to have, and I was very happy with what we ended up with out of this place. The food was great, our service was almost great, it is a neat place and there are lots of TVs, the beer list was probably the one shortfall and even it wasn't that bad.

The place has a cool hipster vibe and is on Broadway so parking can be a bit of an issue. They also have excellent coffee. I paired an americano with my red velvet.",2013-11-20 19:45:46

The server was great she was very friendly and brought the refills for our drinks when she saw needed and checked if we needed anything often without being annoying. We had chargrilled oysters and Rockefeller for appetizer. Entree: 2 lobster pasta, crawfish etouffee, 8oz filet mignon, chicken Caesar salad,  crab cakes, and Mac and cheese. The sad part is no one liked their food. Lobster pasta tasted like they just dumped a can of tomato paste in the pasta and mixed it into the linguine and the lobster was over cooked which caused it to be chewy. Crawfish etouffee was too salty. Filet mignon tasted like a over cooked sirloin it came with potatoes and vegetables that look like the whole plate been sitting under the light for a long time. As for the chicken caesar salad the chicken was so dry and it had way too much dressing on the plate and it was too creamy. Crab cakes barely had any crab in it and it was just full of stuffing. We ordered Mac and cheese for my niece and it looked like it was made from a Kraft box and dried. My niece usually eats her Mac and cheese and this time she ate a little bit and didn't want it. We spent over $200 and left this restaurant having to go eat at another restaurant right after. For the first time ever that my family had to do that. Very disappointing.

Once you get past the whole idea that you're consuming a snail, you will see it is quite delicious. The texture is similar to eating a mushroom. They were served in a garlic oil sauce and sprinkled cheese on top that was divine for dipping your bread in. The fried artichoke came with a spicy chipotle mayo drizzled over it that was so yummy. For entrees we ordered chilean sea bass, monk fish, seafood crepes, and lamb shank. Everyone loved their meals! We were also served string beans and rice. My seafood crepe was filled with crab, scallops, and shrimp. I loved it. I never tried monk fish before, and I tried some of hubbys. It was very good and had a very different texture then typical white fish does. I also learned it is known as the ""poor man's lobster"". It was very good.

Since there were seven of us, we made reservations--however, when we arrived at 7 p.m. the place was only moderately full. A nice little crowd, but not loud and bustling (well, until we got there at least...). The ambiance was lovely and the restaurant had a front ""bar"" area and a back eating area that was larger than I expected it to be. Of course, the lights were set to ""romantic"" mode (as they are in most Italian restaurants) and so I apologize in advance for the poor quality of my photos.

First things first, we decided to order a couple of bottles of wine [priorities are important]. We were tickled to find that the wine list was longer than the list of food--so we had plenty of options. We got one bottle of red and one bottle of white and both were very tasty.

Since we figured that drinking our dinners wasn't a smart or grown up thing to do, we ordered salads to start the meal. They were pretty standard ""house"" salads. Though, one twist was that it had provel cheese on it--which normally I am not a fan of; however, combined with the crisp lettuce and sweet red onions I didn't mind it one bit.

Next was the main course. I ordered the lasagna and it was a-ma-zing. Like, melt-in-your-mouth, moan at the dinner table good. It had sooo much cheese. You can't go wrong with cheese, in my personal opinion.

It was served with two pieces of garlic toast that had a nice crunch to them and I really enjoyed eating a bite of my lasagna on a piece of my garlic toast. It was straight-up comfort food and I am certain that it was extremely fattening. But, who are we kidding, you can't eat that much cheese without expecting a few extra calories, right? 

Around the dinner table, the rest of the girls all got some sort of pasta dish and ordered half sizes, which seemed like a perfect sized  meal (especially if you had gotten a salad as well). Everyone claimed that their food was very good; however, I didn't hear the other girls moaning about their food like I was (though, maybe I'm just overly passionate about it...?).

Needless to say, I'd recommend the lasagna if you ever get a chance to stop by. In fact, I'm going to be so bold as to say that 1) that lasagna was the best lasagna I've ever eaten and 2) you are a fool if you get anything else! (Unless you are lactose intolerant... then, by all means, avoid the cheese-coma that is inevitable if you eat this meal.)

I would also recommend that you go when you have a little extra time. Although it didn't bother me, a few of the girls noted that the service was a bit slow [especially considering that the restaurant wasn't very full]. I think we had sat at the table for a good 30 minutes before ordering our food. Then again, we had ordered wine... so who really noticed? Plus, if you've ever been to Italy you know that getting a waiter to help you there is like some sort of Olympic challenge. Italians are just a little more leisurely than Americans are (or... a LOT more, to be honest). So, perhaps Ricardo's simply likes to provide a truly cultural Italian dining experience.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed the meal at Ricardo's and would definitely recommend it to a friend. So, next time you're in the Square, be sure to check it out!",2011-11-03 20:00:22

1) New lunch menu that tells you how many calories are in their dishes. 

2) New olive appetizer that was very good. 

3) New dessert menu that features smaller, and less caloric, choices. My wife and I shared the vanilla gelato with strawberries. It was served with fresh mint, and it was tasty. 

4) Some things didn't change: bread and olive oil, efficient service, and the manager checked in to make sure that all was well with us. We shared the scallop and spinach salad, and this was also very good. 

5) We arrived after the main lunch hour and we were able to be seated, eat, and exit within 45 minutes. Very tasty and very efficient without feeling rushed.

In terms of indiviidual items, the blue cheese pate is not on the menu but they always have it and it is delicious.  The olives are some of the best kalamatas i have had.  Ask for them with garlic.  The lamb chops are cooked to perfection, the ostrich comes with a delicious sauce, and his steaks are right up there with the best steak houses.  He makes a salad with a dressing like none you have ever tasted.  Interestingly, he also offers sushi which is some of the best we have ever had.  They can make everything for you tapas style.

It was extremely hot outside and we made the mistake of walking here from our condo (not my smartest idea). So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). 
However, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty. We sampled the jalapeno grits which sounded amazing but were pretty forgettable. 
We had a nice experience here overall, and I really want to come back and check out their cheese plates and wine in the evening.",2017-08-08 02:28:41

No smile, no interest in the table (a tip for any waiter or waitress and isn't rocket science that's how one makes it in the industry working off of tips) which could have been fairly easy for her as it was just me a harmless 34 year old whom had been cutting down trees for several hours earlier to help a friend who can't do it on their own and as it was 95 out all I wanted was a cold beer and sandwich and the peaks was less than 5 blocks from the house I was at.

Two weeks in, the setup is the same, the TVs are still in prime locations, and the local beer is all there in drafts, cans, and bottles.  

However, there are changes in the several menus given to you, starting with the cocktail menu.  Our server boasted that the head bartender studied the art of old timey cocktails intensely, reading for six months straight before ever picking up a bottle.  It seems to be the new pride and joy of Village Tap Room.  I apologize for not being about to tell you more about them, because I'm a beer gal through and through.  I can say that I drank my 3 Floyd's Yum Yum with great content, knowing that it was one of many, many beers and ciders to choose from.

And now my pride and joy: food hunting.  Most of you know that I make it my mission to find something tasty everywhere I go.  Smack dab in the center of the food menu was PUFFY TACOS in caps.  I tried to steer away from it--it could be a ploy--but your standard steakburger and tenderloin pub fare were not calling my name.  I chose shredded chipotle chicken as my protein (other options are chorizo, short rib, and pulled pork)  and mango salsa (I wasn't in a charred chipotle mood) to accompany it.  Two puffy tacos and $7 later, I feel confident about my decision of inflated fried flour tortillas stuffed with tender, spiced shredded chicken, sprinkled cheddar cheese, diced tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce, and mango salsa.  I like knowing that I have a solid go-to if someone wants to sit along the windows, people watch, and drink a pint.

I would urge anyone to go for the rack of lamb. It was by the far the best and yet delicate savory meat I've ever had the courtesy to dine upon.
And not to mention, that our waiter, whom I believe his name was Ali, was the most amazing waiter that we had experienced during our entire stay in Florida.

Their red sauce is really good. Its sweet which really hits my sweet teeth. Thats right, plural. 

The house dressing is awesome, again, kind of sweet. The complimentary bread is really a decent piece of bread and not some cheap roll. They are really good at bringing you more to wipe up that dressing!

Not sure if I've ever had their pizza warm. Cold it is very good. 

Funny story for ya. Came here for sophomore year homecoming.

To start things off, we made reservations and were seated at the back of the restaurant where every 20-60 seconds, a door would slam. The heavy slam of the door was noticeably distracting and shook our booth! It would interrupt our conversation and made it difficult to enjoy our meal. So, we had to move tables. However, the waitress - who was less than friendly and outgoing and only grew more sour faced as the night continued - found it appropriate to then move us to a seat directly across the bar instead, without telling us where we were going first. This new seat was hardly better, though we supposed it was the lesser of two evils. 

As the meal continued, we ordered lobster macaroni and the Asian shrimp for appetizers. Both were good, yet we did not get bread and butter until after our appetizers were served and cleared from our table, which we found to be a little odd. Usually, bread and butter comes first, doesn't it? Though it was not too big of a deal in and of itself, it only reflected on how unorganized and out of sorts the waitstaff seemed. 

We ordered our mains, and here is where things became even more problematic. One member of the party ordered filet with potato and green beens, and the beans were crunchy and uncooked, the potatoes dry, and the filet very fatty. Later when our extremely pleasant waitress returned with her typically less than interested attitude to our table, we expressed our concern about the filet and vegetable plate when she asked how the food was...yet she barely reacted with more than an annoyed 'sorry', as if we had done something wrong. If a waitress is going to inquire about the meal but then does not do anything for her displeased customer, why even bother asking in the first place, I wonder...?

I ordered lobster with corn and potatoes, and this was my first time ordering a real lobster dish. I had tried lobster previously and loved it; I figured if Docs is supposed to be an esteemed seafood restaurant, why not try a classic dish? However, for such an expensive plate, I was extremely disappointed. My 35 dollar entree came served without anything to crack the shell and no cocktail fork; another waiter helping the waitress serve acted annoyed when asking for utensils and a plate (can you see a theme here? The waitstaff is either overworked or simply unfriendly!); and the lobster was EXTREMELY tough and chewy, to the point where I was unable to cut it properly, if at all, and it tasted disgusting! Lobster is mild, but it is NOT supposed to be tough and 100% flavorless. I was very displeased. A new waitress I had to flag down appeared vexed though tried to help me. Then, someone - presumably the manager - came instead of our original server and we were told a new lobster plate would be served 'in just a few moments'...yet even after having the chef come out to reassure us, I did not receive my new lobster until 10:05 PM. I waited well over half of an hour for the new lobster plate. Admittedly, I was slightly pissed when our original waitress came out with the lobster just as we were getting ready to leave, and asked if she could box it up. I felt like telling her to take the box and shove it!

It was simply because by that point, we were very tired and tired of being at the restaurant where things had gone from bad to worse. After having at least four different waiters, three of which were aloof and annoyed, and terrible service along with mediocre food, we wanted OUT. Thankfully, the lobster was taken off of the bill, yet for a less than satisfactory evening we paid close to 80 dollars. 

The bottom line: Do not waste your time at this restaurant. Food is a hit or a miss, unpredictable quality and service! There is NO consistency with service and food at Doc Magrogans. Please save your time and money and go to a refutable and classy restaurant such as McCormick and Shmicks or someplace else decent. This restaurant is best for those who want to mess around at the bar and order apps vs. for a group or party coming for a nice lunch/dinner.

Her husband is a sweet heart. One time the women was extremely rude and had the nerve to charge for an extra butter. So when you go inside you pick the size of your salad and then either you can get bread or a banana but this time I ordered the bread and I must say they're bread rolls are really good but the little tub of butter they give you is not even enough to butter the whole bread so when she charged me I was a little taken back surprised to say the least.

I hate for the owners to read this, but they could easily raise their prices $2 / sandwiches.

We went back to score some take-home dinner. At $5.99, how can you beat a heaping and delicious serving of traditional lasagna and spinach lasagna. Their red sauce is dee-lish, and the bread is awesome!

We were fine, After my first cup of regular coffee and 35 minutes later when I finally was able to stop the waitress to ask for more coffee, she brought me a cup with lipstick on it...not mine. When I asked for a new cup 10 minutes after that when I could finally stop her again, I was told there was no more regular coffee only decaf. 45 minutes in we still have no food and now no coffee. And this is the first meal of the day and I have a toddler. When the meal came one hour and five minutes later, my lemon poppy pancakes were flat and rubbery..small and with a side of hard, bitter pineapple.

In fact, Mike's makes a lovely afternoon treat, and if you're up for a bit of walking, you can hit about a dozen neat spots before your ice cream melts!

Mike's gets a bit busy from time to time, but the ice cream is genuinely good and worth the wait if you aren't in a rush.

Each time, the staff has been incredibly attentive and accommodating.  Both times we had larger parties and they were so flexible in terms of splitting dishes, providing extra plates, etc.  They also allow you to order a half portion during their dinner hours which I really appreciated! 

The food here is delicious! I have sampled their salads (House, Spinach, & Caesar), some of their appetizers (calamari), their entrees, as well as a few of their desserts and have been very pleased both times.  Their menu provides a wide variety of basic Italian dishes.  In my experience, there has always been something for everyone.  Their seafood canneloni is delicious but definitely a little bit rich.  I would recommend sharing a half or full portion with a friend.  I have also really enjoyed the Linguine Louisa, being a big fan of red sauce, mushrooms, and eggplant!  

So, in conclusion, I would say four stars for the food, but five stars for the service and the experience.  The staff has made both parties I was with feel very welcome and taken care of.  We never felt rushed to leave.  Additionally, there is plenty of parking around the nearby Lafayette Park.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Unlike some of the new-age ice cream spots that have sprung up across the country (Salt & Straw http://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-and-straw-portland-2?osq=Salt+Straw and Smitten http://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-3 come to mind), Mike's is your traditional ice cream parlor right in line with some of the gems in New York and Chicago. The flavors are on the board, the cones lined up in their stands, and the servers fast and friendly. What more could you want? Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Very much unlike the new age spots, the prices at Mike's couldn't be more affordable, and my single scoop in a cone, which was sizable as you can see in the picture, was priced at only $3.50. That's value. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Before going into my actual Caramel Cone selection, I'll point out that Mike's wins when it comes to flavor variety. Simply too often I've rolled into modern ice cream or gelato spots only to find that I either have basic chocolate and vanilla to choose from or some kale and blueberry goat cheese nonsense. Mike's leaves the gentrification at the door, offering up a huge selection of classics, contemporary flavors, and combinations of the two that are sure to satisfy anyone. 

My caramel cone in particular was very, very good, with the right ratio of caramel to cone and ice cream. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

As far as I'm concerned, Mike's is the best ice cream in Nashville, and a classic like this would easily secure my patronage daily. Star Granted.",2015-10-18 20:04:07

I had the Baja burger supposedly with jack cheese, jalapenos, shredded lettuce and sour cream.  It had cheese and some mixture under the cheese.

First impression was confusion with two entrances and people did not know where the line formed. If you want to order breakfast, coffee, wine, you stand in the front line. If you want to order a salad, walk to the back of the restaurant. If you want to order prepared foods for later, walk to the back of the restaurant. No signage or direction was really given.

Ordered the fried prosciutto sandwich with spinach and poached egg with a side of parmesan potatoes. The hizzy (husband) got the brunch burrito and jalapeno grits. I asked for hot sauce and was told to go to the front to get it. Very inconvenient. They only have ONE bottle of hot sauce for the whole restaurant by the entrance. Not even by the eating area. And it was empty.  While my fresh food sat at the table 75 feet away, I had to wait for someone to refill that bottle. Like had to go to the back and refill. No extra bottles anywhere. The sides were both delicious! Although, jalapeno grits need some spice. I tasted no jalapeno. False advertisement. The potatoes were yum. My sandwich was less than desirable. Not very flavorful. The burrito was very good! Meat filled and a good blend of flavors. Prices were affordable. The huz thought they could have charged more for the burrito, but was happy they did not.

The chairs and tables are so pretty, but the chairs are too short for the tables. Now, I am short so this is exaggerated for someone like me. My husband who is almost 6' tall felt the same way. He actually mentioned it first. It is nice to have pretty decor, but utility should be first for a restaurant. We did not like the flow of the space. That line is really blocking the rest of the restaurant off. It was just awkward. 

Parking is definitely an issue, but if I lived close by, I would totally walk in for a salad or prepared meal. Just be prepared to drop some cash. $13/pound under 3 lbs of purchase for the prepared foods. $11/lb if over 3 lbs. Whole foods and Turnip Truck is almost half this price for the prepared foods.

The zucchini sandwich, however, was really disappointing. As (I believe) the only vegetarian sandwich on the menu it should consist of more than just zucchini and cheese on thin bread.

I still enjoy the chocolate cherry latte, it's not as sweet as it sounds. The pumpkin pie latte is also good, and I hear the chai hot chocolate is a treat too. The toasted marshmallow latte is quite sweet though, just to warn you. For a cold option, I like the coconut frap .. it's nice and light, not too sweet. You can switch between cold and hot for most of these options though.

I've always found their pastries to be delicious and never stale, unlike other coffee houses. The lemon swirl is to die for, if you like a strong lemon taste -- lots of flavour in every bite, with chunks of chewy lemon. Yum! The cinnamon swirl and chocolate croissants are also tasty. I was sad when they discontinued their key lime cookie, those were delicious! Unfortunately it wasn't popular enough so they took that off the menu too.

You have to park in the garage set aside for the apartments.  The apartments are not yet occupied, but I still had to drive to the 3rd floor and try to fit into a parking space that was designed for a Mini Cooper.  There was one small elevator which never arrived, so I walked the three levels.  I can't imagine how parking will be once the apartments, hotel and other retail stores are open.  This is not a knock on the restaurant but getting in to eat or buy food is not going to be easy.

Atmosphere: decorations were an interesting mix of tacky and elegant. The music was not the usual generic random-Asian-string-instrument, but J-pop! And artists I actually knew, such as X Japan and Hamasaki Ayumi.

Service: attentive, polite, helpful.

And the food! Yummy. (Yes, I went there.) I ordered an $11 three-roll sushi lunch, with East, Spicy Salmon and Eel Rolls. All were delicious, I didn't even need to wasabi or soy sauce. My friends ordered the cheaper yakisoba and shrimp tempura lunches, which were ""quite good"" and ""great"" respectively. The tempura breading was also ""fabulous"" but the sauce that came with it too vinegary. All lunch specials came with miso soup and salad, which were not outstanding, but satisfying.

Two appetizers, yakitori and beef negimaki, were also enjoyed. Great char on the bottom of the negimaki, and the presentation was fun. We only received two skewers of yakitori, sadly, and had to divide them; the chicken was somewhat bland but the vegetables (green peppers, mushrooms, onions) made up for it.

After our food was finished, or packed up in doggy bags (stapled even! how nice of them) we were handed a complimentary plate of fried(?) breaded(?) banana drizzled in lime(?) green sauce. Well, whatever it was, I ate most of it. Beautiful texture and flavor, especially with their lovely whipped cream.

Even after all that, we ordered a dessert to share- they have quite the selection! Thus, the deliciously decadent chocolate truffle, sized somewhat like a tennis ball. Composed of gelato and cocoa dusting, among other things, and topped with more of that whipped cream and a cherry- mmmmm.

This all cost me $9, which was ridiculous.

The café is moderately sized and fairly open, but it makes up for the open space by creating comfortable nooks and separate seating areas throughout the room. There are couches towards the street-side, booths and high tables near the middle, and high-backed chairs and coffee tables located in the direction of the rear.

It isn't just the coffee or the rustic atmosphere that makes Roast so fantastic, though. They've recently undergone a menu overhaul and, rather than just the usual cakes, pastries, and sweets, now offer breakfast and lunch options à la Chef Andrew Parker, which change daily.

And, yeah...they sell wine. It's always a tough decision for me once I reach the counter at Roast, since I love coffee and I adore wine. Roast's wine selection is fabulous because it serves up a variety of reds, whites, and rosés from across Canada, keeping it local and supporting wineries from the Okanagan and Niagara regions.

The café is also a great location for holding events (particularly literary/artsy ones) or hosting a meeting (they have a Community Room to accommodate them).

He wrote his name with (1 of the 3 available crayons) upside down & backwards towards him on the paper covering the table cloth, but easily readable for us. He introduced himself as he wrote it and asked what he could get us to drink. He quickly brought a warm loaf of fresh bread for us to tear apart and dredge in their delicious garlic and olive oil. 

We ordered Mozzarella caprese, warm spinach salad, and capellini pomodoro to split between the two of us. David brought out mozzarella frittas by mistake, but when we told him that wasn't what we ordered, he quickly apologized and offered to replace it with the mozzarella caprese. The frittas looked so good, we decided to keep them. They were delicious, lightly breaded with a tasty arrabbiata sauce. When the frittas were gone, I dipped the remainder of the bread in the extra sauce. 

The spinach salad was topped with creamy, toasted goat cheese that really added to the flavor of the spinach. Try to get a small bit of cheese in every bite. Supposed to have prosciutto, but there wasn't any? We don't care to eat the garlic slices, so picked them out, but loved the flavor they left behind, which blended perfectly with the lemon juice.

Took 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. Ordered bread when it came out it was super hard and cold in the center. Waitress came back over and told us the bread could have been frozen and that she would have them put more in the oven. 

Finally got our food and we needed to go boxes. We had to ask another waiter for the boxes. Our waitress came over and asked if we needed to go boxes when we had already received them from the other waiter. Asked for a bag three times. When the waitress brought us our check she asked how old our baby was and completely ignored me and was staring at my husband for an answer. He told her that I was speaking to her and she had the nerve to ask me if I still love my baby. And then said just kidding and walked away. 

We paid and the waiter that was being trained by the waitress brought our receipts and card back to us and stood there at the table waiting for us to sign the receipt. 

We spoke with the general manager as we were leaving and he stated that this was not an off day and people have been acting the same today as they have been for months.

The newly renovated building looks nice from the outside, but I feel like the prices do not match with their strange ambiance inside. For example, one side of the restaurant has nice looking tables. The other side of the restaurant uses these cheap, brown laminate tables. It's so weird! Maybe they can decor with some cloth tablecloths or something because honestly, it just feels so strange. Reminds me of eating at a cafeteria. 

The appetizers we ordered were seafood gumbo, chargrilled oysters,and their version of the bang bang shrimp. It was just average. Nothing too unique or special about it. The cheese used on the oysters tasted a little strange. Nothing a little salt could not fix. The shrimp was way too sweet for me. So beware, if you don't want diabetes! :P

The fried seafood platter was very good. It came with a softshell crab, oysters, shrimp and catfish with fries and hushpuppies.It was deifnitely big enough to split with 2-3 people. 

One of the other guests at the table ordered  a roast beef po-boy, but for some reason it was not on po boy bread. It seemed more like a fancy sandwich. The bf ordered the grilled Mahi-Mahi which was pretty good. Tasted very fresh. 

Overall worth a try, but skip if you are going on a fancy date unless you are going to be seated on the fancy side of the restaurant. :P Also, if you are eating in a group make sure to bring cash.

There's not much to say really: it's exactly what you'd expect Bibimbap to be. The menu is small. It's basically Bibimbap and then Kimchi with some specials that change from time to time. The only negative, but not enough to take off a point, is that the portion sizes are quite small for what you pay. I always order extra meat and it still doesn't fill me up. I'm not even a big eater.

I came there on a mid afternoon, most of the pizza there looked like it was sitting for a while. Tasted like it too.. Like my pizza was reheated in the oven, but I swore it either tasted like old pizza or pizza from yesterday.. I don't know. 

While my service was rude, my pizza tasted a day old and the place looks a little dirty despite it being renovated, I could tell the deep dish pizza was good. The guy before me ordered it and was raving about it, made me kinda jealous I didn't order the deep dish - I guess it must of been made fresh.

There's a few TVs for sports viewing, I think they serve beer and the pizza was pretty cheap.. 2-2.25$ per slice with taxes. I want to give it a 2 rating but this place has potential compared to most of the other non-chain pizza places..... Although I'd say Sbarro might be a step up.

I will never go back.

Firstly, the space is inconveniently laid out.   I had to go to three different stations to order what I wanted, and then go to yet a fourth station to pay.  Maybe it's possible to have some communication between the serving stations and the coffee bar, so I can order coffee from the food station, and go to the coffee station to pick it up, instead of having to wait in line again to order coffee?

But that is not the reason I will not go back.
The food I had was all very good, and it's a nice-looking, clean place.
The service, however, was the most insulting and rudest and hostile I've encountered in a long time.

Many of the items in the cold prepared food section were not labeled, so I told the man behind the counter that I was a vegetarian, and wanted to make up a plate of a few items that didn't have meat, eggs, seafood, etc.     I asked him what items were vegetarian, and he growled at me and said ""just tell me what you want"" in an incredibly rude and hostile manner.   I assumed, thusly, that he would steer me away from any items that weren't vegetarian.   I pointed to one item, and asked if if were vegetarian.  He said ""how much you want,"" hostile and rudely, like I was wasting his time.   I said a spoon.  He put a spoon's worth on the plate.  I pointed to another item, and asked ""how about that?"" and he said, again, ""just tell me what you want"" in such a hostile way, I was really taken aback.  He was surly and beyond rude.  He made no effort to mask a nasty and rude temperament. Every time I tried to confirm that an item was vegetarian, he would just say ""tell me how much you want."" I finally said to him that I thought he was being unnecessary hostile and rude and not helpful.    

I left it at that, and went to pay.  One bite into my dish, however, I tasted shrimp.  I went back to the counter, and asked him what the salad was. He said shrimp salad.  I  asked him why he would give me that after I repeatedly told him that I was a vegetarian, and he just glared at me.    

I asked to speak to the manager, who was the other man behind the food station.   I told the manager that his server was rude to me, and the manager said ""I don't think he was.""
WHAT?
I was stunned.  
You know what, Mr Manager? I don't care what you think.  Your job is customer service, and to find out why the customer felt he had a terrible experience.
Did you do that?
No. 
You immediately sided with the server, without having any idea what transpired between us.  The restaurant was noisy, the server's back was to the manager, and there is no way on earth that the manager could have heard what his server said to me, or the tone in which he said it. 
None.  
Yet, he sided with the server instead of finding out what happened?!?
He also did not offer to refund the cost of the shrimp salad that I asked him to remove from my plate.

Perhaps non-vegetarians might not empathize with my anger, or think I'm overreacting, but if you are a vegetarian of long standing and mistakenly eat meat because of someone else's incompetence and hostility, I think you will understand how angry I was.

I asked for the rude server's name, but the manager would not give it to me.  When he saw how angry I was, he finally tried to be friendly and very insincerely conciliatory,  but I told him it was too late.   He had a chance to find out what the problem was, but, instead, he quickly defended his worker and told me, essentially, that I was wrong.
The manager needs to learn to listen to all sides of a story, and to show some concern for a customer's complaints before telling the customer that he is wrong.  
When he finally wanted to listen, it was too little, too late.
And the server needs to understand that it is the customers' business that allows the corporation to pay his wages, and he best be polite to ensure that they come back.
I will not ever be treated that badly and rudely.

I recognize and can overlook that people are not always in the happiest mood, and I can overlook occasional surliness, but the manager's and the server's attitudes were both beyond the pale, and I can not condone a manager who told me that I was wrong, before he even knew what his server said and the manner in which he said it.
I always thought the customer was right.  Apparently, that is not a lesson they teach at C & B.",2018-03-20 17:39:36

Food: Good
Atmosphere: Nice

My brother and I were looking for a seafood place to take our elderly father. Doc Magrogans filled the bill. The hostess was quite accommodating and seated us at a table that both had plenty of room and was out of the main traffic pattern. 

Our waiter greeted us quickly, but there was an odd, lengthy lull between every part of our order, Just getting glasses of water took a while.

The food, when it arrived was good. An assortment of chowders was good - the yellow squash bisque was the best. Fried calamari was crisp, and the sauce had good heat to it. My Dad's filet, was, well, a filet - neither good nor bad. My brothers bouillabaisse was more a hearty fish stew over pasta, but it was still good. My swordfish was fine.

I had the ""Chicken Portobello"" which was a huge portion that was plated over a very ample bed of ""orzo with spinach & vegetables"".  The flavors of this dish were quite impressive, not too salty as with most chain restaurants.  Only $13.99.....well worth the price due to the unlimited fresh baked bread that was delivered piping hot to our table.

Daughter had one of those Bowtie pasta dishes with chicken....it looked a lot like the dish she orders at the Cheesecake Factory.  She devoured every drop on the plate.

Wifey ordered the salmon ""low calorie"" plate, which consisted of baked salmon and fresh vegetables.  She seemed very pleased.

They are offering a special ""extra"" where you can get your choice of Appetizer and choice of dessert for only $5.99 extra. (a $13.50 value based on the individual prices of the crab-stuffed mushrooms and the smothered chocolate cake, which we all shared).

The total bill, including the tip, was under $55.  We were completely satisfied with both the food quality and service from Tyler, our young waiter.

As chain restaurants go, you could do a LOT worse than Romano's.

Due to the competition with the nearby BUFFETs at the casinos and hotels, THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION must try harder in order to lure the Reno tourists away from the cheap buffet deals that proliferate in Nevada.

We ordered chips and queso with venison chili, two orders of stacked nachos with chicken, and two orders of fried pickles.

I ended up eating a whole order of nachos to myself and decided to be fat and order mozzarella bites for dinner.  Everyone else got actual entrees.  

Everyone seemed to enjoy the rest of their food.  I noticed on the way out there were a LOT of open tables all over the place but they were on a 45 minute wait.

Double Shot Amaretto Sours for drink order and they were great!  We were off to a great start.

Appetizers : Zucchini Bites & Toasted Ravs (see pics).  Excellent in taste.  Really enjoyed the sauces they served with the zucchini.  Zucchini portion is enough for a table to share.  The Ravs were larger than your normal ravs and packed with flavorful meat.  There are only 4 Ravs, so order accordingly.

Entrees: (see pics) Seared Scallops, Cedar Salmon, Crab Cakes & Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  OMG, everything tasted exceptional!  We truly enjoyed the entrees.  What I loved is that each entree is available in a petit or large portion.  The flavors were spot on and well balanced.  The sides were very complimentary to the main focus of the plate.  I have to say the Sauteed Spinach and the Vanilla Sweet Potatos...oh wow...I could eat a plate of those for dinner several times over.

We didn't have room for dessert, however, the restaurant was kind enough to provide the BDay girl with a free dessert, which you don't find too often anymore.  They also brought the table 6 mini chocolate chip cookies that were complimentary.. they even tasted good.

Picking this restaurant was a last minute rush decision, but we are not disappointed that the evening took us here.  Will most definitely be back.  Kudos to the chef!!",2012-02-12 06:20:11

One thing I've noticed is that they hire pretty women, hence the name Twin Peaks...you'll catch that on the way home. My waitress was Elizabeth...all the way from AZ...very pretty lady with tattoos and piercings. Anyway, I sat by the fireplace because I was cold (you would think ""why on a summer day?"")...I'm always cold. Anyway, it's typical bar food like fried pickles, wings, a few salads, burgers (a lot of their burgers are filled with bacon...so unless you don't mind having very high cholesterol...go for it...I couldn't do it and I love bacon). Anyway I got the Steak salad (med. rare...just the way I like it) with a cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing. For the most part it was really good, I just wish it had a little sweetness to it, just to counter all of the savory flavors of the steak. My associate ordered the meatloaf with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf looks like a steak. It's baked and grilled, however it is shaped like a steak. He said it was good. I didn't want to eat too much it was getting late. I contemplated on a dessert which was a bread pudding and some sort of brownie with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and a whole bunch of fixings...it sounded really good, I just think I was in the mood for something that heavy right before a movie. Overall it was a pretty good experience. Next time I go, I have to try their wings...from what I hear, everyone says they are really good.

My girlfriend and I used a Groupon to try the place out. We didn't even know that it existed prior to the Groupon, and let me tell you, this was experiential marketing at it's finest. They've created return customers out of us.",2012-03-07 15:40:35

The good stuff:
-Nice ambience and lighting. Romantic/chill.
-Some nice new dishes, and a low calorie notifier for the healthier dishes, as the portions here can be quite out of hand.
-Pretty good wine selection. I had a nice syrah from Spain.
-You can still draw on the tables. I don't have kids, but I was bored and drew something anyway. I imagine this allows the parents to go to a decent restaurant with the kids, since they will have something to do.

Cons:
-Service was meh.
-Food came cold and late.
-Vegetables were a bit too marinated in oily stuff. It was a low calorie dish, but apparently few restaurants know how to prepare nice fresh veggies without completely masking the tastes of the vegetables themselves.",2011-12-06 04:37:49

Came here Sunday with some friends after having passed it a ton of times walking on Broadway. I just learned that it's open pretty late too! Till around 11pm on weekdays if I'm not mistaken. 

It was my first time here, and I asked the guy scooping the ice cream what was his favorite, so he gave me a bit of the caramel cone ice cream flavor to try - IT WAS DELICIOUS. Just a spoonful - but I clearly got a scoop of that one, no cone, just in a cup. And it was even more delicious now, since it had little chunks of crunchy caramel cone.

Literally the only ice cream that's been better is Jeni's, but this is still delicious and the best dessert on Broadway. Definitely coming back!",2013-02-12 17:24:57

I didn't really see the ""crab"" that was supposed to be in it. I got the redfish pontchatrain which the veggies and potatoes were really good. Fish was decent. Not sure it's worth $32. My dad had a filet. It tasted good and seasoned to me but the meat was kind of tough for a filet and it was overcooked. The waitress said they would take care of it. We didn't really even complain about it- just gave our honest opinion on the dish. But the check came and it wasn't taken care of. I guess that's where my low rating comes from. Don't say you'll comp something and then not comp it. I thought maybe she just didn't put my to go order on the bill to make up for the steak ""comp"" but it turned out that she just forgot to put my to go order in all together. So then I had to re order my to go dish for my mom after we had finished dinner and waited another 20 minutes after our meal for it. And then she kindly brought me the check for the to go plate. Little confusing but whatever. Maybe I'll come back to give it another chance.

I've been in to Tsevis' three times to pick up carry-out, because I don't typically sit-down at strip-mall eateries.

One evening I waited at the host stand for my food, and the young man acting as hostess made personal phone calls on his cell phone (presumably to his girlfriend) while dropping the F bomb repeatedly.

The tuna tartar had potential, but needed some finishing salt and maybe a little heat and/or crunch to make it more interesting. 

Ordered three rolls and they were awful.  The spicy tuna and the unagi rolls contained this weird mixture, which I assume was pureed fish.  I've never experienced that before.  The salmon rolls had too much rice and the seaweed was too thick.  We slathered the rolls in soy sauce and wasabi to make them more palatable. 

Ordered three pieces of sushi.  They were some of the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had. The salmon was not fresh.  The hamachi was boring.  The striped bass, which was the cheapest of the sushis, was actually the most flavorful. 

A crisp Riesling is usually a good accompaniment to sushi.  Unfortunately, there is not one on the menu.  The one they had was cloyingly sweet, with no acid or fruit.  It wasn't even finished!  The pinot noir was too earthy.  The cava, while not great, was the best of the options. 

The main restaurant can be very loud.  The small side booths for two are a good option for a couple who want to be able to converse.",2018-02-25 15:39:50

This place is literally the best, most authentic korean food I've had thus far in philadelphia. They offer only a limited menu of bibimbap (with various proteins), pajeon (scallion pancake), and yuk gae jang (beef stew), but they do it right! I think it's advertised as a take-out joint, but the actual restaurant is a hole in a wall spot on south st that seats about 8-10 people, max. I saw the glowing reviews and though skeptical, decided to bike down here with a friend for dinner and was not disappointed. The pajeon was smaller than I imagined, but delicious and surprisingly filling - certainly enough to hold you over until the main dish. I love traditional bibimbap, and BAP does it SO SO well. I always get the classic marinated beef as my protein, and this particular version comes with soybean, carrots, cucumbers, mushroom, cabbage, a gooey egg, and broccoli! I would HIGHLY recommend paying the extra dollar for the dolsot option to get that crunchy rice on the bottom for more flavor! Love this place and will definitely be back whenever I need my korean food fix! Maybe I'll try the yuk gae jang next time!

As soon as I was walked in, I was standing right next to the counter where the cook is frying up the ingredients that go inside the tacos on a griddle.  

It was a gray over cast day and I noticed some patrons eating big bowls of soup.  They only have two kinds of soup Menudo (no thanks) and some kind of pozole soup that is only offered two days out of the week.  With that in mind, I decided to only try the tacos. 

I ordered a chorizo, beef, and pastor (pork) taco.  The women told me uno momento and before I knew it, my order was ready.  The tacos come with an OUTSTANDING salsa verde, a lime, red and white onions, and cilantro.  

I tried the chorizo taco first and it was OUTSTANDING!  The chorizo had great flavor and a little bit of heat.  The tortillas where cooked over a griddle and were great!  Next, I tried the beef taco.  This taco was not what I expected.  The beef resembled the beef that is used on a cheese steak.  It was cut up into small, thin pieces.  I was a little skeptical and thought the taco would be bland, but I was wrong.  The beef taco had a nice flavor.  My final taco left was the pastor.  Again, did not look the way I expected it.  The pastor was cut into tiny bits and many of the pieces were over cooked.  The pieces that where not hard and crunchy had a nice taste.  This was my least favorite of the three, but it was still tasty.  

Overall, I was blown away with how great their tacos tasted.  They speak very little to no English.  If you are use to frequenting places that speak little English, you will not feel out of your comfort zone.  For those who are not use to it, don't worry about it.  You will make out fine.  I plan to make many more trips for their tasty tacos in the future.",2012-11-19 05:06:06

Theirs is mixed with ricotta, at least for the eggplant parmigiana. Maybe that's cheating to slip cheese in there but it is a real treat to find good sauce in an Italian restaurant in tampa. 

We ordered the eggplant parmigiana and two pizzas. One gardinia pizza with eggplant,  zucchini and other vegetables. And a classic margherita pizza as we wanted a point to compare to the other places we've tried. 

The pizza is good. Three stars. The toppings were good. Mine came out a bit too cool but my husbands pizza was piping. My mother loved the pizza. The crust can be better but it is good pizza for the average person (I'm admittedly a  pizza snob). 

The eggplant parmigiana was 4 stars. Very good. A delight!  Eggplant very tasty. My husband thought it was too mushy but I liked it. The cannoli's were very good. The filling was a little thin for me but good flavor. Apparently they have tiramisu too.

I certainly enjoyed eating it, but then again, I just enjoy eating ice cream in general. Ultimately, though, I wouldn't say it was any better than a place like Baskin Robbins. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and it's certainly nice to know about if you happen to be downtown, but I wouldn't say it's worth going out of one's way to acquire in the way that Jeni's and Legato are. The consistency of the ice cream is not quite the way I would prefer it, and I prefer flavor profiles which are a little more in-your-face. Mike's diverse selection includes a lot of crowd pleasers, but nothing particularly memorable in my opinion. Still, the price is reasonable given the location, the portions are ample, and let's be honest, it's hard to REALLY go wrong with ice cream.",2014-03-03 03:00:51

Yes, it was a lot colder in Nashville than I thought it would be and I only packed t-shirts and yes I was freezing on Music Row but why not get in some ice cream, especially when it's cold? It's my version of joining the polar bear club.

The inside looks like an old school soda shop which is nice. I always wanted to see what one looked like and Mike's fits the bill, even the soda jerk mural on the wall.

Decor only goes so far though, if you come to a place that says it is an ice cream fountain you better have the goods to back it up. I got the pistachio and peanut butter in a cone. My friend for nutter butter and the raspberry cheesecake. My peanut butter scoop was a little too thick, it was really like frozen peanut butter, delicious but really heavy. However, my pistachio was dead on though I thought it was flavorful but still light.

I tried the butter butter and it was what I was looking for in the peanut butter flavor. After reading the reviews and finding it's one of their homemade flavors I know why it was so good. The raspberry cheesecake also stood out and was jealous of the choice she made.

I would normally award three stars but something stuck out to me during my visit, at the front of the store was a gentleman who obviously hadn't bought anything in a while and was disheveled looking. It was cold out and the staff and owners had it in their hearts to let this man stay out of the cold and warm up as long as their doors were open, that should stand for something.",2010-01-21 04:08:53

I don't get many chances to wake up on a Sunday to gorgeous weather and be able to casually enjoy a small morning snack but for the first time in a long time, I was finally able to do this! No better time spent than at Helena Avenue Bakery. The only way I can describe the vibe here is modern rustic with a cute outdoor seating area that's shaded with umbrellas. A small part of me was making comparisons between this place and Republique in LA which is a huge compliment given all the great things about Republique! The scale of their menu and baked goods are much smaller though but the vibe here still somehow reminds me of Republique. I chose three items to share between 2 people. 
-Matcha Latte - fairly standard, price about what I expect for the size, would recommend getting a hot one
-Blueberry and Lemon scone - I'm not typically a scone persony but I really wanted to try this one out. I wasn't disappointed! Lots of blueberry with a lemony glaze. The scone was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.
-Peanut and cashew butter with Banana toast - Hands down one of the best nut butter mix spreads I've ever had spread thickly over perfectly toasted sourdough bread. I wonder if they make it in house or if it's bought from somewhere because....I need more of this! The thinly sliced banana pieces cover the entire toast topped with bits of rosemary which just adds that extra flavor kick. As easy as it sounds like it is to make this at home, enjoying the toast here was pretty darn delicious.

Asked for a medium rare brunch burger, received a well done burger with burnt bacon and 4 bite sized bits of potato with an awkward arrangement of grapes and strawberries. I took a couple bites hoping the burger would be more red and put it down on my plate. My boyfriend ordered their crabcake eggs benedict which came with fully poached eggs (no runny yolk), cold crabcakes, and dried out asparagus. We're not picky people and we never send food back to the kitchen, ever.

The manager came around and we both hesitated when she asked us how everything was. We explained what happened with our order and it was clear we hadn't eaten much of our brunch. Without even blinking she said she would replace our meal and that it would be comped. I've never seen such instant customer service. The food that replaced our original dish was night and day, it was like different people had cooked it.

I'm not jumping this to a 4 star because even though the replacement food we received was exceptionally better, it was still just mediocre food.

With the wall facing the street being all windows, the inside was flooded with natural light. They had a quite large sushi and bar counter in the middle, with seating all around it. They also had small two-person booth seating on the side as well. Very clean decor, I am glad they didn't put up any kind of cheap or fake Asian ""artworks"" on the wall.

We ordered an appetizer and side dish to go with our sushi rolls. We chose Creamy Rock Shrimp, Lobster Fried Rice, Sindy Roll and Old City Roll. All in all, they were all very tasty, high quality and we enjoyed them very much. Yes, everything was perfect until we ordered some desserts... 

Since they didn't have a dessert menu, we ordered Tree Cake and Green Tea Cheesecake based on the description of the dessert that our waitress gave us. 

This so-called Tree Cake...I call it ""rip-off"" cake. Our waitress described it as a cake made with almond, egg and butter. When it came out, I was shocked what it really was... If you are familiar with a common and popular sweets in Japan, one of them is called Baumkuchen which is actually a German layered cake. They can be purchased from most bakeries and stores, and not so pricey unless you go to some fancy boutique to get it. The cake we were presented with, in my opinion, was store-bought, and sliced as thinly as possible. For $10, you can buy an entire cake!!! Very disappointing... And on top of that, it was dry (with these thin slices being cut off from the cake, I wonder how long it has been since the cake was first purchased?). And if that is not enough, we were given spoons to eat this...why? I don't know...

Our waitress was very friendly and polite, and we were well taken care of. Everything we had, other than the Tree Cake was great. High quality and tasty, a bit on pricey side, but that comes with the quality. I wish if we made a different choice with the dessert. But then, you live and you learn.

Why did I ask for different bread? here's a question to answer your question: Can someone please tell me how bread can be both burnt and freezing at the same time?

Overall, the food was really nothing spectacular and it was way overpriced. My chicken florentine was $22. It came with an overly sweet caesar salad and some steamed baby cut carrots. $22 for a piece of chicken? Sue's pasta was pretty good, but even that was sans protein and $17.

Mike's is a small ice cream parlor, one that barely fits the patrons and its popularity. There is some effort that went into decorating this place like an old school ice cream parlor, with it's small tables and chairs, counter tops, and unique wall décor. 

Mike serves a wide selection of handmade ice cream in a variety of different ways and they are extremely generous on their scoops. Between the two of us, we shared a single scoop of pralines and cream on a waffle cone and it was almost too much--and we're both like our ice cream! The ice cream is very creamy and incredibly delicious. In this particular flavor, there were generous amounts of praline--a few in every bite, and lots of caramel swirls. Our ice cream was truly divine and it seems like everyone else's ice cream was also delicious as no one could make it to the register without first taking a bite!

Our waiter was friendly and he kept the drinks and fresh bread coming.  The bread was delicious, piping hot with rosemary and they have olive oil and balsamic for dipping.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli for lunch and it was really good with lots of mushrooms.  However, I think the plate may have been left under the warmer a bit too long.  The plate was scalding hot - no biggie but the parts of ravioli without sauce were very dry and almost crunchy.  That's really the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4.  I was really looking forward to that cheat lunch and it just didn't live up to my expectations.",2016-01-20 17:03:49

This turned out to  a huge disappointment on several levels -

We  went for lunch  the restaurant  was  basically  empty at 1:45 when we  arrived - 
the service  was  terrible - 
We were presented with the dinner menu  and when we asked for the lunch menu were told  this was all there was...

Once the  order was placed, the waiter parked himself  by the cooking line  & never came back, so we had to ask the bus boy for the Focaccia bread. The waiter then brought  everything  directly after the bread arrived, therefore we didn't have time to enjoy the bread, which  we  normally  devour as soon as it is put in front of us. Then had  to again wait for someone to come back so we could  ask  for balsamic vinegar to  add to the dipping olive oil.

My mom ordered:
Calamari Fritti crisp-fried, pepperoncini, arrabbiata 10
& house salad

The birthday girl ordered:
Bellini Cipriani - la marca prosecco, white peach purée 7

and we shared

Italian for Two @ $25.00

Tappas - Zucchini Fritti
 
Eggplant Quadratini
roasted eggplant, basil, tomato, ricotta salata, red chile 13.5

Chicken Milanese (add $3.00)
arugula Parmesan salad, roasted potatoes,  lemon butter

ok the -   Bellini  in a  tulip glass - lovely  but  $7.00??
The  Calamari was  a disappointment -  pale & - not  crispy  as  advertised-  the  house salad was  good.
Zucchini Fritti -  my daughter & I  each ordered one,  which for a change  was a mistake because one would have been enough for 3,  it was good but... not as good  as it looked on the menu or  I had hoped -  the "" ribbons"" were  not  long ribbons  instead they were small  pieces and a little greasy - should have  ordered only one of these and a different 2nd  tappas...
The Chicken Milanese was  pounded so thin  that it was  dried out &  had  no flavor -  the coating  was thicker than the chicken& the sauce  over top was  almost  non existent  - the arugula salad  had  absolutely no  taste what so ever,  the potatoes were plentiful, cooked  correctly &  had   loads of roasted garlic  which I did  love -

The eggplant quadratini was good going down, not so  much  later that evening when my daughter became ill and eventually  threw up after being miserable for several hours ... therefore she never touched the  leftovers...

The  ambiance we had always loved  in the  dining room  was  gone -  the music was no longer classic Italian music, the beautiful white gladiolas  were gone and  the happy birthday song which the waiters sing  in Italian never even happened - 
The hostess never looked up from the stand  to say goodbye -

Went on a busy Saturday night. After missing our reservation due to traffic, the hostess helped us to get seated right away. That was awesome. The restaurant is beautiful. We were told that the menu was new this weekend. Everything looked good, so maybe the menu is a bit too big, but that's not really a problem. After looking over the menu for a few minutes, the waitress came over to give us a ""tour"" of the menu. Dear Doc M's: This is not people's first time eating in a restaurant. No one needs a tour of the menu.

Ordered some oysters, which were FANTASTIC! Loved the Shooting Points-had never tried those before. Then the waitress came back to give us a tour of the menu (yes-another one). Remember, by this point, we had had menus for almost 20 minutes. We cut her off and told her we were ready to order. It took about 25 minutes for apps to come out. The clam chowder, a special this month, had a great flavor profile, but was definitely too thick, and for a $9 caesar salad, it was way too small. Entrees were very good, but definitely on the small side. Lobster roll was NOT served on buttered brioche, but instead on a small hoagie roll with bland fries. Grilled and blackened swordfish were both delicious. 

In the future, I think we would definitely go back, because the food was very good. But, you might be better off just getting a bunch of appetizers and items from the raw bar considering the size of the entrees. I hope they do away with the menu tours, and the coupons at the end offering free appetizers. That's cheesy.",2013-02-10 19:10:22

I had our server touch the fettuccini with his finger to verify and he concurred that the noodles were refrigerator cold. He then took my plate and must have placed it in he oven and yes it came back hot, but the bottom of the lasagne was burnt and stuck to the plate, I couldn't scrape it off to eat it.

My husbands tea sat empty at the edge of the table for quite some time and was refilled as we were paying our bill.

1. first and foremost the food has to be not just great, but great every time. Check!
2. Price - on par with the competition and even a little higher if its really good. Check!
3. Service - be happy to see me & take my Order; if anything goes wrong or it takes longer then normal - come to me with real empathy and offer apologies and to fix what ever is a-rye. Wow, although really rare - they are experts at caring about you and your meal. Check!

The icing on top of all of this - The Owner is there a lot of the time, the employees have been there for years and years and are happily working where you can watch them = more proof of excellent management - very little turnover, happy workers. 

If an eatery has great food and great service but the price is way over the top no one goes frequently. If you have great prices and great service, but the food sucks - no one goes more then once. Finally if you have great food and great prices but the people there are rude, nasty with poor service never fixing mistakes without an argument - no one goes back.
All 3 categories must always be excellent to get 5 Stars

So the secret to Ardmore Pizza is they are exemplary in all 3 categories all the time - very rare indeed.

Wish they had a sit-down restaurant - oops but then they would need exemplary waiter/waitress staff and a floor manager, dishwashers and so forth - Maybe not, its fine that Ardmore Pizza is known as  The 5 Star Takeout Pizza (and more) eatery of the Main Line.

Cheeseburgers and Parasites 


Actually it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't great either. The problem for me, was that if a particular food item is displayed in your restraunts name, it better be damn good. These burgers weren't paradise, they were simply average. They have some decent burger toppings ( I myself got a bleu cheese and onion straw burger, which was decent but not wow) but I was surprised to see that the CheeseBurger in Paradise burger was simply a cheeseburger...served with a pickle. 
To go along with that, the fries were blah, McDonald's shoestring sized yet not even as crispy, laying somewhat limp on the plate. I prefer steak fries, I like girth ( ...that's what she said!) 

Upon being sat, the song "" Cheeseburger in Paradise"" by Jimmy Buffett, was playing over their stereo system. I had a brief but rational worry that this song would be played on a loop as I ate. Thankfully, it wasn't nor were we subjected to JBs entire catalog but the CIP song was peppered liberally in the song rotation , so that we heard it at least 3 times while dining. 

The tikibar decor was cool but not terribly impressive. The service was very good, although it was pretty dead even for a Monday night. My son loved the paper umbrella that came with his kids drink and I could tell that his older sister, who proudly orders drinks and entrees off the regular menu, was seething in jealousy yet too proud with her ""adult"" status to ask for one.. 

I didn't use the facilities but both offspring reported that they were ""freaked out"" by the peeping fish placed strategically in the bathrooms. We didn't get dessert but their Chocolate Nachos sounded intriguing , until I saw the faces of a couple nearby, who got the dish. It didn't look pretty. 

Overall, it was an average experience. I would not go out of my way to either return to CIP or to avoid it. When there are so many places to choose from, CIP needs to distinguish itself from all the other restraunt chains. My advice would be to ""beef"" up those titular average burgers and to get those rude fish out of the bathrooms, that like to watch people make toilet.",2009-08-19 18:25:47

My boyfriend asked the waiter if he had a glass like he drew, and he obviously got upset and flustered saying they always serve house wine in a mug. 

I understand its traditional to serve it in a glass, in Italy, but if you know anything about wine, red optimal flavors are represented in 60-65F degrees, white a bit colder 50-55F degrees. If in the least they should give the option to customers of traditional customs or in a stem glass which they have, instead of serving in a hot glass ruining the flavor and raising the temperature to 80+F degrees.

A couple of things that did not wow me as noted below but overall I thought this place was top notch. Atmosphere was lovely and our service was mostly excellent.

Wok Kampachi Ceviche app: Delicious! Sweet, savory, umami yumminess.
Tuna tartare app: This was the only dish that I would not order again. The tuna was super fresh but it came too cold and bland. If you are hoping for something akin to the tuna tartare at Morimoto's, this is not it.
Lychee martini- The first one I had was very sweet without enough tang. The second one was better. I would order again. I would suggest that the bar get some fresh lychee to garnish the drink in the future. My first came with flower petals, my second came with a dried orange slice.

Rolls:
Sindy: Excellent! Favorite roll of the night. I had never had a roll without rice before and I'm a convert. Everything was fresh and presented just right. No weird temperature issues with the crispy eel. I'm coming back to this place because of this roll.
Dynamite White Tuna - Best spicy tuna I've had.
Dragon roll - this is a standard sushi offering. Getting it here will make you happy. Quality ingredients, perfect combo.
Peppered tuna - the most understated of the rolls we had. Kind of like a tuna salad flavor. I liked the daikon. You might want to start instead of end with this roll. It did not wow me after the others I had with the bold flavors.

Small issue- No soy sauce on our table so we had to grab one from a neighboring table.

We'll be back for the Sindy!",2018-07-30 19:54:22

Aside from the very odd and unnecessary crumbled  blue cheese (which I nixed ), this was one of the best salads I've ever had.  The seafood was grilled and seasoned perfectly (scallops, shrimp and salmon) and a healthy portion of chilled crabmeat also made an appearance.   The greens were fresh and crisp and accompanied by ripe grape tomatoes, hard boilled egg, avacado  and lemon parmesan dressing which I got on the side.

Unfortunately our last trip was something else. As we entered we found a white board with the special of the evening listed. Only to be told they only had one more left. Then we went to the table and got the menus. My wife's favorite, veal Parmesan was no longer on the menu. She had to settle for something else. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs. Next we were informed they had no fresh bread and had to wait until they made some more. Then I was informed they were out of meatballs so I settled for meat sauce.

I was not expecting a ceviche dish that was listed under cold starter to be warm. Chirashi was meh. The wasabi paste had an unpleasant grainy texture and did not dissolve in the soy sauce very well.,2018-07-24 00:52:20

We were a large group (11 people), and they were able to take our reservation relatively late in the day (just a few hours before dinner).  Always so convenient for a large party.

My friend and I ordered the portobello mushroom chicken and the lobster ravioli and split the two dishes; it was probably the worst lobster ravioli I've ever had.  I'm not actually sure there was any lobster in my ravioli.  The portobello mushroom chicken was pretty decent, but the side (spinach orzo) was very blah.

Lack of giving a crap about their patrons? Who knows. So I went there with my wife this past Monday night and our waitress was definitely not on point. Right out of the gate she asks us about our time constraints, and it was about 5:30 P.M. Now I can understand this logic if it were lunch time or earlier in the day, but that is literally the first time any waiter or waitress has ever asked me this at this time of the day. I hardly get asked this to begin with.

Not that it mattered, even if we were on a time constraint, we sure as hell weren't going anywhere fast, because ""prompt service"" was clearly not in her vocabulary. My wife ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and I got a Soda and Salad to start off with. I get my drink and Salad within 5 minutes... Still no wine for my wife. She's going around attending to some of the other folks, then mentions that ""the wine is on the way."" It's one glass of wine - what the hell? I didn't ask for a bottle of vintage wine from the Manager's personal stock at his house. 10 minutes later the wine gets there. My wife doesn't want to spoil the mood so I don't say anything, but I'm very visibly irritated and it's obvious at this point.

We had ordered around the time I got my salad, and come to find out now also, what my wife ordered she is just now finding out that they are ""out of"" for the night. Wonderful. So my food is almost ready at this point and my wife is having to re-order now. No offer to comp, no offer for complimentary dessert, nothing but pure apathy. Some of these waitresses and waiters wonder why people get crappy? Interesting.

We end up getting our food - I got the Chicken Marsala and my wife did a build your own spaghetti. My food went from pretty ""meh"" to kicking my ass afterward - it wasn't spicy at all yet it felt like fire coming out.

I won't go on and on beyond this because I don't have much else nice to say. I'm very disappointed with Macaroni Grill and their staff. I usually get better than this and they really flopped hard this time. I might give them one more chance... we'll see.",2014-08-30 19:20:23

I came around noon on Sunday, which was a bad idea since the place was hopping, and I had to get my tacos to go. First thing you should know is that you'll probably feel uncomfortable here if you don't speak Spanish. Don't worry. Just relax and pretend that you're on vacation and take a look at the menu. It's pretty small compared to most places, but if you know anything about Mexican food, you'll do okay. They mostly have tacos, tortas, quesadillas, tamales, and menudo here, although with a few more things like daily specials and such. I ordered the pastor (marinated pork), lengua (hehehe, if you don't know, you don't know), and tripa. The pastor left much to be desired, especially if you've had really great al pastor before. The tripa was okay, but it wasn't what I was expecting. This was the first time I've had tripe tacos, and I didn't realize it would be breaded and crispy. It was good, but probably not to my preference. The lengua, however, was great. It's one of my favorite (real) taco meats, and it was flavorful and tender. They also had chorizo and bistek that I didn't get to try on this visit, but I'll definitely be back for the lengua tacos and to try some of the other menu items. This place is a cash-only type of place. The back cooler is filled with the typical taqueria drink offerings. I'd recommend the sidral mundet, which is an apple flavored soda from Mexico.

I keep trying to catch them straight out of the oven, but I think you probably have to ask them for that or something, because the last time I watched them bring out a fresh batch of egg tarts, and ordered it, it was still cold. Definitely still, good, I just want to try them right when they come out of the oven. I wish I knew when they baked those darn egg tarts. I'll have to ask them next time. Anyways, unlike most of the places in Chinatown, they use a flaky crust for their egg tarts. Pair that with the sweet, creamy baked egg custard filling, and it is a match made in heaven haha. Flaky crusts are the way to go for egg tarts. 

Their other buns and savory pastries are standard; taste the same to me anywhere I get them. My sister favors their butter bread though, which is very good, and can act as dinner rolls. The drinks here are ok, nothing special. They serve the standard milk tea, lemon tea, and they also have bubble tea, but I've never gotten that here. They have a few small tables for you to sit on, and a refrigerator with soda and canned/boxed drinks right by the door so you can grab and go(no five finger discount!!! Remember to pay). I've also had the lemon cake before, which wasn't bad, but sometimes I do stray from the cakes, as they don't always look fresh.

I don't think I've ever seen young people working here; it's usually 1 or 2 middle aged ladies behind the counter. They're not mean, but they're not overly friendly either. They just do their job, that's all it is. No extra smiles or small chat. And usually, there will be one or two middle aged/old men sitting toward the back reading the newspaper, making it seem more like the cafes in HK, where old people will hang out in cafes just to drink a cup of tea and pass the hours by.

Its basically a sushi restaurant, but kind of a fusion too because of the other types of food they serve. They also have a bar and I would recommend their cocktails (Geisha). As a party of 3 and we basically ordered 3 appetizers and 3 rolls, and it was definitely filling. The rolls came on one tray for us so we ate it family-styled. However, I saw tables where people had their own plates of sushi as well. 

I thought the brussel sprouts were really good, it had an asian style to it, probably from the sesame oil/seeds. The tuna tatare was served over a crispy thin cracker, which balanced out the creamy avocado and tuna. The mai fried rice was decent, just fried rice.

For rolls, we ordered the peppered tuna, white tuna, and J&J. Though the specialty roll (J&J) was almost double the price of the regular roll, there was definitely more going on and it was a lot more filling. I'd recommend getting at least one specialty roll. Still, the normal rolls such as the peppered tuna was refreshing to eat.

Even my husband, who pours salt on everything, said it was so salty he didn't have to put salt on there. Which is ok for him but for normal people it was too much.

Cons: Customer service here sucks! I work in the hospitality industry so i can understand if workers are tired and not being peppy at all times. But the guys that work here make it seem like you are a nuisance by just walking in. I went in about a week ago with my dad and 3 sisters. When we walked up to the counter, no one greeted us but just stood there and stared. we told one of the guys to give us a second to look over the menu. So after a couple of minutes i place my order and he abruptly walks away before my little sister can tell him hers. Makes my coffee and walks over to the register and waits for me to pay. So i told him my sister would like a mango juice and he ROLLS his eyes at his coworker and walks off pissed. He makes the smoothly with a bunch of banging and literally tosses it across the counter and walks off. He then asks another worker to check us out. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! she is only 12 and i can tell see how surprised she looked at the way he was acting. The funny thing is, every person after us got a hello and a way better treatment. She even asked if it was because we were the only black people in the store. Do you know how hurtful it is trying to come up with a reason why we were being treated different than the other people at the store? We ended up leaving a 20% gratuity for the other guy that checked us out because he was at least patient. I hope that redheaded cashier reads this and fixes his attitude.

My family and I used to go here pretty much exclusively for our special occasion meals, and it's a great place for dates; in fact, you'll probably see a good number of high school students there around homecoming and prom, since Alton High and Marquette Catholic are close by. So it's a busy place, especially on weekends, but I've never had to wait very long for a table - plus, since it's a small town, chances are you'll run into someone you know, and the wait won't seem as long either way. 

I can't speak to their whole menu, as I only ever ordered two items when dining there: the toasted ravioli, and the peppercorn steak. Now, toasted ravioli is touted as a St. Louis original, and indeed it's something I've yet to find outside of that little circle of the Midwest. It's not very fancy, but it *is* good: well-seasoned beef ravioli, breaded and fried, with marinara sauce on the side for dip. It's technically an appetizer, but I'm one of those people who eat lots of little meals, so it was always enough for me. 

The peppercorn steak, on the other hand, is where this place really shines. A tender filet mignon, perfectly seasoned and served medium rare with a hint of butter and herb - this is the steak that got me into eating steak. It practically melts on your tongue, try though you might to savour every last ounce of flavour. 

I wanted to give this place five stars, since relative to the other options in Alton, it definitely deserves them. I'm still convinced that the steak alone is worth five stars. I only gave it four, though, because as much as I love this place, there *is* better food out there. (Just not in Alton.)",2008-07-10 03:10:58

Mike's Ice Cream is far and away one of our favorite places in Nashville.  Both my husband and I absolutely adore this tiny little ice cream shop in downtown Nashville and make a point to visit anytime we're downtown - no matter how full we may be from our dinner or honky-tonk fun (somehow, there's always room for ice cream).  The homemade ice cream, in fun and delicious flavors, gets us every single time.  We love Mike's Ice Cream so much that we even bought 2 giant containers to serve to our guests at our wedding rehearsal dinner - and it was a huge hit!  Even the small container of mixed berry sorbet we bought for our dairy-free guests was quickly gobbled up and thoroughly enjoyed.

We love most of the flavors at Mike's, but there are a few that make the list of our ""most-favoritist ice creams of all time"".  Those flavors include:

-Take That (seriously, too delicious for words)
-Loaded Butterscotch
-Toasted Coconut
-Peanut Butter Cup
-Red Velvet

I once heard about a flavor where they take something like 6 different kinds of cake and blend them into vanilla ice cream.  I have not yet seen or tasted this flavor, but I do, on occasion, dream about it...

The only downside to Mike's is that the location makes it impossible to just stop in for an ice cream cone.  It's impossible to park on the street or anywhere close to Mike's without paying big bucks.  We're fine with saving our visits for when we're already downtown anyway, but it'd be nice to be able to stop by whenever the ice cream craving hits.

Everytime I visit my grandma, we try to go here, but I think yesterday was our last visit. (The previous time we visited, we walked out because our food took over an hour and my 4 year old was freaking out.)

My grandma had some coupons for their new ""$7 meal in 7 minutes or it's free"" so we each ordered two lunches at the counter. After about 15 minutes, we are still waiting for our food. All the employees keep looking at us nervously because they know it's been longer than 7 minutes. 

The lady who rang us up briefly says something to the head honcho chef looking man and then brings our food to us. I tell her she knows it's been twice the amount of time promised and that we want our food for free as advertised. Now, if it had only been a few minutes longer, I wouldn't have made a big deal. But it took TWICE as long. She immediately says, ""you only get it free if you are dining it. It doesn't count for to go orders."" No. I can tell right off the bat that's a load of crap so we ask to speak to the chef boss man. 

Here is a whole new problem. This man walks up to me and my 70 year old grandmother and says, ""Hi girls, what's going on?"" GIRLS? Really? What a patronizing prick. Don't you dare address my 70 year old grandmother as ""girl."" UGH. Anyways, he claims that corporate told them it doesn't count on carry out orders. I tell him to show me that on any one of their numerous advertisements. He can't because obviously he's lying. He just doesn't want to get dinged for being so slow. He says, ""Alright girls, I'll take care of it for you this time, but those are the rules."" Great, take care of it asshole. 

So while we are waiting for a refund, I look up this 7 minute express lunch deal on my phone and find that it is indeed for dine in OR carry out. I show it to him and he is immediately red faced claiming he had no idea.

First things first, I really wanted to like this place: Its in a great location in West Chester, has outdoor seating, great oyster selection, and is one of the few exclusive seafood restaurants in the area (I love seafood).

We went here in a group of 7 for my good friend's girlfriend's birthday.

Sat at the bar for drinks waiting for the rest of the party, bartender was friendly and beers are beers.

As the other people arrived we were seated immediately in the back corner.

While the waitress was friendly, she was clearly new, and not trained very well. She did not know the specials, or the drink policy of the day (let us order an unavailable drink for that day).

I ordered 2 apps, a pound of sauteed littleneck clams, and half dozen oyster on the half.

First the clams: Portion was skimpy, barely a dozen. Clams were cooked properly but were very gritty, broth was over-reduced and way too salty.

Oysters: The waitress got my order wrong and gave me 2 of the wrong kind. no big deal. But the quality of the oysters were sub-par at best. The guy shucking the oysters had no idea of what he was doing; they were mangled, i mean like he stuck the knife into the oyster, blended it, pried it open, poured the liquor out and threw it on a metal pan, with jarred cocktail sauce, and a lemon. There was barely half the oyster left. At practically $3 a piece, i was disappointed. 

I ordered the crab cake sandwich as a main. The waitress got the order wrong, and I received the crab cake entree. Sent it back, came back to me on a stale bun (the one crab cake from the previous plate), was cold, tasted of being previously frozen, and definitely canned crab meat, and now included a side of frozen french fries.

I shook my head as a got the bill and signed the $70 check (just for my food and drink).

Such a shame, this place has so much going for it, just bad management.

I will not be going back.",2012-07-10 03:55:22

Main strike:  Bland, bland, bland pasta sauces.  Four total pasta dishes were ordered amongst our party, and the verdict was the same for each:  Bland.  Uninspired.  Just... disappointing.

I had the Penne Michaelangelo which was described as coming ""in a creamy Vodka-based tomato sauce.""  Honestly, it just tasted like basic marinara to me.  I added the optional chicken breast for an additional $4.  This was dry and had clearly been pre-cooked at least an hour or so beforehand.  Total price of this dish came to $16.00. 

It rarely ever occurs to me to reach for the salt at a restaurant, but at Ricardo's I believe we all did.  Heck, I was pouring Parmesan all over mine and stirring it in.  I just kept thinking:  ""This tastes just like sauce from a can at the grocery store..""

And when you pair that lack of flavor with the price Ricardo's charges, that is where I cannot rate above 2.5 stars.

Now, the place is visually pleasing with a nice cozy environment, and the staff is friendly enough.  But if I go back to Ricardo's I will be steering clear of the pastas.",2014-01-05 02:31:47

I wouldn't go into a steakhouse, order a fish dish, then complain about how it didn't live up to my expectations.

The place looks great on the outside with a classic oyster house feel. Inside is dimly-lit and welcoming, with a warm and friendly staff. I always order a dozen of their raw clams. Clams have more taste and texture than oysters, they are absolutely divine. Then dozens of raw oysters are ordered from their ample daily selections menu. If I do order something on the side, it would usually just be fries or the peel 'n eat shrimp. Just something little, the oysters are the main attraction.

The management, however, is so clueless that I have decided to permanently give it a pass. There are so many really good places in this area where the management knows how to retain good people that one need not spend time in a place where the servers seem to change on a daily basis.

When I buy high-priced coffee, I like to have it in a real mug, not a cardboard cup that I could get at any fast-food joint. When the people here mistakenly put mine in a cardboard cup, I did not ask for a new coffee. Instead, I politely pointed it out in the hopes that they would get it right the next time. In return, I got an argument and nasty looks from the crew at the counter. Also, no matter now many people they have at the counter, they manage to keep even small groups of customers waiting on long lines.

Yesterday was the kicker. I asked for a decaf coffee and told there was no decaf. Even your average diner will usually ask a customer if he or she wants to wait while they brew up a pot of decaf. And this is a fancy café? I then asked if they had decaf espresso and was told that this too was all out.

I was not impressed, with the exception of one employee who was terrific.  I showed up for a ""tap takeover""....which was anything but.  

Grabbing a seat at the bar.... the first thing to notice was nearly the entire staff gathered at the service station and yapping to each other....never mind the customers...lets stare at our phones, show each other FB posts, and generally do anything that doesn't resemble ""service"".

Exactly 11 minutes and 15 seconds after sitting down, and finally a nice woman inquired as to whether I had been helped.  Nope, not yet !   Don't think my time banished to Irrelevant Island was wasted time....indeed...I was treated to a very entertaining display of the virtuosity of a tres cool bartender totally focusing his benevolent attention on two younger women who giggled and cooed in appreciation of his irreverent commentary and display of serious bartender mad magic skills....this man walked in front of me no less than 9 times...and I am grateful he failed to notice the guy with the red sweatshirt and giant phone....as this allowed the Flirt Show to continue unabated.  Regrettably the two young women were probably a bit disappointed when he would leave to share what undoubtedly were insanely humorous anecdotes and impossibly beneficial life changing commentary to his coworkers at the opposite end of the bar.

This was followed by a man emerging from the bowels of the restaurant with a cash drawer...who could not muster a smile or a hello to customers that presumably might fill said cash drawer.

The beer selection was typical, and fine. But hardly earth shattering in terms of variety...fewer taps than the previous incarnation. The menu IMO, showed little imagination in terms of offerings, and what unfortunately passes as acceptable food in the Midwest.  Basically nothing even remotely healthy....deep fried tacos ""Puffy"" as a signature dish in the middle of the menu ???   Maybe at a college dive bar....but for a place purportedly appealing to an ""older"" crowd....not so much.  Their supposed commitment to ""locally sourced"", or whatever similar term they use, is dubious at best.  Most items appeared to be the type that COULD be fresh off the Sysco truck and right out of the freezer.  

I was afforded further entertainment opportunities watching what few customers were in the place....attempting to flag down their servers for things like water and napkins.  Hint to all servers....if ya are bringing things like Philly cheese steaks, wings, nachos....bring extra napkins.  Don't make customers hold up their hands as if just after washing and just prior to surgery...in an attempt to keep well sauced fingers from soiling their clothing.

Nice tvs, and plenty of them, in... I believe the same locations as before....and as is fairly common across this great land of chain restaurants.  The décor is an upgrade of the previous tenant....but the weird to me.... sort of half-barrel booths in the middle of floor may be sufficiently innovative to appeal to folks looking for a bit of privacy while still enjoying being part of the action.  I however, prefer not to be ensconced, thereby not hindering my creepy ostentatious gazing of hot chicks.

Looking forward to a return visit...but...will wait for them to hopefully improve the service....and maybe some more interesting and healthier food items.",2015-11-24 13:16:24

The chef hand drawn a whole dragon with eel sauce and the  Hawaiian roll came out with flashing lights on the actual plate.

You can also ""make"" your own milkshake by taking a cup (basically filled with ice cream) and sticking it in another machine, which will then proceed to slash away at the ice cream with a couple of blades until it reaches your desired thickness.

The ambience is lovely, located in the high-ceilinged Mercer building in the warehouse district.  Charming interiors, quite beautiful furniture, intriguing wall art, Edison-era light installations and what not.  They might have the best ambience any cafe in Edmonton has.  Perfect date place too, I think, with decent music playing and comfortable furniture for quiet conversations.

I've been here twice and agree with most reviewers in that they make interesting latte creations and teas.   I think they briefly had a caramel-bacon latte which sounds really interesting and I enjoyed their salted caramel latte.  They have a collection of craft beers and wines mainly from AB and the Okanagan region.  It's interesting and I'm glad they support local craft brews and wines, though at least on the beer front, these regions are not known for the best craft brews in Canada.

Why the 3 stars? Many might consider me a coffee snob when I say this, but I actually think that for $5, it's only fair that the quality of the actual espresso be far better than something you would get at a chain coffee shop.  This, however, they lack in.  The staff seem to know very little about actual coffee and how to make a good espresso and this disappoints me a little.  It's got a bit of a yuppie feel to it without delivering a quality product.  

I am not sure if I will go back because I know of places that make better coffee. There are many in Edmonton now (Elm, Transcend, Leva, Credo, Sugar Bowl, da Capo etc.) and to open up a new coffee shop and not strive to at least equal the bar set by these establishments, especially when they charge as much (some cases, more) as these other well established coffee joints, is a little disappointing for me.

Come here for an interesting flavored latte, but don't come if you demand high quality coffee.  The main reason for three stars is that they claim to be a coffeehouse first and don't do too well, in my books, on that front.",2012-12-18 03:21:27

Set in the delightfully trendy Mercer Building alongside Mercer Tavern, Startup Edmonton and FaBLOOMosity ( a flower shop), Roast's second floor decor is comfy luxury. 

They are having some just-opened growing pains that involves installing a new transformer to handle the expresso machine but they are still open for business offering delectable breakfast and lunch options, brewed Verve coffee and some soul-changing loose leaf iced teas. 

After Friday's Social Media Breakfast at Startup Edmonton, a few of us work-tardy folks went down to sample Roast. 

Greeted right away by happy people, they won me over by spelling my name on my cup correctly without any prompts. Oh they know the way to a girl's heart. 

My iced tea was a blend of sun-kissed fields, summer promises and a splash of warm rain and my friend's no-caffeine Italian soda option was made with hugs & kisses. 

Opening at 6 am means they are dedicated to the early morning downtown set. Actually their evening hours mean that downtown just got more accessible.

Lobster roll was terrible.  Way over dressed.  Drowning in a terrible sour, runny mayo sauce.  I think the lobster was frozen, not fresh.  The lobster was diced very small.  I think all the sauce and the small cut were an attempt to cover up that it wasn't good lobster to begin with.

My husband ate only one of his scallops.  I ate only a bite of my lobster roll.  When clearing our plates, the waitress asked if everything was OK.  I explained that I didn't like the lobster roll.

Long story short, Im 23 and lost my license once so I have a duplicate ID, which understandably gives reason to request secondary identification. Bars usually will accept a credit/debit card, college ID, or have you recite your information to them, but that was not satisfactory for the bouncer here and I had to leave.

Understandable. A job is a job, and I'm all for giving second chances. He told me something with a picture and a date of birth is required, so next week I showed up with my current, valid US Passport.

Nope! Denied again. Funny thing, the bouncer said if I was a non-american he could accept my passport as valid ID.

This was upsetting cause I'm tired of going to the same bars in my town. I decided to call and speak with the owner/manager the next day. I explained my situation and asked what exactly is required for a person in my situation with a duplicate ID? She said the ONLY thing they would accept is an expired license, which I did not have, so I would not be allowed in. No passports no birth certificates no nothing.

To add salt to the burn, when I mentioned how I felt it was an unreasonable policy and will be discouraging friends from going as a result, she (the owner) said ""You do what you want, Fuck you"" then hung up.

And I wanted to go somewhere i never tried. We went on a Wednesday night around 8:15 pm. There was no wait got seated right away and the waiter was very friendly. The menu is a sheet of paper with lots of options, mostly seafood though, my favorite.

For an appitizer we got the cease and desist fries which were fries with crab and cheese fondue over them. The fries were the perfect crispiness and the fondue was a thick, semi chunky cheese sauce. it tasted like crab but didn't actually taste crab chunks at all so must have been very finely chopped up. It was different but really good.

For my entree i decided to get the fresh fish catch. you get to pick from 7 types of fish, pick the way you want it cooked and then pick the suace you want over it. I got Mahi Mahi grilled with lemon butter sauce. There was a good size of fish grilled perfectly but unfortunately i wasn't a fan of the sauce, too much lemon for me so i just scraped it off. My meal also came with mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Masked potatoes were amazing and the vegetable was cut up squash, zucchini, peppers, and snap peas cooked in some type of sauce. they were good, not overcooked.

My friend got the surf and turf with a 6 oz filet and crab cake. the filet was the perfect size and looked like it cut very easily. unfortunately she asked for medium well and it was more medium so had to send it back. The crab cake was good, i know because i tasted it lol. Her meal also came with the potato and vegetables.

Overall i think it was a great resturaunt. I will def go back. very fresh seafood, big selection. yummo!",2012-01-14 19:25:59

Cesarina Deli is a simple but nice dining location on East Bay.   While it looked like most coming in and out were there for the deli sandwich choices, they've got a few shelves of the most popular Italian grocery items.   In the deli prepared food section they carry cured meats, cheeses, olives, about half a dozen pasta choices & and some more cold salad dishes.  They also have several cases with bakery items, bread & cookies.

If you want to dine in there are tables to the left that seat ~20 or so.  But I was here to taste test one of my favorite subs, the sausage & peppers.

My order at the counter was taken fairly quickly even though there were about 5 people in line.  It was well-wrapped in foil to keep it take-out hot and I appreciated that.  And the size of the wrapped sub quickly showed that Cesarina definitely delivers an extremely large sub for the price.

But while it was still hot when I arrived home, when I opened up the foil wrap I found the sorriest looking sausage & peppers sub I've ever seen in my life.  The green peppers and onions were cooked to death in heavy oil to the point they had virtually no flavor.  The oil almost completely soaked the sub roll, and the dry portion of the roll I did manage to taste was not that flavorful and a bit tough to chew.  To top off this sad collection was the sausage link.  While I'm a huge fan of meat in tube form, and I've had many sausages in different ethnic cuisines, most all Italian sausages I've ever found have been a nice mix of  full meat flavor and spice.  But this link was the most bland taste with only spicey hot flavors.  Worse yet, the inside of the link was just ...well, just a disgusting grey color.  I'm not foolish enough to think sausages are made of any prime pork cuts, but hey, if you're going to leave out the flavor at least throw me a bone with some red dye #3 like a hot dog so it resembles something that might be meat related.   Sure, it's a carcinogen, but I'd trade that even up if at least fooled the cro-magnon portion of my meat-eating brain into thinking I was dining on something edible.

Combining the tasteless grey sausage link with likewise sad, soggy sausage and peppers, after two bites I found the entire sub completely inedible and tossed it in the trash.  And I can't think of hardly any food I've ordered in a decade or two that turned my stomach as bad as this sub.

Again, this food review is for one sandwich and nothing else.  And while this experience would normally make me write off Cesarina completely, the other reviews of the cold subs or prepared foods would not stop me from stopping by again and trying one of them.  If I do, I'll update my review and scores accordingly.

They have a nice bar and the food is decent.  The danger of sitting in the restaurant part is that you could be seated in a really weird room totally isolated from the rest of society.  Knowing this, we asked to be seated in the bar area where the atmosphere is more casual.

The waitresses were not busy and liked to avoid eye contact.  They were supernice when we were getting tables together but when it was time to order, it was like our waitress forgot that she was a waitress.  We ordered a meatball sandwich and the menu listed that you could order it as either sliced or whole, so I ordered it sliced.  Her response was, ""Uhh...what?  No one has ever asked me that before.  Let me ask the kitchen if they can do that.""  Listen lady, not only is it on the menu but all you do is take a knife and slice through that sucker like you're cutting a tomato.

We also ordered some unhealthy appetizers, I liked the toasted ravioli.  Garlic bread was huge and cheesy and meh.  I mean, everything was fine.  We wanted to order from the restaurant menu but they made a change recently that you had to order from the bar menu which limited our choices.

At the end of the meal, I gave her my credit card and asked for an itemized receipt after the fact.  The waitress said, ""Umm...I THINK I should be able to do that.""  Listen lady, you already DID do that because you ran my credit card.  I don't know what you did with it.  I admit, it's a bad habit I have from Singapore but I tell you, Singaporean waiters are shit at taking orders and mischarge you half of the time.

I digress.  Anyway, Tony's martinis are really good.  Don't order the special drink chamboise.  It's disgusting and its chalkboard advertisement should be wiped clean immediately.  I'll be back to Tony's because the fam likes it here but maybe next time I'll take my chances with the restaurant part.",2012-11-26 04:34:16

The food and friendly service carry The Pearl a long way.

You have to be seated before 5:45 in order to order from this menu. 

Our server, who was Moroccan himself recommended the chicken tagine, (which was on the early bird) and the lamb tagine, which was not.  (Note: On it's own, the tagines cost about $20, so obviously the early bird special is the way to go!)

On a street lined with souvenir shops, bars with live music, and boot shops we found Mike's because of yelp.  It's busy in here!

You can also get flavored cokes, egg creams, floats, and coffee.

The line was long the day we stopped by, and apparently it's always busy.  We were outside the door when we started waiting...but got to the counter in under 15 minutes.  The people working here are hustling and pretty darn friendly for the crush of humanity screaming for ice cream.

Like the Mercer Tavern next door Roast takes advantage of the old warehouse in which it is housed. It's spacious, trendy, and comfortable; an atmosphere well worth a $5 latte.

Roast also has some prepackaged quality food, I think from various downtown restaurants. The salads are small, but not too expensive. You can pay extra for your choice off protein (small containers of various meats or tofu). My friend seems to enjoy the baked goods.

I have not frequented this place during any hours that would be suitable for lunch or dinner so I don't have much to say about their food selections- with that being said, my friends and I are mostly found sometime past 10 when the place is pumping with some good jams and flowing with $5 fishbowls and a whole lotta college kids and or yuppies.

The DJ on deck is surprisingly up to date with the music, the bartenders are friendly and accommodating and the place is pretty spacious. One thing I noticed is that the bathroom scene is mighty intense from time to time, I once witnessed a 10+ men waiting in line for the restroom and at another time I was asked by a lovely, mostly inebriated lady to help her pull her jeans up cause ""they was too tight."" true story.",2011-07-21 03:21:31

General consensus at my table was that everyone loved their food, especially the one who ordered Manicotti. I really enjoyed the house Italian salad and the Writer's Block petit syrah complemented my food quite well. 

My only ""thing"" was that my Chicken Spiedini was... delicious... but the breading was just slightly burned and it made the chicken a bit chewy (Yikes!). Also, when being served a baked potato, its generally expected that a dish of whipped butter be served with it, however, in this case we had to open a ton of tiny packets and it got messy quick.

All of this being said, the service is not by any means sub-par. You are greeted, seated, and then treated as though you are of great importance without being pestered incessantly. They trust that you are going to enjoy your service without the need to ""perform"" for a tip. Ricardo's is family-owned and they treat you as such.

I don't know about you, but it's rare to be utterly disappointed after that. Or, perhaps you just don't let yourself be. The importance of good reception should not be overlooked!

With that in mind, I bring you my review of Ricardo's Italian Cafe. I had been drinking coffee all morning at the fabulous Park Avenue Coffee next door, but alas, a low fat blueberry muffin did not keep me sated for more than 3 hours, so come lunchtime, I checked Yelp and was overjoyed to see an Italian restaurant is located right next door. Especially because St. Louis is known to have some damn good Italian American food!

I was seated by window without even asking. Bonus points again for first impressions here! The menu has a good amount of pasta dishes, but I was dazzled by the eggplant parmesan, as is typical for me. It's offered both as a small plate and as an entree (don't quote me on this, but I believe the full size portion is offered on a lunch special).

Molto sadness: apparently due to the freeze in Mexico, there are no eggplants to be had, as I was told by the waitress. Soooo, if you were hoping to get locally sourced vegetables, well it ain't happening here (I know, I know... eggplant isn't in season in MO right now). I instead ordered the minestrone and penne tossed with garlic, oil and vegetables.

The Minestrone... I hate to say this, when I wanted to like a place so much (yes, that warm greeting really does go a long way), but it is possibly the worst I've ever had. I hate likening anything in a restaurant to store bought, but this is the stuff that Campbell's Alphabet soup is made of. Inexcusable in an Italian restaurant.

On to the main course: let's say it made up for the soup in droves. I quite possible inhaled this dish! Delicious pasta, crisp broccoli, fresh mushrooms with just the right amount of olive oil and garlic. Perfection.

The ambiance of the restaurant lends itself well to both a business lunch or a romantic dinner. There are two cozy dining rooms (you enter through the bar) and while it won't be winning any design awards, it's a familiar kind of scene that conjures up Italian American bistros across the US and I like this sort of thing. It's not garish with pink lighting and marble busts like Anthony's in Kansas City, and several notches above my beloved Milo's here in Saint Louis. 

I do think I'd return to Ricardo's when in the neighborhood. I judge most Italian American places by their marinara sauce, which I didn't get to try here. Next time! For now, though...

They had lots of options on their menu, however since we were there a little later in the day they were out of most of their sandwiches.  I got the turkey sandwich which was absolutely amazing, I loved every bite of it.  My friend is a vegetarian and unfortunately the only sandwiches they had left all had meat in them.  She opted for the chickpea salad and was not very impressed.

They're a bit pricey, but most of the other places don't serve food so they can get away with it.  I'd definitely recommend stopping by earlier in the day so there are more options available especially if you are with picky eaters.",2017-10-01 16:24:16

We were seated faster than I expected and initially thought it was strange that we were sitting at a very long table along with others. The table was separated by a piece of wood with an ax in it. It actually worked pretty well. 

Our waitress, Alyssa, was very friendly and brought us our beer pretty quick. It was the coldest beer I have ever had and it was served in a FROZEN glass not just frosted. The surface of the beer froze in about a minute. The beer was certainly a great experience.

Alyssa and the other waitresses were wearing tight tan shorts with red ""shirtinis"" (a word I just made up to mean a bikini top that has just a little more fabric to make it look like a shirt). They were for and friendly. 

The food was a mixed bag. I had the cheese bites as an appetizer. They were fantastic. My only complaint was that there weren't enough of them. My meal was  was the bbq bacon burger and fries. The fries were pretty good. They are a steak fry with a season salt. I would have liked more seasoning but my fiancé wanted less. The burger is the problem. It had great presentation and the bacon was done well but when I started getting into the burger, it fell flat on flavor. There was very little sauce and the meat didn't have a full grilled taste. I would expect a burger and fries that cost $9 would be grilled and it was obvious that It came off of a flat grill.

Delicious red sauces cooked in house, amazing meatballs, and antipasto trays to die for that included some of the best mortadela I've ever tasted. Don't even get me started on their fresh-baked Italian bread. If you're from up north, then you know real Italian bread is hard to find down here, but not anymore!

I went to the actual store today for lunch and was torn between the ""30 napkin"" meatball sub, and the Italian.  I saw someone else order the meatball, and it was offensively MASSIVE.  I imagine a fork and knife is required because unless you're a retired porn actress, your mouth probably doesn't open that wide.  The freaking meatballs are the size of tennis balls.  No joke.

I was wearing a shirt I really like, so I went the less-saucy route and ordered an Italian sub.  As soon as the woman behind the counter grabbed the bread, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to take it down, so I immediately asked them for half to go.  The bread is probably 13 or 14 inches, but it's the girth that stands out.  This ain't no Publix or Subway bread.  This sandwich was big, thick and meaty.  And just to spice it up a bit, I added Capocollo to it.  What I ended up with was the best Italian sub I've had in Florida.  A full 5 out of 5 on my Italian sub scale.

Lastly, it should be noted that this place is a market and deli store that sells a lot of imported grocery items.  There are a few tables for those who wish to dine in, but while I was there, most people called ahead and got their orders to go.  

I highly recommend this eatery!",2016-10-07 02:44:39

Interesting. The food was ""A-OK."" We had a nice bottle of wine, I had a tasty pizza, and my Italian had steak and pasta. Our calamari appetizer was a little disappointing, had clearly come from a bag and was not made in house, but we somehow managed to finish it all.

I would go to Ricardo's again because it's relatively inexpensive, has a nice atmosphere, and has food that will meet my expectations.

First the good. The food and drinks were excellent. The beer menu was a little on the shorter side, but they had a nice variety of draft and bottled beer, My wife ordered an alcoholic lemonade (the name escapes me) which I tasted and I can say it was dangerously good. We started with a half perfect storm which is raw clams and oysters crab and shrimp. It was pretty decent considering how far inland we are (although my clams were slightly gritty.) 

For my entree I got the sirloin/ crab cake combo. The steak was delicious, definitely a quality cut of meat. The crab cake was slightly bland but the sauce really helped to pep it up. The sides were excellent and complimented the food nicely. My wife had the scallops which I can say were pretty damn good (and I'm not a scallops fan.) Desserts were tasty but small we ended up getting ice cream on the way home to satisfy the sweet tooth. 

The atmosphere was really nice. It has a friendly, old-world, everything is handmade look to it, but both the restaurant and the bathrooms were very clean. The temperature in the restaurant was great (it was a very cold day) but the bathrooms were frigid. There decor consisted of old and new pictures and knickknacks and really helped to enhance the ambiance.

Now for the bad. Our server was, there's no other word for it, incompetent. We had to ask for our water and he didn't remember to get it until after our appetizer was on the table, he did not know the specials and had to go ask his manager several very basic questions about the menu. It sometimes took several minutes for him to go get us something as simple as a refill. My wife's dish was missing one of it's sides and when she pointed that out he said ""I was wondering about that"". I really think he was upset because we interrupted him hitting on the new bartender and it showed in his service.  Frankly he is the only reason that Doc's isn't rated five stars. 

Overall Doc's had great food, great drinks and a really nice atmosphere and I would go there again, I would just make sure we sat in a different section.

They have a version of mozzarella sticks that are a must try.  They're more like two slabs of cheese fried and then smothered in marinara sauce with basil and parmesan sprinkled on top.  Very good and you can use the extra sauce to dip the complimentary bread in.

The menu lacks flavor on all things but their marinara sauce.  The marinara sauce is not too sweet, not too tomatoey, not too bitter.  The fettuccine alfredo is bland and requires lots of red peppers.

The parking lot was about half filled, but it looked like a lot less people inside as the restaurant is HUGE and very open. We were greeted by no less than 6 waitresses/hostesses standing around the hostess station. The person taking us to our table, who ended up being our waitress, decided to finish her conversation she was having with the other girls before seating us. It was kind of annoying, but she was very pleasant otherwise. 

The menu isn't extensive as others have previously mentioned. I decided on the ""hangover burger"" which is your basic hamburger with the addition of a fried egg on top. It was good but I have to say I prefer the Royal Red Robin over it. The fries served with it were pretty tasty with the seasoning they added to them. My Wife decided to just get the pulled pork nachos appetizer for her meal and we would share them. WOW there was a lot of food on that plate. They were very good, but I was too full to be of much help after my burger and we barely scratched the surface. At one point the waitress came by and said, ""I was going to tell you how big they were after you ordered them.""......haha ok why didn't you? We took them home and had them the next day. No big deal. 

My favorite part about Twin Peaks, besides the obvious, was how cold the beer was! They are very proud of how cold they keep the beer as there is an indicator on the wall keeping customers informed of just how cold it was. It fluctuated from 27 to 30 degrees while we were there. While there isn't an overabundance of choices, it was super refreshing. The top of the beer had small ice crystals forming it was so cold. DELICIOUS! Especially on a 90 degree day.

I don't think it would be a monthly trip, but we would definitely take friends back for the experience or just drop in for a drink. Like I said, the inside was huge with plenty of TVs everywhere you looked. It would be a great place to take a big group.",2015-07-15 14:35:38

The Indy 500.  While thousands rushed to the track to drown themselves in alcohol in the blazing sun watching race cars zoom across the track going at speeds I've never traveled, I learned in the background.  I made a decision to go in search of a good spot to watch the race on television yesterday and that is a good thing today.  It sent me spiraling to Twin Peaks, a place I had listed on my calendar and scratched off the original day I chose to go.  Still my sub-conscious would not let me forget what I had tried to erase.  It pushed me in that direction and I arrived and met my destiny restoring the balance of today.  I walked in with a quarter.  I ordered a water and sat at the bar.  My bartender was a seasoned veteran.  She'd been there since it opened.  Her next career goal in life is to be a housewife.  I sat there for hours, just learning from the environment and her.  The pack sitting to my left get louder as their drinks keep getting refilled.  One of them speaks up and decides to order shots for the group.  I chime in, can I have one too?  No.  Then he changes his mind, calls it karma, and orders me up one.  Did we just become best friends?  No.  I soon learn what attracts me to the bartender, she reminds me of a person I knew in the past, Heather.  Coincidentally enough, a red head strolls into the bar to work next to my bartender and her name is Heather.  So I spend a few hours there just learning and being in the space.  I'm not a king.  I say at one point to the guy who bought the shots.  Kiss the ring bitch.  His response, drowning himself in booze.  When him and his pack are about to leave, he bows and kisses my hand.  

I return after a visit home for a nap and dinner.  My bartender and Heather are still there, grinding it through on a Sunday race day.  I order a glass a house red and the banana pudding.  Both were good then as of today.  It wasn't about me that good day, it was about her, the bartender, and Heather, and that's a good thing today.",2017-05-29 09:20:18

There was some sort of mix up and nobody came to our table for 15 minutes. The girl cleaning up after the lunch rush finally noticed and alerted a server. No big deal. My date had 1/2 chicken Po-Boy (minus the marinara) dressed with fries, I had 1/2 shrimp Po-Boy dressed with onion rings. Do not order a full sandwich unless you're one of those eating competition guys. They're enormous. Both sandwiches were very good, I finished the last few bites of the chicken, but wished I hadn't, so stuffed. The onion rings are lightly floured and not a typical ""onion ring"" but really good.

We had dinner reservations for 7:00 on a Friday night; however, our group was running a little late and so I called to see if we could push back our reservations 30 minutes and the hostess was more than happy to accommodate my request! How awesome is that? 

Our group arrived just around 7:30 and we were greeted immediately by a hostess. She brought us to our table and introduced our server to us. We had water on the table almost immediately and also a basket of bread was brought out right away! Our server came over and explained the menu to us and made some recommendations. I wish I could remember his name because he was really great! We placed our drink orders and then he gave us time to review the menu. 

By the time he came back with our drinks we were ready to order. I asked for a small order of the manicotti. Others at the table ordered the lasagna and I believe my boyfriend ordered a steak with a side of pasta. We also ordered individual salads for an appetizer. 

The salads came out rather quickly and I was actually really impressed that they did keep the dressing on the side as I hate when a salad is pre-coated with dressing. Our server offered cracked pepper as well as Parmesan cheese for a topping as well. While we were eating our salads our water glasses were being refilled and a new basket of bread was being delivered. 

Once we were done with our salads the meals were delivered to our table and it all looked and smelled delicious. I couldn't wait to dig in. The small order of manicotti was just perfect for me. Our server offered Parmesan cheese again and then he allowed us time to try our meals before coming back to check in on us. I could tell we were all enjoying our meals since we didn't talk much. I also think we all ate everything on our plates-this is a good sign! The meals were delicious. 

Our plates were cleared and now it was time for the dessert order; yes, I was excited to try dessert too! They had a long list of items to try including gooey butter cake, tiramisu, ice cream, and of course a cannoli. I ordered the chocolate chip cannoli and others at the table ordered the ice cream (handmade by Bailey's Chocolate Bar next door). All the desserts were fresh and I really enjoyed the cannoli. I opted to share a few bites with my boyfriend as well and I think he enjoyed it too. 

At the end of the meal our server came over and made sure we had everything we needed before bringing over our check. What I liked most about this place is that we were never rushed to do anything. It was a very laid back experience for all of us. 

Overall, this was a great dinner and I can't wait to go again! Who knew I would find such a great Italian restaurant not in the Hill? I recommend checking it out.",2013-06-19 15:42:06

2. The bread is excellent, but the cooked food is not hot.  Cold egg sandwiches and lukewarm latte are unacceptable.

3. Don't wear sandals or other open toed shoes at the inside tables.  I almost sliced my foot.  The clamps that keep the wheels on the tables from moving are knife sharp.  They need to be wrapped with insulation or removed completely.

Let me answer a question that people ask me when I said I ate there. ""Is it okay to bring your wife and kids there to watch a game?"" The servers do wear low cut shirts and shorts, but nothing that was any different than other themed sports bars. When I was there, there were groups of women together and also couples there. There were a few families with children there. 

The food is what made me give it a try....well that and the ridiculously cold beer. 

I am a big fan of nachos....good nachos. Twin peaks has good nachos, very good nachos. they are big enough for 2-3 people and be pretty full. We ate mostly appetizers while we were there. We had the sampler plate which has mozzarella bites, Fried Pickles and Boneless buffalo bites. They were really good. Even with them being fried they were not soggy from grease. Have boneless chicken instead of bone on wings in a sampler was a great surprise and was welcomed with an open mouth. I also had The cup of chili and it was very flavorful and I wish I would have got The bowl of chili instead. The food over all was above average for a sports bar. next time we might move to entrees next time.

For dessert we had the bread pudding and it was really good. I would definitely get it again. My wife are the ice cream and brownie dessert. She would get it again also. I also wanted the apple dessert they had on the menu, but the server says they don't carry it and wishes they would take it off them menu if they don't plan on carrying it.

It is my new favorite sports bar. Almost forgot they have a crazy amount of TVs and they are numbered so you can ask the server to change that tv to a game you would like to watch. They also have tvs over all the urinals in the men's room.",2015-11-04 16:52:57

Be sure to try their Italian sub (I like mine with mayo added), their meatball sub, and their mufalatta.  Oh and notice you can get halfs of all of these so be sure you and your friends get different ones to try!

The lovely party room we reserved featured great old-world Italian murals on the walls, an old upright piano, and antique low-boy dresser - perfect for the gift table!  And there was plenty of room for a large group to eat, have the Bride & Groom's cake cutting and wine-sipping ceremonies, fill out the guest-pages for their wedding-guest book, and enjoy laughing and visiting together, toasting the Bride and Groom, and just making some wonderful memories of their special day!  Ricardo's was just perfect!
  
Then the food - incredible!  Huge portions for an incredibly reasonable price.  The calamari was really fabulous - not tough at all, and fried wonderfully crunchy!  The toasted ravioli was marvelous!  Ditto for garlic cheese bread - so cheesy!  And the bruschetta was piled with delicious tomato/veggie topping!  The Tortellini Roberto is to-die-for.  The Lasagna got rave reviews.  Everything was delicious, and half-size portions on both the pasta and salad were more than enough!  Several ladies still took some home.

First the frose was very bitter. The champagne used in this is a cheaper brut which needed to be balanced with more sugary elements. Of the 8 girls that came with me no one liked their frose. I sent mine back for champagne. If you want a frose go to sambuca. 

My BYO plate is was under seasoned and poorly cooked. My eggs had no salt or pepper on them and were watery. My bacon sat in it's on grease which is not appetizing. When you cook bacon put it on something to let the grease drip off. My biscuit was the worst of all. It was hard as a rock and most of it was inedible. I tried to eat it because the  raspberry jam looked homemade and I wanted it so bad. I could not bite into the biscuit so I ate the inside layer and left all edges and crust.

Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and had a nice time.  The seafood lovers enjoyed their choices - mahi tacos, some kind of seafood chowder, a salad with four different kinds of seafood on it, and of course, some oysters.  

There weren't many choices for me and my other daughter who is a vegetarian, but we enjoyed the vegetarian linguine provencal dish that we both got.  It was yummy and chock full of some of my faves - roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives, asparagus and tons and tons of capers.  It was a nice size but for the price I would have liked to have gotten a side salad for just a few bucks more, instead of the $8 apiece we had to shell out for salads that consisted of just mixed greens, tomatoes, cukes and a few radishes. 

At $110 including the tip, it was probably THE most expensive lunch we've ever had (luckily the gift card cut that almost in half) so considering the prices, the location (a bit out of the way for me), and the fact that there are literally only 3-4 non-seafood lovers can eat there, I highly doubt we'll ever go there again.

First off, it is located in one of the best neighborhoods in St. Louis City and the surroundings only add to it's ambiance.  

I've been there for a sit down lunch and takeout.  I was a little leery looking at the menu because although I like pasta, it's usually not something I order when eating out and the only time I will is if it's some kind of spicy/cajun pasta.  The first time I went for a sit down lunch, I forced myself to order something different.  I chose a chef salad and the Elisabetta pasta.  Okay we all know what a chef salad is, but I truly enjoyed the chef salad at Ricardo's.  It was all in the ranch dressing.  The pasta was the coup de gras of my meal.  The Elisabetta was a flat pasta with cream sauce (you can choose your sauce) with shrimp, crab and clams.  The pasta was so FIRE!  The sauce was seasoned just right and mingled with the seafood and pasta noodles perfectly.  I had truly underestimated this meal.  I was more than satisfied and full with plenty of pasta leftover for dinner.  The bread that comes with the meal is not so good, but who needs it when the food is so good.  I ordered the small salad and pasta and both were very hearty servings.  If you are a light eater, believe it or not, you could share a small salad and pasta with another person.  The ambiance?  I loved the decor; lots of old world charm, but it was lunchtime and it was kinda noisy.  Noise doesn't really bother me when I'm eating out, but if it's crowded here and you're expecting to be able to hold a intimate conversation, it might be a little difficult.

Take out was also a good experience and it seemed like I got even more food when ordering the same thing as take out.  I wasn't able to get to my pasta as soon as I'd hoped and by the time I sat down to eat, it was cold and kinda gummy, but I wouldn't take any points away from Ricardo's based on my inability to eat take out in a timely manner.  When heated it still tasted good to me!",2012-03-23 03:12:43

Their regular bibimbap is $7.95 to $9.95 (veggie v. meats). If you want it in a hot stone pot (dolsot bibimbap), its $1 extra. Perks of dolsot - the stone pot crisps up the bottom of the rice which adds a great texture. However, the hot stone pot cooled quickly and I didn't feel like I got enough of a crisp on my rice. Of note, it comes pre-mixed with the sauce, which I wasn't expecting. Meanwhile, if you order the regular it does not come pre-mixed so the vegetables/meat are separated and you can decide how much hot sauce you want to mix in. For this reason, I'd probably get the regular next time.

My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken dolsot bibimbap and the vegetable dolsot bibimbap. Not the best bibimbap I've ever had. Since it came pre-mixed, it's very similar to spicy fried rice, especially since I didn't get enough crispy rice. They all come topped with an over-easy egg, the yolk of which makes a great sauce. For $9.95 and $10.95 it was a bit pricey, since the portions are not very large. We also ordered the seafood pancake, which was delicious, but again a bit pricey since it didn't taste like it was made from scratch.

Overall, lovely little spot. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it for a quick weekday lunch date, but I don't think I'd go out of my way again to return.",2016-12-03 20:59:03

Mike's.

Mike'sMike'sMike'sMike'sMike's.

Guess what day it is? Hump Day!

A very long time ago, in what seems like a different lifetime, I would travel the US in an old car, as a teenager, with the love of my life. She was twice my age, but full of energy and excitement after getting out of a nightmarish marriage that had lasted a decade and a half.

We would take turns driving, and often cross half the country in a day or night. We just kept moving, very rarely stopping anywhere for more than an hour or two. There were no rules or boundaries. No deadline or itinerary. Just movement and pure, unadulterated freedom. With emphasis on unadulterated.

Nashville was always one of our favourite places because of the energy, the nightlife, the impressive skyline, the toasty warm southern weather, the rich riverside air, and the gorgeous blonde girls driving up and down Broadway (this was pre-hipster, so not everyone had beards and vintage clothes from Etsy yet).

One night, I was too tired to complete the 3-plus-hours I still had left to get to Nashville. My darling took over at the wheel, and managed to get us all the way into Nashville without me waking up. She had a tendency to take the wrong highway and end up hours in the wrong direction, but not this time. I woke up parked in front of Mike's Ice Cream. She was nowhere to be found. Although I didn't really lift my head up off the pillow.

At first I thought she must be using the bathroom, but then I looked around, and realized I was on Lower Broadway. The night was dying down, and the last few blondes and their Cowboys (or Cowgirls, even better) were disappearing into alleys or hotel rooms or convertibles. Except that when they got into convertibles they didn't disappear, but you get the idea. Anyway.

Next thing I know, she emerges from Mike's holding a huge, shimmering ice cream cone. What could it be?

She walks over to the passenger window (it was the old days, so it was one of those that you roll down, and we were never big on AC, so it was already down), and presents me with the largest and most appreciated ice cream cone in the history of large, appreciated ice cream cones. It's your favourite, she said. Banana. In a waffle cone, no less. Oh, and here's a banana shake to go with it, she said.

She knew me so well.

Things change. Almost everything changes, actually. Often irreparably. People grow apart. Cities change. People with knit caps who only eat Korean Fusion Tacos made (and owned) by grad students who have never been to Korea, move in en masse.

But some things never change.

I still love her.

I still love traveling.

I still drive a lot, sometimes for no reason.

I still wake up in strange places.

I still love Banana Ice Cream. And banana everything.

And all these years later... far longer than I care to admit or acknowledge...

I still love Mike's.",2017-07-19 13:58:25

For entrees, they have a wide variety of seafood options to chose from. For those who do not like seafood, there are poultry and meat options as well... oh, and salads too!

We were not told of any specials or asked about wine choices. However, a larger group came in and got better service as the waitress appeared to have known the group. The place was not crowded, so I don't see why service was so bad. My guess is there was no supervisor around.  In the past I've had a much better experience.

Very perfect setting for an Instagram-worthy photo session, girls night out, romantic date night, or simple catching up with family and friends. What is very unique here is their complimentary self-serve popcorn with different spices/ flavors to add on top! 

Their main courses are also off-the-charts! I highly recommend their brussel sprouts as an appetizer! They are so crispy and the aoili dip compliments the flavor very well. I also recommend their gnocchi for any carb lovers out there! The mushroom pasta was particularly my favorite, however, my friends stated it was slightly salty. 

Their milky way dessert display was beautiful but was it worth the cash? Not really. It was okay. Very tiny cookie bites spread around a big dish mixed with assorted chocolates. I'll definitely skip that dessert and try the other ones next time. 

Their wines and cocktails are pretty cheap! And they also have half-off select wine bottles during happy hour from 3:30 to 5:30 PM. I loved the Eberle Cabernet Sauvignon. Very smooth and not too bitter.

I had the chicken cutlet sandwich. Perfect amount of spice. I wish they added more spread/sauce but the chicken was thin and breaded so that made up for it. Fries aren't really fries. More like less boring breakfast potatoes. They're whatever. UPDATE: Came back a week later and my cutlet sandwich had bacon in it and I got more than double the serving of fries. So good!

When I called to make an order for delivery I was frustrated within the first minute, the person who was taking my order sounded like they were high and what should have been a two minute phone order was almost a 10 minute ordeal. Finally got my food and was immediately upset when I opened the box of pizza and instead of green peppers like I asked for, they were red (okay okay its just a difference in color, no biggie) but also the pizza was barely warm. Weird since I only live two blocks away. Then, my boyfriend unwrapped his italian hoagie. We specifically asked for mayo plus sweet peppers and pickles, none of those items were on the sandwich. After a bite he realized instead of genoa salami they used cold pepperoni slices (in what world do italian hoagies come with pepperoni?) At this point we were both fed up so I decides to walk down the street to get my money back. I walk into the establishment, said excuse me to the man working the front counter and asked if I could speak to a manager. Maybe five minutes later a man from the back emerges and doesnt even glance at me for more than a second but proceeds to ask the person behind me what they need. I raised my voice loud enough to be heard and asked if he was the manager and he said yes. I told him the pizza was cold and the food was all wrong and instead of immediately apologizing like you'd think any self respecting manager would he tries arguing with me about my complaints. Finally after about five minutes and multiple stares from the other customers he agree to give me a full refund of my money. Not only was I upset with who ever made the food, but I was even more upset by the way this 'manager' handled the situation. Honestly I dont want to give this place any sort of good review but Ill give them 1 star ...

I work in a large office.  A number of people at the office decided this would be a great day to order lunch at Macaroni Grill and take advantage of the 2 for 1 price.  12-16 people placed orders online.  If you are in the restaurant the express lunch is $7.00 ready in 7 minutes or the order is free.  This is not true of the online ordering.  We were fine with this.  We were told by the online order the time our last order would be ready was about 20 minutes.  We arrived in 25 minutes in hopes our orders would be ready.  Long story short, they were not ready and we ended being at the restaurant 35 minutes waiting.  Lots of the food was cold, some people didn't get what they ordered and overall the initial experience was not good.  I called and asked to speak to the manager on duty.  It was Troy but he was behind the counter cooking to help get orders out.  This I could be believe because the restaurant was really really busy.
I left my name and number and asked for him to call me back.  After the lunch rush he called me back.  He was extremely sincere and apologetic.  He asked where we worked and offered to make things right.  He gave us two choices.  He would provide a family style meal or we could do a ""do over"".  I choice the ""do over"" since the whole office didn't order didn't think it would be fair to bring in a family style meal and not share with everyone. Troy give me the direct number to him and told me when he would be in the restaurant.  

Today was ""Do Over"" day.  I called about 45 minutes before we wanted to pick up the order.
Troy remembered speaking to me ( it was 6 days ago), he asked for the orders no questions asked.  I gave him a list of orders and included each person's name. He asked when I wanted to pick up the order.  I said 11:30.  One of the items we ordered were cookies.  He explained they don't always have cookies but he would see what he could do for us. We got to the restaurant and could see things were much calmer.  Our order was being put together and we were asked to have a seat for a few minutes.  At most we waited 5 minutes and we were handed three bags of food, extra dressings, cheese and utensils.  I asked the two people who presented our food to thank Troy for us.  As we were walking out, he called to us and asked us to wait a minute.  He came up to us with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies still hot and gooey.  You could tell they had just come out of the oven. I thanked him again for making this right and going above and beyond.

Thank you again Troy for turning this around.  We will definitely be back.

Went with a few friends for my birthday dinner, we called ahead to ask for an outdoor table at 7- they said they could accommodate us at 7:30. When we arrived at 7:25, they did not have any outdoor seating for us and it would be at least a 20 minute wait. We decided to sit inside. 

It was a normal dinner rush that evening, nothing crazier than normal. All four in my party ordered wine, we did not receive our drinks until AFTER our appetizers. From there on, it was even more disappointing. The server never asked during our meal if everything was fine, the manager that night was walking around and was going to every table but ours to see if they were okay. We waited for about 10-15 minutes with out empty dinner plates in front of us until our server finally came back around- where we were able to order only our second drinks. At the end, we said something to our waiter of how disappointed we were. His response was that there was not enough wine glasses that night. He never got the manager to come over and to talk to us. 

Two of us were/ are servers and it takes a lot for us to complain. With drinks being that late, the server should have told us about the shortage of glasses AND should have had a manager come over to talk to us.

We came in shortly after they opened to beat the rush, and we were sure glad we did: the place was full half an hour later. We picked where we sat, which was two rooms over from the front door, away from the all-too-sunny window. 

The menu was a special one for the house tour and probably more limited. I still found two things on a single page that I wanted: cheese manicotti and capellini pomodoro. It was a rough decision, but the manicotti was recommended as more delicious as I would have asked that the capellini not come with a meatball. It was only $7 for a half order and that included two manicotti. That's a pretty good deal, even for a lunch special, so I went all out and ordered a house salad too. I think the dressing was a red wine vinaigrette. Normally, I'm not all over vinaigrettes, but this wasn't so strong. The cheese was Provel (yay!), and even though it wasn't overly cheesy, the salad was still good, and I think I'll order it when I return for the capellini. The manicotti? Delicious! So soft that I nearly slurped them up whole! Everyone else in my party ordered salted caramel ice cream for dessert and enjoyed it. (I was saving room for the free ice cream on the tour.)

Why are they using paper and not real China? It's bad for the environment and made my $10 meal look like a $4 mall food court item. My friend ordered the omelette with whole eggs and grits as the side. Hers looked exactly like mine like it came from an ""As seen on TV"" rubber mold and she had grits on the side. Also she said it was bad. Our other friend ordered the quinoa bowl and mid way through stopped eating it and asked her why, she said they haven't cooked one or two of the vegetables they are still raw and it's not good. 

The service is lackluster, I ordered a side biscuit (which by the way was not good) they don't bring it with butter or jam you have to request it and they send you to wait in the line at the bar for it again. They also aren't friendly the people bringing you the food not the ones at the bar those are super nice. Their water was out so we had to wait for them to refill and that took forever. 

Would recommend going to see the place, order a coffee and pastry, sit and enjoy the space but don't go for a meal.",2017-08-02 03:09:13

I came to this location after my work shift so it's a little after midnight and regardless, this Wawa was packed. I only wanted a hot latte so after putting in my order I braved myself to stand in the line, which only had one cashier and was at least 12 people deep because everyone had to buy their cigarettes. That could be a whole different review, but the cigarette buying process is an endeavor in itself.

My latte was made fairly quickly and the line had not budged so....whatever, I leave my place in line to pick up my drink and go back and wait. The surly drink maker looked at me like I had roaches coming out my eyes when I went up to her and asked if this were my latte, can I just have it while I wait in line, so nobody mistakes it for theirs and takes it?

I know the Wawa rules but it wasn't like I was gonna book it out the door as soon as I got my $3 coffee. Instead, this lady does not give me the coffee and rudely tells me ""why don't you go back and wait in line"" with such a nasty attitude it took all my might not to tell her to f off. 

So I waited in the long time. While I was waiting, a guy went up to the coffee counter, looking a little confused, and took my latte off the counter.

I'm not dealing with this. I left the line and went over to the 38th street Wawa. Had my coffee and out the door within 5 minutes. 

Anyway like I said, I knew the rules and ""broke them"" but really, I don't look like a thief. This place just ain't great with customer service and the lines are always long.",2016-02-04 13:48:50

I had the barge. Only because I wanted to try the shrimp, oysters and catfish. The hand cut fries were cooked to perfection And tasty too. 

The shrimp in my opinion needed to be soaked in milk to get rid of the iodine taste. It was cooked perfectly, the breading was just right. It could just be me and my taste buds. I have had shrimp that doesn't have that iodine taste and prefer it that way. 

The catfish was great  as were the fried oysters. 

I know it said barge but I really didn't expect the barge to be as big as it was. Two could defiantly share this one. As there were ample fries too.

Looking at the menu beforehand, I was prepared for a mediocre experience.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere was great for a date.  I would say this is an excellent place for a business lunch or dinner, too.  We had an opportunity to sit and chat with the owner while waiting for the other couple, then for four of us had a drink at the bar and continued the conversation.  She was very friendly and helpful - obviously willing to do whatever it took to make our visit enjoyable.   

The menu is pretty standard Italian.   We had Lasagna, Cannelloni, Chicken Parmesan and Eggplant Parmesan.  All of the appetizers looked fantastic and the two I tried were great.    A big plus here is they have two sizes for their pasta dishes.  The smaller size is just right for most people and most are priced UNDER $7, so it's an amazing value.  Red wine by the pour was from $6 to $8 - very reasonable for a nicer restaurant, and the pours were very generous while not so full that you couldn't swirl the wine. 

One complaint that keeps this from being a five:  the house salad was only okay - light and vinegary with not as much cheese as we would like.  

A big bonus of eating here is that Bailey's Chocolate Bar and 33 Wine Bar are on the same block, so you can visit either for an after dinner drink or dessert.

2 people (1 kid and me)

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4 stars
Service - 3 stars

Background - Been here many times in the past but do not remember how long it has been since the last visit, more than a year easily.

Atmosphere - Dimly lit restaurant chain with a rustic ""Italian"" feel.  The restaurant was full and half of the customers were prom goers.  While waiting to be seated I just my daughter the cart of logs being hauled in, which led to the conversation about the wood oven they have in the corner of the kitchen.

Food
Appetizer - The free bread they provide before the meal was piping hot, the steamed poured out after pulling it apart with my hands.  The second loft served during the meal was the same way.

Dinner - I had order the Roasted Chicken Cannelloni.  The cheese filling was excellent.  The sauce was not too sweet, just right, but there could have been more.  I would have loved to dip my bread into the sauce.  The chicken had little to no flavor; it could have been very firm tofu.  I would have preferred that the cannelloni be served on a plate instead of a flat wide bowl; it just made the use of a fork a little challenging, as the bowl served no purpose to hold anything in.

Dessert - We skipped this as I had planned on another location for this treat.

Service - The hostess indicated that was a small wait as they were cleaning and prepping the table, not an issue as I was expecting a wait.  A minute later she indicated that she was ready.  While walking to the table half way there we had to turn around as the table was not ready.  When we did get there the table was set up for four people, strange.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  My daughter received an adult sized beverage, I figured she was getting older, so I was comfortable and did not send it back even though she order from the kids menu.  So the bill arrived and her drink was on the tab, as it should not be as it is part of the kid's meal.  They charge $2.20 for a glass of Sprite, really?  I brought this up to the waitress, she looked at the bill and then the class quickly, and instantly she knew what happened.  She indicated that I was correct, and in less than a minute it was corrected with a new bill.",2011-04-05 02:00:34

One of our guests doesn't drink and the bartender prepared her a delicious alcohol-free mixed drink upon request. All the food was outstanding, but the Brussels sprouts were the best thing I ate - the sauce was SO flavorful and just a little sweet. My only complaint is how the dining area is laid out. I'm no expert on this matter but as a party of 4 our only table choices were right in front of the entrance, or at a small round table oddly wedged in a corner.

We had made reservations in advance and were seated in what I think is the best table of the restaurant - a small table just for two by the window/glass doors. The weather was nice so they had their sliding doors open in which you could feel the breeze and the environment from the outside but also feel like you were part of the upscale dining environment in doors. From either end of the table you got views from the restaurant and from the outside which I thought was magnificent. 

The restaurant per say is beautiful, it has very chic. modern and elegant decor. They have leather booths and small tables and a nice design throughout the restaurant. The music is audible but not extremely loud that disrupts your conversation. 

The service was also very good and our waitress was very pleasant. 

As for the meal everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We tried the shishito peppers which were perfectly seasoned and the fried Brussels sprouts which were also perfectly crunchy. For our main course we ordered both the Fishtown and Old City sushis and they were SO SO GOOD I'm still dreaming about them. The desserts were also good but not mind blowing (this was the only ok part of our meal). We tried both the Green Tea and the Tree Cake and they were traditional Japanese Sponge Cake which was very good but not exactly what we were expecting as our dessert. 

Our glasses of wine and proseco were also very good - I just wish they offered half bottles at a more convenient price. 

Bottom line is, If you are in old city and looking for a place to dine don't think about it twice.",2018-05-26 12:40:54

The staff was friendly but unhelpful in trying to pick dishes to fit our tastes. Though I'm not sure it would have helped. We tried 6 dishes. The first was basically cold potato salad, pretty much the same as I could pick up at Kroger. The dumplings were bland and flavorless, the curry udon was basically a bowl of mush, and while the trout was good, it could have been trout from any southern restaurant and didn't ring of Japanese flavors at all. The only dish that we enjoyed that had the expected flavoring was the Broccolini with rock shrimp, which was pretty good. 1 for 6 isn't great.

The drinks were fine but not particularly special at 14 bucks each. The waitress described the atmosphere as a neighborhood Japanese pub but it's just another upscale dining establishment in a town full of them. The ambience or atmosphere is the same as any other in town.

Overall, it was not a terrible meal, but not really a good meal either. Just kind of a dud (and an expensive dud at that) in a town full of much better restaurants. We probably wont return.",2018-12-22 21:21:53

We had the tuna tartare & wagyu egg rolls to start. The tuna tartare was delicious- very refreshing & the flavors were amazing. The egg rolls were good- nothing too out of this world but still very tasty. 

We also ordered the Fishtown roll, salmon/avocado rolls & the peppered tuna roll. The Fishtown roll is just the right amount of spice to it. The avocado in the roll was creamy and delicious. I wasn't a fan of the peppered tuna roll but my boyfriend really liked it. 

A few rounds & a few rolls will cost you a few dollars, but definitely worth it for a night out with loved ones.

The place was always standing room only and it was a super treat to go. Over the years this is the place that my family would always go when we got together in Alton. Over the last several months I have been in town quite a bit and have been to Tony's no less than six times in two months. However, every time I go I feel worse about the decision. While the pepperloins are still top-notch I cannot say the same about other items on the menu. The veal is pre-breaded frozen patties and tasted like it was over-cooked after being freezer burned. The spaghetti was cold and over-cooked. The pizza used to be the best anywhere around. For some reason they have changed the crust and now is just so-so. The staff, while usually friendly, are inexperienced and in 6 trips in two months we have never seen the same waiters. Not sure why there seems to be such turnover, but this prevents them from knowing the basics, such as what brands of alcohol are available.

Perhaps the biggest shock here is the recent attempt of Tony's to change the menu format. The create your own pizza/pasta gimmick is not the tradition that I have come to love from this restaurant. 

I will not go as far as to say I will not go back, as I have long loved this place and hope they will return to their former traditional ways.",2015-07-29 01:14:37

I had the spaghetti with meat sauce which was pretty decent. It was a homemade sauce with lots of meat and even chunks of real tomatoes in it. The sauce was not sickeningly sweet and actually tasted pretty decent.

The bread was fresh on the table and the cold antipasti was excellent. Salads were fresh and not from a bag and the dressings were decent.

A loud atmosphere inside and the crowding of the tables inside would be the only downfall. Also, they sat a party of four at a table that at most could fit 2 comfortably.

Service was decent, but not exceptional. There were times our table of four was ignored but drinks seemed to be refilled on a regular basis. Hostess staff was not impressive and seemed to be bored or uninterested and seemed to spend most of the time flirting with the waiters as they ran their tickets next to the host staff.

From my two local Tucson natives, this location is better than the one on Broadway I believe.

I wanted this to be a 4* review but due to the few shortcomings it will have to remain at 3. Not good for groups due to the small, crammed together tables and relatively few booths.

This place is what local legendary places is all about and what Yelp has helped me to discover.  The atmosphere in this area of town is great, somewhat, touristy, but authentic.  The place itself is about as big as a chicken nugget, but the place itself is clean and well organized.  Not only is this fantastic ice cream, but also a full fledged coffee shop with all of the foo foo drinks you could want.  They have some neat little displays and murals on the wall.  One is a fountain that looks as if it's poring into a soda glass from the soda fountain mural.  Quite inventive and cute.  They also have their own T-shirts for sale as well with their famous logo and location of Nashville, TN. I bought one.

Finally, the ice cream itself here is great.  It's not too frozen so it melts while you eat it tastes better.  Doesn't have any of that freezer burn smell or taste to it.  They also have some pretty crazy flavors, including a banana flavored one that went fantastically with a scoop of chocolate.  From what I understand, the ice cream is hand made, and you can taste the quality of the ingredients.

I've eaten at Caviar & Bananas in Charleston, and we had the most amazing sandwich! Their ingredients were fresh, the menu well thought out and even better prepared, and staff was sharp and knowledgable.

At this new Nashville location though, I was missing those things.

The location, layout, decor and ambiance of the restaurant gets an A+, it's one of the nicest in Nashville. But the food, was sadly very disappointing. 

The sandwich we got had Arugula, Egg, Turkey and some other stuff, and it looked amazing... but it had weak and cheap tasting bread, and cheap tasting Turkey. I'm not sure what they use, but it was very disappointing and reminded me of cheap packaged deli meat... especially for the price this was a shock. We also got avocado toast which reads great on the menu, but again thin / cheap bread and an old (dark green) avocado spread that didn't taste fresh at all. We love Avo toast! So this was a bummer.

We also got a Quinoa Kale Veggie Breakfast bowl, but the overall taste of the quinoa and veggies was slightly undercooked and the ingredients weren't prepared to compliment each other. The eggs on top were fine... The staff was very sweet, but wasn't sure what one of the items in the dish even was... they did refund the dish after I talked with them about not enjoying it all, which was awesome. Then i ordered the recommended Chicken Biscuit instead, and it was unfortunately worse. The cheese tasted cheap, the scrambled eggs were soggy, and the chicken was thin and soggy itself, which was crazy. I was actually so surprised because Nashville is a great Fried Chicken town and this was the worst piece of Chicken I've had here... A $3 Chicken biscuit from Chic-Fil-A or Zaxbys would have been much much better taste and better quality chicken (I know, strange)... and this cost $10. Also, I ordered it with Parmesan Potatoes which might have been okay but sadly they came out cold and not fresh... like they had been sitting on a counter for 45 minutes... 

We did order a croissant with strawberry jam and it was amazing! So props there... 

For what this place could be, it has a lot of improvement to make. They have a great foundation, beautiful space, sweet people, and awesome croissants... they just really need to up the game on the quality of the food! And please do!

Which makes it all the more surprising that this Wawa has a lowly 3.5 star rating... Even more surprising yet is the fact that a couple of the 3 star reviews actually seem fairly laudatory.

I find that there is very little not to like about this Wawa. Yeah, they could stock a few more cereals and I really wish they carried Double Stuf Oreos, but they can't have everything... Because then they'd be a grocery store. 

I also wish that I didn't order gross sandwiches while drunk so often, but that's not exactly their fault... Though perhaps they should consider adding a confirmation page that asks, ""Are you sure, dummy?"" when you order something greasy and gross between midnight and 4am.

We started with the pork gyoza and fried oysters. When we asked our server how many oysters came in an order, she said 2 per order. We ordered two so that all of us could try an oyster. When the plates came out, there were three gigantic oysters on each of them. So, we really didn't need to order 2 at all. The oysters were OK, nothing special. They mostly tasted like breading. The gyoza were disappointing. They really didn't have much flavor and tasted basically like plain ol' pork sausage.

The actual sushi itself was really good, though. I got some salmon sushi, a yellowtail and chive roll with scallion oil, and a spicy tuna roll. I loved the sushi - it was so tender and melted in your mouth. I also can't say enough good things about the yellowtail/chive/scallion roll. It was...really unique and delicious. I would definitely order that again and advise that you try it for yourself!

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here. I thought their cocktail list left a lot to be desired and that the price for everything was too steep for what you actually got. While I won't be making any grand effort to return, I wasn't dissatisfied with my meal here.",2018-01-29 13:40:05

We arrived at about 7pm and were quickly seated. We then had to wait over 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. When our waitress arrived she was frazzled,(not fault of her own). We asked for a manger and quickly Troy, the kitchen manager, arrived. He instantly stated our wait was unacceptable and took our order immediately. He made us laugh and made us feel important. He instantly went and put in our order and consistently came back with our food to ensure our service was prompt and delivered with a smile and friendly attitude. Troy is the definition of what a great manger is. He made sure that the guest was completely satisfied and that the staff was supported. I'd come back for no other reason then Troy.

Nice modern restaurant in Old City located on the main floor of a condo building. Service was excellent on both my visits. You can take your time and enjoy the meal, have a drink or two. Nice laid back atmosphere.

A few appetizers stood out for me - Wagyu beef spring roles, Seaweed salad, Sashimi salad and I loved the Grandmom's wonton soup.  

The Tuna Bar is at its best serving fresh sushi / sashimi.  I was with larger groups so got to try many of the house rolls which were mostly good but I was happiest ordering from the Sushi A La-Carte section of the menu. The fish was incredibly fresh and not the same boring pieces (i.e. Salman, Tuna, Ebi etc....) served at the 100+ sushi restaurants in Philadelphia.   

Loved the variety of fatty tuna options (Toro and Otoro but no Chutoro when I was there - different options available depending on the day), 1-2 Uni choices, Maguro, Kampachi, Striped Bass, Hamachi and Unagi.  

If you want above average sushi options / quality, give the Tuna Bar a try. Prices are above average but to be expected given the variety and quality.

Penn State reunion at a friend's housewarming party in WC. Daylonging beforehand, and finally making it out to the bar around...9pm? 10? Umm...

This place smells like fish when you walk in. Or, rather like a fish tank that needs a good scrub. Upstairs bar = much better. Apparently the thing to get here is Fishbowls, which is basically one of those plastic fishbowls (imagine that.) filled with liquor and mixers. They remind me of the fishbowls at Bar Bleu in State College. My only issue is, just like at my favorite Penn State bar, you are  likely to get diabetes following consumption of this concoction. The blinking lights everywhere was a nice touch.

I ended up ordering Diet Cokes and water here though, since the last thing I needed at this point was more booze. However, just because I don't need something, doesn't mean I didn't want it....

The bartender was a bit rude, as if she was rushed to give us our beers when the bar was not really that busy. When we sat to drink them I quickly noticed why. She was busy dancing, singing, and shaking her butt in an attempt to get a good tip from two men who were there.
I understand when a bar is busy and buzzing you may have to flag down the bartender to refresh your drink. My company wanted another beer and instead of being aware of the patrons she waited over 5 minutes to get her attention to get another beer. Ridiculous. She acted as if it was a bother to have to do her job!
I hear the food here is great. I do plan to go back at least one more time to try their food. Hopefully service will be better this time.
I also noticed how unkept the woman's room was... Sure, people write on the walls and it's an adult establishment, but I would embarrassed to own a place with such awful things written ALL over the stalls in the bathroom. Not to mention there was toilet paper all over the floor and it seemed a bit dirty. On a busy night I can understand the bathroom being overlooked a bit, but not one employee stepped into the bathroom the whole time we were there to even check if it needed to be cleaned a bit. It made it seem that this is the norm. I'd hate to have to be there on a busy night! I couldn't imagine how gross it gets when it's actually busy if thats what it's like when it's not. 
It was also a cold, icy night when we visited and the parking lot was very poorly salted. There were give ice spots near and on the walk way, as well. Very dangerous, especially with inebriated people leaving. I wouldn't be surprised if someone falls and gets seriously hurt one day. If the owners are reading this please do a better salt job in the winter months. People are sue happy now a days.
Thumbs up for use music. I have to say it was a decent variety and more to my taste. No hip hop/rap. Stuck to the classics and that was the best part of my experience there.
I'm hoping when I try again things are better. If so, I'll change my review, but for now 2 stars is where it stands.",2015-04-14 13:58:57

The hostess wasn't that friendly and didn't seem to be happy that we were there.  Always a good start....

There are more BIG TV's than any place I've ever visited.  There are almost too many if that's possible.  It was a little annoying that even though all of the TV's were the same size and model they couldn't sync the color adjustments so it made for uncomfortable viewing.  At least the feed was all in sync timing wise.

Our server was very attentive and friendly  I ordered the fish tacos which were very good and my wife had the meatloaf which she also enjoyed.  I had a few draft beers which were quite cold.  I didn't really like the frosty mugs though.  They had too much frost and I ended up with a lot of ice in all three of the beers I ordered.

The other servers that walked by seemed to be going through the motions and were never smiling.  They really made it kind of an uncomfortable environment.  I think if they would smile a little it would go a long way to making the place more enjoyable.

Overall the place just seems too large and not the kind of place I would like to hang out and watch sports.  If you advertise cold beer why does it have to come in an icy cup.  It kind of ruins the beer when there is that much ice floating in it.",2016-01-13 15:14:16

I had high hopes for this restaurant based on reviews and photos on Instagram. As I walked in, my party was not formally greeted and there was no direction for seating. I found a worker that led me to the hostess stand, but there was no hostess available. As I waited, its clear the establishment did not have a functional system to handle walk-ins and reservations. Also, it's very unprofessional to leave the hostess stand unattended for long periods. It's understandable to be swamped on a Friday night, but there needs to be more efficient communication within the waiting area. Overall, we stood confused for about 15 minutes waiting for a directive. Finally, the hostess arrived, and we asked for a table for two. At 7:30 PM, she said they were completely booked until 9:45 PM. I told her to put my name on the list for 9:45 PM, and headed to my vehicle. However, I looked on Open Table, and they had a reservation for 7:45 PM. This was purposefully not communicated to us by the hostess, and we were essentially lied to. We made the reservation for 7:45 PM and went back to the lounge. Although we had a confirmed earlier reservation, they still hesitated to seat us because they were ""confused."" While they were ""confused"" they still sat other people who had reservations at the same time or after us. I felt as if we were treated unfairly with major hunts of racial stereotyping and bias .

Apparently a mistake was made so he said he would rush out another order.  20 min later a server comes out with a flatbread and wanders ultimately placing the flatbread on the large table of 20+ and I can hear them asking among themselves who ordered it?.......well no one because it was ours. So I flagged again and told it would be rushed again and yes, 20 min it finally arrived. And well it was underwhelming at best. A flatbread is a simple square/rectangular pizza on a thin crackery/crispy crust. How do you mess that up?  Was bland. We just finished up and left. We were there to enjoy some wine on a Friday evening so we stayed for that reason. Then it just became comical. I don't believe we will be returning anytime soon.",2018-09-22 22:50:01

Sorry for the dramatics . It's just hard for me to find good Sicilian pizza in the Tampa Bay Area so I get all excited. 

Pizza was very good , thick crust good crunch not overly doughy. 
Sauce was actually balanced well not overly sweet nor acidic.   An abundance of well distributed creamy mozza not overly oily either.  
My only small critique would be I would like more garlic in the sauce.  
I'd put them in my pending top 5  best Sicilian , pending on account I will revisit it and see if they are consistent with quality and taste. Yes I take pizza that seriously!

Super bonus: they have shrimp and grits on the menu! I am giving the place a 3.5 stars just because they have only been open about a month and they are still working out some issues.

We were here for lunch and there was a good crowd, but it wasn't packed. They have a pretty diverse menu with things like fried catfish, shrimp and grits, pasta and even lobster. I decided to be less predictable this time and I get the corn and crab bisque and the fried catfish Lafitte lunch special which came with sausage jambalaya.

The waitress brought out my entree before my corn and crab bisque. I had intended the bisque to be my appetizer, but I guess I should have mentioned that, The catfish was interesting. It was topped with red sauce (which the waitress mentioned ahead of time) and it was fried nicely. The jambalaya was okay, but didn't really dazzle me.

The corn and crab bisque was just okay, as well. It didn't taste the way other bisque I have had in the past tasted. I don't know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. My dad got the shrimp and pasta and wasn't that into it either. He was so not into it that he let me take his leftovers home so I could eat it later. When I tried it, all it was was flavorless pasta and overcooked shrimp- disappointing.

Our waitress was beyond sweet and made sure that we were happy with everything. Like I said, this spot has only been open a month so I expect them to work out the issues and do okay. One suggestion: you offer an entree of shrimp and grits for $19; I would love if you would offer an app size for maybe half that price.",2016-09-15 18:37:46

Apparently that did not  mean much although he did bring me my bill before my forgotten food even came out! And I was somehow charged a 20% tip as a default for my forgotten order before I even got my main course when I was planning  to leave cash tip. Thankfully I noticed it before I tipped double on severely neglected service and subpar food. 

The food was not good. The beet salad although sorta pretty came out filled with morose chunks of beets that could have choked a cow. But HEY the underlaying sauces made it look pretty...although didn't really help the taste. They should really add some greens as a base and ummm carve the beets into something a human could choke down. 

Then the main course which was a flatbread margarita pizza took 40 min after the salad. Obviously forgotten the pizza came out cold and slopped together on the fly. Obviously waiter error and he would not acknowledge it. 

WINE BAR: To top it off their wine selection by the bottle is severely overpriced  and the tap wines by the glass ...up to bottle are basic and uninteresting.

I decided to have some of their fresh roasted coffee along with the Bacon, Cheddar & Egg Biscuit sandwich.  The menu doesn't do it justice: this is a gourmet sandwich, complete with a friend egg, bacon, cheddar cheese, greens, tomato, and a delicious tomato roulade that has a slight little kick in to to wake up the taste buds.  

The sandwich is so tasty, with a wonderfully baked fluffy biscuit and a portion definitely big enough beyond a breakfast bite.  

The decor is simplistic.  Rustic tables with a quiet outdoor patio, and several large shared wooden tables inside.

My wife had the whole wok fried trout.  The food was well prepared and good presentation.  Liked both of my dishes and the trout was firm but not overcooked.  My wife felt that it needed more flavor and asked for salt which helped.  The trout dish needs some type of side sauce (hate to say tartar but perhaps an Asian version with wasabi/ginger) to dip. Would return.  Menu is a little confusing and does not describe certain dishes as ""small plate"" but the menu is arranged from low to high price with about $19 being the dividing line.

Gluten-free pasta? I never knew that existed in any restaurants. Apparently that was my friend's reaction too when she saw it on the menu. I don't know much about the gluten allergy other than what she has told me. Basically what it boils down to is -- if she eats any wheat products, it kills the lining of her stomach. Eww...... needless to say she was pretty friggin' excited.

4 of went. Seated upon arrival with our reservation, our server was a bit slow to getting to us and our orders. I don't remember her name or much else other than we didn't get served as promptly as we would have liked with our first order of drinks or our food orders until about 15 minutes of us being seated. I thought this was a bit ridiculous considering we didn't even get our waters immediately either.

After our long wait, she brought  out our complimentary bread and to take our orders. I decided on the half portion of their Tortellini Roberto aka doughnut shaped pasta stuffed with pork and chicken in a cream sauce with peas and ham. Delish. Also, a spinach salad with mandarin oranges,walnuts, red onion which I had removed, and a raspberry - balsamic vinaigrette. The salads are not included in the pricing with the pasta dishes, however if you order an entree, it is included.

The fact the salads are not included really doesn't make a whole lot of difference. The half portions and full portions are all so decently priced and it is so good! I recommend getting a half portion of the pasta and a salad to accompany it if you are on a budget and want something filling. 

I was so surprised on how cheap the pasta dishes were! Nothing is over $13 for full orders of the pastas, and just like I did, you can order a half salad and half order of pasta and leave with satisfied without feeling like you broke the bank. Once you get into the entrees that is a different story. You are going to be in the $20-$30 price range. Ultimately, you can spend as little as $6 on a fulfilling meal or you can wine and dine as if it's a upscale restaurant and leave with a $50 tab. I love how it suits to all wallet sizes.

We waited a long time, yes, but I give this place 4 stars for the ambiance, accommodating menu prices, and multiple pasta and mix 'n' match options. Perfect for family night or date night. Again, kudos for the gluten-free options!",2011-10-25 05:23:04

They have these crackers with seeds (as I like to call them, they're actually lavash), garlic scented cheese whiz (I honestly think this is what it is, pressed into a little cup), and butter waiting for you at the table when you arrive.  

I actually like that part b/c I like to eat before I eat.  I always seem to be starving by the time I get to any restaurant, so crackers w/ seeds are nice, not too heavy like thick white bread.  The cheese whiz, I could do without.  Try this and tell me it's not cheese whiz in a cup.  I dare you!

I ordered the goat cheese salad and the crab cake appetizer.  They were alright.   The crab cake didn't have a good sauce (sauces are incredibly important to me), but the taste was okay.  It didn't make me sick, so that's a plus, right?!

The goat cheese salad was decent.  I thought it would have crumbles of goat cheese on it, but it came out w/ 2 lumps of fried goat cheese.  I will quote Padma from Top Chef, ""They could fry my toe and it would taste good."" They were good, but SO heavy and SO rich I couldn't eat both of them and they weren't all that big.  

Now that I'm complaining, I may as well get it all out there.  Where was the salad dressing?  Where was it I ask you?  I detected hints of a dressing here and there, but no real sighting of the dressing was ever made.  I don't want to eat leaves alone.  Okay, there were some carrot curls on top, but mostly leaves.  I want to eat salad dressing with some leaves in it.  Oh, the salad is NOT big or medium either.  It's small. 

Here's why I can give it 3 stars:  Our waitress was really friendly and I'm finding that to be like winning the lottery here lately.  The prices are good.  Cheap even.

It was a beautiful day and there was outdoor seating available, but they also take away part of the wall to the inside to merge some of the outdoor seating with the in. 

Now on to the food. All in all we ordered Grandmom's wonton soup, the Soba Noodles, and the Wentz, Sindy, Rittenhouse, Dragon, and Spicy Scallop Rolls. Everything was delicious! Now we're no Japanese cuisine experts but my boyfriend said that was the best wonton soup he's ever had. The soba noodles were very flavorful and tender and all of the rolls were to die for. Every roll was unique and delicious but we agreed our favorite was the Sindy roll. Instead of it being wrapped in soy paper or seaweed it's wrapped in thinly shaved tuna. Something we had never seen before. 

My boyfriend had only casually mentioned it was my birthday in front of the host but the host was keen enough to pick up on that so the chef made us a small raw fish appetizer that was to die for and since we hadn't saved room for dessert our server, Dori, brought us over two small dessert drinks before we left. Very thoughtful and sweet on everyone's part! 

P.S. This spot is also an easy and quick walk from the waterfront.

Hubs used to live in Edmonton and knows the city fairly well so after reading some great reviews I knew we needed to seek it out.  As the name implies Roast is both a coffeehouse and wine bar.  They are however separated into two unique spaces.

Immediately we loved the ambiance and decor of the coffeehouse.  Spacious & Airy it felt very comfortable.  The staff behind the counter were uber friendly and helpful.  They alone deserve 5 stars each for outstanding customer service.  They were chatty and very accommodating with our kids which also impressed us.

We picked up a few items to try, the cookie topped doughnut, maple bacon cinnamon bun, cookies and a pain au chocolat.  Also indulged in some hot cocoa (kids), a cappuccino for me and hubs tried the salted caramel latte.  Everything was heavenly but the salted caramel latte was the big winner for me and well the maple bacon cinnamon bun for hubs (anything with bacon, right?).  They also had a Bacon Latte on the menu but were out of the candied bacon so we didn't get to try (this time).

The next day we stopped in on our way out of town.  The same friendly peeps were working behind the counter and remembered us.  We picked up some more goodies and coffee (this time I got the salted caramel latte - heaven) and left a very satisfied family indeed.

After making the reservation and realizing we weren't able to preview the prix fixe menu, I decided to contact the restaurant since my boyfriend has a shellfish allergy and this can often be a problem with sushi. I called, no answer. So I messaged them via Facebook. I explained his allergy and asked if this would be issue with the menu and their exact response was ""...confirmed with management and there will be no shellfish on tonight's menu..."" (See pic) 

Great, so we went. As soon as we sat down and looked at the menu we realized almost half of it included shrimp aka SHELLFISH (see V-day menu pic). Now maybe they were unaware that shrimp is shellfish? Or maybe they were just too lazy to actually check when I inquired, but either way, it's pretty inexcusable to ignore someone's food allergies and risk a health scare. What if we had asked if a dish included shellfish and my boyfriend had eaten it due to their ignorance? We would have ended up at the hospital. 

I'm giving three stars because our waiter did his best to accommodate us once we were already seated and expecting a decent meal. The sushi roll  that he subbed for the 6th course (didn't have a name, his creation) was pretty quality and we did really enjoy it.

The flavor I had on the top of my cone was red velvet cake an not only was it a red velvet cake flavored ice cream that was amazing but it had huge chunks of red velvet actual cake in it which is very rare for a red velvet ice cream to have. And then with that I had ""nutter butter"" which was legit nutter butter flavored ice cream (like not vanilla, not even just peanut butter, but fully nutter butter) with HUGE chunks of nutter butter cookies and chunks of peanut butter. And the waffle cone was homemade but like it was legit probably a like super special secret homemade recipe for it cause it tastes soooooooo much better than a normal waffle cone and like had a different texture cause it was like a little thinner and more crispy and tasted closer to a real waffle than normal waffle cones do. My cone was handed to me with a big break in it, but the ice cream was hard enough that it actually didn't melt without my tongue licking it, so the break surprisingly wasn't a problem at all.

Not even close. I don't like when chains try to cut corners and go cheap. They sacrifice quality. Some damn bean counter came up with this.  I will never order this again.  Not worth it. I can do better at home. When I go out for dinner, I want something I can't get at home.

Karim the owner is an excellent chef and host.  The tapas are amazing, I recommend the tagines and the lamb chops.  Also not on the menu but worth asking about is the blue cheese pate, it's incredible.  The entrees are equally delicious;  huge lobsters, seafood wellington, seabass, and ostrich stand out.  To finish get a cheese plate or the chocolate souffle.  If you have not been I would recommend it as your next destination.

We had a reservation and were seated in the upstairs area of the restaurant after we walked in. Our waitress was LOVELY. She walked us through pretty much the whole menu as well as explaining some of the drink options as well. 

I started with a sake that the restaurant had on tap, which was wonderful. my husband tried one of their cocktails and then stuck with his favorite Manhattan after that. 

We started with the okonomiyaki (a Japanese pancake, at Green Pheasant made with ham, bacon, scallops, potatoes, and various traditional okonomi toppings). It was good, but not my favorite thing we ate. Next we tried the shumai (at Green Pheasant, made with lobster and spot prawn - and served with clover ponzu) - these were okay, but definitely my least favorite thing we ordered (they had a slightly strange flavor to me, but that may be because I'm so used to shumai made with shrimp only). 

Next we had the spicy crab noodles (with crab butter, sweet red crab, and tobanjan), which were very good. Lots of crab on the dish, and it was just the right amount of heat! 

But the Ikinari steak was my favorite of the appetizers or entrees we ordered! The steak was American skirt steak with corn and onion and miso brown butter and j sauce, served in a hot hot hot sizzle plate like is traditional at the Japanese steak restaurant chain Ikinari (picture a fajita platter at a Tex Mex restaurant). The steak was great (perfectly cooked); the corn and onions were charred where they had touched the hot sizzle plate; and the miso brown butter was just the right richness for the steak. I'd come back to Green Pheasant just to eat this again. A great dish.

But we didn't stop there. We ordered two of the desserts as well. I ordered the ginger creme brulee which was SENSATIONAL (I might be back at Green Pheasant again soon - I want to sit at the bar, order some sake or shochu, and eat the Ikinari steak and the ginger creme brulee. Quite simply one of the best desserts I've had recently. The ginger flavor was amazing, and the creme brulee was so smooth. I LOVED IT. My husband has about 10x the sweet tooth I do and he ordered the tempura fried slice of chocolate cake. I tried a teeny tiny bite, and it's just WAAAAAAY too rich and sweet for me, but he enjoyed it (definitely for people who love sweet, rich desserts only). 

We had a couple more drinks (including a shochu cocktail that was DELICIOUS). The service was excellent, and the restaurant pretty nice (I do think sitting downstairs is probably nicer, because upstairs is pretty sparse compared to the decor on the main level). We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I think we'll be back.",2019-02-28 20:26:35

The food came out stunningly fast, was fantastic, so much so that my husband went back later in the evening and got another one to go!

I had a pot roast Po-Boy which felt kind of sacrilegious, but was tasty. My husband had a half dozen oysters and their Peacemaker Po-Boy. We each had a cocktail as well. Mine was fine, my husband's first try was pretty awful but our server was quick to replace it with something else. 

The only potential negative, and even this isn't a big deal, is they use hand held devices for ordering and processing payments and the server stood there as we swiped our card and added a tip. Kind of awkward.

My $4 sundae turned out to be the size of my head, for serious. 3 scoops of ice cream on top of a warm brownie with hot fudge, whipped cream, nuts and a cherry. It was so incredibly good. You should share it with someone, since wasting this felt like a crime. It was impossible to finish, though.

Since we had a 5pm reservation we were able to partake in their happy hour specials which included drinks and $5-$7 sushi rolls. It was a great deal considering the quality and ambience. For the sushi we went with the classics spicy tuna, spicy salmon and the salmon avocados. They were able to accommodate for my friend's wheat allergy but giving her gluten free soy sauce. The waiter was very patient and thorough with making sure my friend did not encounter any wheat products. Besides our sushi, my other friend got the chicken dumplings and the avocado ginger salad, which were both excellent. We also happened to come on a particularly beautiful day so the doors were open and they had a photographer take pictures of their new menu items. One of which is this stunning cocktail called 1912 which is inspired by the cherry blossoms in DC. The bartender sprinkled hibiscus dust on top and garnished it with beautiful flowers. It was light and refreshing and not too sweet. It also doesn't hurt that it is a beautiful work of art!

I finally had a chance to pop in and ordered the japchae with anticipation. I think it was just under $9, a bit pricy in my opinion for a vegetarian japchae with a small scoop of rice. It didn't have that much flavor, to be honest.

My significant other got the truffle mac n cheese, which he was all about. I wasn't that into it, but as you can see, I'm kind of a turd.

This quaint and cute, old-fashioned ice cream parlor hails back to the days when quality service mattered.

Service does take a little while, since each drink is made to order-- I guess you could say, ""with love.""  The ice cream is worth the wait, though!

Perhaps Mike knew that I was a tourist, or, perhaps I am just that cute *wink*, because I was served a scoop of Tennessee Fudge so generous that Texas would be jealous!

But, I would get tired, real quick, of people asking me for sample after sample and taking their sweet time to order, even when there is a huge line. So, hindsight is 20/20. 

Anyway, there are a ton of flavors to choose from, which I always appreciate from creameries. Especially ones that hand make their own product. I ended up getting the Tennessee Fudge flavor, as did my counter-part. It seemed to be a vanilla base with copious amounts of fudge folded in. The other flavors were traditional favorites, simple staples, nothing really off the wall. That Tennessee Fudge was delicious, though. I would order the hell out of that again.

All in all, Mike's is good. Not outstanding, not the best I have ever had, not one of the top in the nation, but delicious nontheless. What you'll find here is just a good creamery who makes good homemade ice cream.",2015-10-06 13:30:14

The menu offers several traditional Italian choices and prices are fair; about $20 will get you an entree that includes a salad and side of pasta or vegetables. The dishes were executed fairly well though I have seen better. The veal parmigiano was tasty but perhaps a bit one-note, and the tender meat was not as melt-in-your-mouth as it could've been. The shrimp scampi were all cooked perfectly in a lovely, well-balanced butter sauce. However, the side of pasta was on the salty side. Unfortunately, the tiramisu was the most disappointing part of the meal - not enough rum and too thick a cream took away from the lightness of the dessert.

But, while Ricardo's may lack slightly in their food, it certainly makes up in atmosphere - a solid 5 stars. The tables are spaced out enough to allow privacy and the dining area is relatively small, which creates just the perfect amount of ambient noise. Service was also excellent; our waiter was polite, timely, and welcoming. All of this made for a clean, classy environment (or dare I say...romantic?!).

So even though I may not have been truly excited by the food, I did feel at ease throughout the meal, and sometimes that's exactly what I want when I go out. Dining at a place like Ricardo's just makes you feel good.",2012-03-24 06:49:53

The hostess sat us down and seemingly forgot about us, as a server didn't come around to get our drink orders for another 20 minutes. They weren't even busy. The server was not friendly and wasn't familiar with the drink or food menus, she didn't want to answer questions that my father had about the menu. Our food came out quickly but was not good. In a party of 6, half of us did not get what we ordered, and the food we received was all either way overcooked, or undercooked. My husband felt that his chicken wings tasted off, and has been sick to his stomach for the last two hours. None of us had been here before tonight and it's really unlikely that we'll be back.

There are 2 very distinct reasons on why this place isn't receiving a 4 or 5-star rating. The size of the shop and how sweet the ice cream is. 

This ice cream shop is tiny which is surprising. This shop is right in downtown. Lots of foot traffic. Tourists galore. Luckily on a Friday evening it wasn't too packed when we arrived. We didn't have to wait in line at all. It is Autumn though. On a hot day I can't imagine how packed this place gets. It's almost like they expect you to order your treat and leave. They do have a couple of tables, but it's not an inviting location. In particular... during my visit there was this creepy guy sitting close by that kept staring at me while I ate my cone. Stop it dude! Just stop.

I ended up ordering the Superhero flavor. It's 3 different flavors(red, whitish yellow, and blue). I believe it's cherry, maybe banana/vanilla, and blueberry ice cream. I normally wouldn't order some bizarre flavor like that, but this time it sounded perfect! My ice cream was good, but it was too sweet. I only ordered 1 scoop in a cone. I was so full that I wasn't able to eat the cone. It seems too sweet might be a recurring theme for this ice cream shop. The great thing about this ice cream is that it's extra thick. 

The other oddity is that I was hoping for an ice cream/coffee shop perfect combination store as the name(Mike's Ice Cream & Coffee Bar) suggests. Coffee definitely takes a back seat to the ice cream here. They have plenty of hot coffee drinks, but you know that feeling when you walk into a coffee shop. That yummy mmmhmm feeling with your brain yearning for coffee... you don't get that here. You feel more like a kid in a candy shop but ordering ice cream instead.

Next time I'm in Nashville I'll stop in here to try another flavor. Truth be told... I might be spoiled by local Louisville favorite, Comfy Cow!",2015-10-13 14:25:13

But that's the best thing about Chef Karim, his menu is constantly evolving, getting new items that are as good or better. 

Every year he returns to Morroco to visit, which is great for him and his family. It's also fantastic for us, because he comes back with new ideas, recipes (I think his mom is involved here), and more excitement about cooking. Not everything has made the official menu yet, but if you ask about his specials including the early bird, you will find some new starters, entrees, or just plain twists on old favorites. 

Other changes have happened over the last couple of months. He expanded the size of The Pearl, adding contiguous space from a adjoining store front. This has been well used since its almost always packed especially on the weekends when he tends to have music. The Pearl has also gotten their full liquor license, so your incredible meal can include signature martinis and cocktails in addition to the excellent wine.

Lets start by saying I just love Lafayette Square. I love the atmosphere. We were seated in kind of a corner with a good view of the vacuum and extra chairs but I tried not to pay attention. 

As previous 'yelpers' have mentioned, the service was a little slow but nothing I couldn't handle (see Lewelyn's review). Our drinks were never empty it just took some time for our waiter to take drink orders and food orders etc... but then again I think he was the only waiter on shift tonight. 

From other reviews and the raves about the lasagna, I decided to go with that. It literally was a mound-ful of cheesy goodness (thanks for the good review Emily B.). There was just enough sauce and meat to make it delicious. We also ordered the toasted ravioli. The sauce was amazing. Nice consistency and delicious flavor in the ravioli. The fiance for the seafood cannelloni. He says 'it was awesome'. He said you can def. tell there were good portions of lobster, shrimp, and scallops. It was fried but not over fried to where it has that complete grease flavor. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the sauce was a white wine lemon sauce---perfect for dipping bread. 
The house dressing had the perfect blend of sweetness as well.
The overall decor in the restaurant was lacking a bit but the lighting was still enough to set a romantic mood (when you don't look at the vacuum). There does need to be updated decor and maybe some paint touch ups on the wall. Overall a good experience and very easy on the wallet.

It didn't look like they were bothered at all.

 Then we were accused of turning off tv's and the manager tried to stare us down. I'm sure he got his courage from the policeman who was working the door. Needless to say, we weren't intimidated.

The atmosphere of the place is friendly, almost clubby.  It seemed as though the 'regulars' who were there were all older.  

I had their turkey entree, as did everyone else at the table, and had a salad to start.  Others at the table had butternut squash soup to start and it looked and smelled pretty good.  The salad was unusual; I think it was caesar dressing, but on mixed greens with onions and mushrooms.  It was fine but not amazing.

The turkey dinner was pretty good, but not overly flavorful.  The mashed potatoes and the green beans were both well cooked but bland.  The stuffing was very good, as was the turkey and gravy.  The turkey was a touch dry for me, but with the gravy it was hard to notice.

They had a nice selection of wines, both by the glass and by the bottle.  The service was tremendously attentive and friendly...water glasses constantly refilled, bread basket replenished, etc.

On a cool and rainy winter night it felt kind of drafty and chilly. But we were excited to check out this new place. 
The menu is simple and split up into two sections: cold and hot. Since it was so chilly we only got one thing from the cold menu: the Tsukemono. I think of Tsukemono as pickled vegetables and was expecting such, but instead got a mixed greens salad with some chunks of raw fish in it. The chunks of raw fish were quite good, and though it seemed like scraps from other raw fish plates, we enjoyed it. I love scraps and not wasting!
We then moved onto our hot plates. When we asked our waitress about the order and timing she promised all of our dishes would not arrive at the same time and she was right. They all arrived at the same time except for the one larger dish we had ordered. Eh, a few kinks to a new restaurant.  I understand. 
The dishes:
Dan Dan shishito. I love Dan dan Mian the spicy Sichuan noodle dish and I like shishito peppers so we got this. It was a competition on the plate: the shishito vs the dan dan. There is not room in the bowl for two such strong flavors! Neither won. 
We then got the kinoko: warm mushrooms with finely grated cheese on top. A salty warm cheesy dish which felt good on a drafty evening. A small bowl for $13 or so but who's counting?
The star of the night was the stuffed chicken wings: the tebasaki gyoza. The bone removed from the meaty half of the wing and a shrimp toast mixture stuffed in, it was warm, savory and my favorite. Three wings on a plate if you were wondering how many to order for a table. 
Finally we got the trout: a good idea of a whole trout lightly fried with cold slaw and three little steamed bread pieces to make your own little baozi
of fish and slaw. Fish was a little overdone and slaw was a little mayo-naisey for our taste. I think we would have preferred a sharper crisper more vinegar heavy slaw. 
Overall, I think it has potential, but needs to work on some execution and pricing. I mean $22 for a bowl for potato udon? Oy!",2018-12-01 15:37:04

That's what really makes the place special.  Otherwise, its a decent neighborhood bar - not quite the dive others describe it as, though you'l never mistake it for an elitist establishment.  

The bar is spread between two floors.  Downstairs has a corner bar vibe, upstairs more of a sports bar.  The bar also has a deck upstairs.   Like the other bars in the area, Sharky's opted to put ""good looking girl"" ahead of ""fast and attentive"" in their qualifications for bar tender, though the service isn't bad.  Unlike House of Brews, Taylors, and Geets, the bar tenders are more milfy hot than out of your league tart hot.   Ordinary beer prices are what you would expect for a bar of this kind. The beer specials tend to be on nasty Coors.  They frequently have booze brand reps giving away trinkets.  

 But in the end, its the crowd and the music choice is what makes the place.  Bob and Doug's is ghetto.  Geets is more middle age and kind of lame.  House of brews is older and more stuffy.  Taylors is d-bag central.  But Sharky's is a house full of rocker kids.  Since that's my style (even if I'm a little old for it), that makes Sharky's the place for me.",2014-02-15 01:46:25

Some days the meal is delicious. Some days my entree was somehow never placed with the rest of my table's order. Some days my meal is a disaster. 

As far as chain restaurants go, I'd still pick MG over almost anything else.

Chicken spedini is the entree of choice for me at this cozy, casual, somewhat rustic spot in a cute neighborhood.  I've had it three times and will likely order it again next time.

The price of the entree is fair and includes a side (we always get the pasta) and a crispy salad with a lovely italian dressing.  I've had the marinara and the white sauce---I'd suggest you go marinara.

Besides that....The food was awesome. I love wings, and their wings were top notch. I got my wings breaded like I would at Hooters, and their breading is nice and crisp. Their sauces are good although not as many to choose from as Buffalo Wing Wings. In always better than Wings, Etc. I liked their wings above all wings because of the breading. You can get them without breading too.

They have two beers that are made for them. One they claimed was like a Blue Moon, but Blue Moon is better. The other is a brown ale. Both were good. They advertise 29 degree cold beer. I had to be that temperature, because it was slightly slushy at the top. I would rather the beer just be in the high 30's. No need to have ice in me beer.

They have TVs at all the booths from what I could tell. It was really neat to watch a college football game at my table. The restaurant sound system was turned to play that game over the speaker system. On a side note, not all the tables were turned to the same channel. Not sure if you can get it changed for your table or not. 

The ambiance of the place looks like the inside of a log cabin. It has a Ron Swanson vibe from Parks and Recreation. Long tables have axes dividing them. Some chairs are made of of branches. Tables are made of slabs of wood. The walls are decorated with pin up girl calendars and beer related materials. The ladies looked very pretty in their outfits.

The brass hardware paired with bright teal chairs and elevated ceilings gave an upscale, opulent ambiance that I love and is the perfect setting for a fantastic Friday night meal. We met some friends here for the first time and decided to order a lot of things and share. We ordered cocktails, mine was a lemongrass drink with gin that was delicious and the rest of the table had cold sake. For our cold starter we had the wedges which typically I'm not a big fan of a giant stalk of lettuce as a general rule, but this one was cut up into smaller pieces with a hibachi dressing and crispy onions which were delicious. For the warm courses we ordered two kinds of gyozas, one being the stuffed chicken wings which were unlike anything I've ever had and incredibly interesting. They were warm and flavorful and stuffed with a blend of what I think was shrimp and other seasonings. It's hard to describe, but just get them. We also had the dan dan shishito peppers which I have to order whenever they are on a menu and were very good. I think my favorite dish of the night was the spicy crab noodles. They were good because they were actually spicy for a spice lover, and rich but not too heavy unlike other crab noodles I've had. They were incredible and melted in my mouth. I completely hogged the dish and was not as generous with them as I normally am when ordering shared plates.

The fried oysters we received came with very little sauce and when we bit into it there was a squirt of seawater and kind of fishy taste to it.

The J&J roll was well seasoned and each roll had a good balance of flavors and sauce. However, when you eat the fish laying on top, there was almost no flavor and almost had a hard texture to it. Something one wouldnt expect when eating raw fish.

The omakase came out with 8 pieces instead of 10 pieces as stated previously. The excuse we received was because we got to eat Otoro (fatty tuna). There was also no explanation of each piece nor sauce that we received. The sushi itself was something that you would expect out of a supermarket sushi bar, premade and refrigerated.

Dale Mabry Highway in Carrollwood. You'll find the Roman Forum in the same strip mall as Burger Monger, but these folks are on the far northern end near the bagel shop.

The restaurant is huge inside, and it's clear that they are still developing their ideas as not everything is up and running. You have a big sit-down restaurant, as well as an area carved out to be a cocktail lounge. Additionally there are glass cases which will eventually hold salads, wraps, sandwiches, and hot pizza for carryout orders. Also the restaurant has built drive-through windows on the north side of their building.

Right now the restaurant is open for lunch and dinner, but the owner told me that she has plans to also open for breakfast and include Cuban coffee, Cuban toast, and a variety of breakfast items both for sit-down or carryout.

The menu is a nice mix of small plate flatbreads, finger food appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, pastas, and full dinners. Lots of creative choices on the menu, and a welcome addition to this area of Carrollwood.

On my latest trip I had a cup of their seafood soup which had crabmeat, shrimp, calamari, and cubes of fish mixed with Italian herbs in a light tomato broth. spicy and delicious. I also enjoyed their special of the day which was the sea bass sandwich. The filet of fish was breaded and fried, and then served on an Italian roll with lettuce, tomato and a spicy guacamole sauce. The sandwich was huge, and I took half home to enjoy for dinner.

I'm delighted to support a small, family-owned non-chain restaurant in this area of Carrollwood, and thrilled that these folks are willing to take some chances and offer a nice mix of Italian options.",2013-11-28 04:17:34

Let's be real, it's fundamentally impossible to hate on good ice cream. However, I'll be honest-  I wasn't wow-ed.  Most of the flavors are normal classics, like cookies and cream or cheesecake.

Please. If you are a lost nooby ass tourist like me, who knows nothing about Po Boys or NOLA, do yourself a favor and go to Mahony's.

I made the mistake of showing up hungry and ordering a burger and wings. Both were very mediocre for the price. A friend ordered the grilled cheese, which had some kind of onion relish that she didn't appreciate. The beer list was lacking in IPAs and stouts. A live band was playing Weezer covers, which was kinda cool, except the concrete floors made for awful acoustics and it was genuinely difficult to have a conversation without yelling. All in all, I'm glad we checked it out, but didn't find a lot of reasons to return to Craft Hall.",2019-03-14 16:27:51

They had a good selection of wine. We went with a bottle of Rosé and it didn't disappoint. Also ended up getting an order of fries and the aioli sauce was to die. Service was good as well. Only disappointment was how early their happy hour ends.

They have a variety of flavors, both classics and uniques, and all of them are absolutely delicious. The waffle cones seem to be made fresh most of the time; if you smell waffle cones when you walk in, getting one is a must-do. I like getting Red Velvet Cake (red velvet cake ice cream with chunks of red velvet cake) and Mocha Almond Toffee Chip together, and my girlfriend and I often split the Coffee Fudge and Mint White Chocolate Oreo (basic a mint chip and cookies and cream hybrid). 

My only complaint is the staff. Sometimes they are super super friendly, and others they give you the vibe that they don't want you to be there. There is one staff person in particular who falls into the latter category, but he has been a little better in my most recent trips.

I miss their old location, which had a friendly, brighter vibe to it. They moved from 2nd avenue into Nashville Street Taco's old space, and it still kind of feels like Nashville Street Taco.

To elaborate a bit on what I mean with my introduction, it started when I ordered the pollo caprese. According to the menu, this dish is grilled chicken breast, imported buffalo mozzarella, imported pomodorina, capellini but I've been on carb restricted diet so I opted out the capellini pasta and subbed the sautéed spinach. So what arrived from the kitchen was a grilled, tough and dry chicken breast, uncooked (basically raw) spinach and a few clumps of mozzarella (which had a unusual taste I find hard to describe, but not as it should). There was no imported pomodorina nor did the dish look at all appetizing!

I thought to myself after the runner left it on the table that I would never order this dish again even before I tasted it, so when our server Lura stopped shortly there after to check on the meal she could see immediately that I was not pleased and glanced at my plate and understood why. She politely asked me if she could make the matter right and took my plate back to the kitchen.

She returned a short while later with my dinner and brought the pomodorina which really helped the dish and a complete new order of the spinach (but again - was not really any better than the first version I was served). 

My recommendation is with all the other menu options to choose from at Macaroni Grill, keep clear of this particular dish, but do ask for Lura because she is a delight and really tried her best to make this so-so meal a more pleasurable experience!",2019-11-26 05:18:58

2nd time out here in Reno, extremely hungry, only thing that sounded appetizing at the time was pasta. Contacted my friend who is a local. He recommended Macaroni Grille and a few others but macaroni grille was the closest and said F it. So I made the 5 minute drive from the Peppermill. It was around 9 pm when I arrived. Parking was accessible. Got inside, unfortunately was not greeted promptly. After asking a bartender if it was open sitting or if someone would seat us she helped us right away and sat us. No biggie. Inside was clean. Host sat us down next to the fire place where we would be warm! Very nice. Our waiter, by the name of Robert, introduced himself and instantly offered us a wine. We had the sausage rigatoni and spaghetti with meatballs. I ordered the sausage rigatoni spicy. Robert offered to bring out a few things to spice up our dish- nice touch! While waiting for our food we were brought the free bread with oil. To be honest, wasn't a big fan of the bread but no big deal! We didn't come here for the bread. While waiting for our pasta we had Sauvignon Blanc. As someone who does not drink wine, the Sauvignon black was the niceyest that I've ever had, (again, I don't drink wine). Our pasta arrived and Robert brought us Parmesan cheese and red pepper flake. To wrap it up, Robert was great because of his personal recommendations and his professionalism as a server, he made the experience really great, he's the man.

Now a few days prior I did the delivery route and it was not what my fellow Yelpers been writing about. After tonight I definitely can say I must Retract my last review. 

Everyone deserves a second chance and tonight was that chance. I met one of the owners (Ray) along with an AMAZING STAFF and the genius master creator of their food the Chef. 

For starters, we had the top shelf chips and the Bruddah Rays Ahi Tuna Stack. The chips were yummy but what separated these chips from everyone else was the Balsamic drizzle. I swear if I did not ask the waitress to take the plate away I would've still been indulging my mouth with these chips. Now the Ahi Tuna Stack was a masterpiece of art within itself so dope that you do not want to destroy it. But once you get the courage to do so the taste is an epic experience. The wonton strips along with the ponzu sauce will keep you wanting more.

My children had the kids mac & cheese, kept them happy that we even took home the leftovers. Now my entreé for the evening was the Top shelf Wings. Hands down the best freaking wings I came across since living in Tampa. I thought Union 72 BBQ had good wings. Not no more! 

The thing about being a reviewer is the truthfulness we write on what we ate or tried at an establishment. What made me go and try Top Shelf in person this evening was the fact that the owner reached out to me. This showed me on how much pride they take in the food they prep and deliver to their consumers. Any establishment that wants to show me, a reviewer that I was wrong, is a place that I can respect. 

I left here with a full belly and already planning my next visit along with family and friends. Kudos to Joe and Ray along with the Top Shelf Sports Lounge staff. You won me over with love being put into your dishes.",2018-11-17 02:29:56

This component of the dish wasn't listed on the sign, and it would have been nice for the cashier to mention it since I specifically requested no pork on my burrito.

We ordered fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese spread and they were NOM. The po-boys hit the spot and had a great amount of filling!

It take them a year for this restaurant to be open. When we know about the news for opening this month, we decided to stop by and check. I also invite couple of Yelp friends to join us. 

Judging the price of the menu, it is about 10% more than regular restaurant. However we were no regrets that because the food measured up with the price we paid. It still has some bump to iron out, our waitress is still don't know which beer is happy hours. They offer happy hours item from 4 pm to 7 pm Monday to Friday. The app is 25% off from the pregame section. The draft beer is $2 off. 

We started with Ybor egg roll. It has mojo pork, ham and salami wrap together. Who can resist it. I also get the tuna bowl. It seared blacken Ahi tuna over rice and Asian slaw. It has the honey soy ginger sauce. It was quite good. Lastly we have the Top Shelf wings. This is must have item. It is about $0.20 more than normal outside restaurant wing place. However, it worth the money. This wing is marinated in mojo sauce, then grill over the open flame and top with the house sauce. It was delicious.

-Dominic makes one of the best dirty martinis I have ever had...better than capital grille/delfriscos

First off, the layout is not great -- you can't see most of the play area from the seats and the hidden area is right next to double doors to outside. Also, they just opened and many of the games don't work, are missing their balls, or won't turn on. In addition, the menu is pricy and the drinks and food were underwhelming. For example, we ordered a Bloody Mary, which was $10, and just included Tito's vodka, Bloody Mary mix, and a lemon wedge. It is advertised as coming with Stateside vodka, but whatever.

How could we not have fun, when we had 30 draft beers to choice from and some of the best pizza in the Bi-State area. We were in the bar area which is referred to as Tony's Third Street Cafe. The bar has a more casual and relaxed dining atmosphere and the wait staff makes your experience fun. 

There were three couples and a single in attendance and everyone raved about their food. Alex the single diner, ordered the Cheeseburger pizza and had them hold the mustard.  It was so tasty, it actually tasted like a big meaty burger. I may have to order that one on our next visit to Tony's. I didn't pay close enough attention to what the other couples ordered, but I can tell you what we had; Onion Rings, Large Caesar Salad and Tony's Special Deluxe Pizza. 

The onion rings were big thick slices and evenly breaded. I can see these being a perfect accompaniment to a ""real"" cheeseburger. Our large Caesar was definitely enough for two to share, or it could be a ""meal"" for a person watching the weight. 
I enjoyed the salad, but for my personal taste I like my Caesar dressing to have more of an anchovy bite to it. 

Our pizza was flawless! Tony's offers two types of crust; thin and thick and they should not be confused with the traditional types. Tony's thin crust is more like a flat bread and his thick is the bastard child of traditional and thin crust pizza. What that means is; the crust of the pie part is more like a traditional thin and the edges is like a traditional hand tossed pizza. I wish other pizza parlors offered this type of crust, because it gives you the best of both. 

Another thing that makes Tony's pizza stand out from others, is his sauce. As stated by James M. it has a little ""sweet"" twang to it. When it is combined with all the toppings on my Special Deluxe it made things pop. That sweet sauce covered in meats, onions, green pepper and black olives was a true heavenly delight.  If a picture paints a thousand words, the one I posted of my pizza is worth thousand calories. 

Our server was a blast, she knew it was a holiday celebration (gift exchanging made it obvious) and she made sure we were well taken care of.  I wish Tony's was closer to my home instead of my work so I could become a true regular.",2011-12-25 16:45:32

They do sushi making classes, we definitely have to check it out! We took the train down and walked a few blocks to reach the restaurant. We arrived before our reservation but were seated right away. We had a window view which made it great for people watching, but it definitely would be better in warmer weather because the windows seem like they could turn the restaurant into an open-air concept.
What we ordered: 

Chicken and shrimp dumplings: Long chives, ginger, crispy chicken skin, steamed. Just your average dumpling. Nothing too unique about it, but they were tasty nonetheless.

Wagyu Beef Spring rolls: onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce was a star of this dish.  I could honestly drink it. It went really well with the spring rolls but made the dumplings much better. We honestly wanted to order like 6 more servings of these. SO GOOD.

Eel Avocado Roll A perfect balance of eel to avocado. It had a teriyaki-ish sauce on top.

Spicy Tuna Roll  Just your normal spicy tuna roll, but it's my go-to. I definitely didn't need to eat any more sushi at this point in the meal, but I love trying them wherever I go. 

Dragon Roll: crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with fried eel and avocados. 

Dynamite White Tuna Roll: spicy walu, crunch, and shishitos.

They weren't kidding about the spice of this roll. The spice was at a good level between the spicy sauce and shishitos and the tuna seemed to balance it all out. Would definitely order this again.

 KJ Roll: seared scallops, Kani, cucumber, avocado, and wasabi aioli

Also delicious. Just the right about of heat and had a great amount of seafood in the roll

Rolls that weren't our favorite: 

Broad Street Roll: spicy salmon, avocado, crunch, soy paper, topped with king salmon and spicy salmon. No rice. 

This was the roll that our server recommended. although it was good, it was probably my least favorite roll that we ordered. I'm not sure if I ever had a roll without rice, but it felt like it was missing something texturally. If you like salmon, you should order it, but it was just meh to me.

Overall, we liked the Tuna Bar. The food and service were good, but the atmosphere was a bit loud for our liking. I think I saw that they have happy hour deals, but I know we definitely missed it by going on a Saturday night. I think the prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi joint.

I ordered a Chirashi bowl, and when I asked for wasabi, I was upcharged $5 for wasabi that wasn't even good - the wasabi was tasteless. Consider being upcharged for wasabi with your sushi - that's like getting charged for ketchup with your fries, or getting charged for butter with your toast. Just doesn't make sense. I also had to wait an extra amount of time to get the wasabi and soy sauce. Since I didn't know about this charge while ordering, I passed the $ threshold in my bill where I now have to go submit an expense report. What an annoyance! The rice was on the stiffer side, and the fish was cut into small cubes, which is not ideal. 

The bartender apologized for having to upcharge me, and his kindness made up for it. Otherwise I would've left the restaurant sort of pissed.

Overall though, I appreciated the restaurant's vibe and the staff's courtesy. The cucumber appetizer I had was delicious.",2018-11-29 02:51:19

Walking in, it's not giving off an ice cream vibe. It's a dark space and in the back is where the ice cream and coffee (?) is happening. 

A few years back, I was in a Chicago suburb and I found an ice cream shop that used a local dairy to make their ice cream. I was looking for something similar for Mikes Ice Cream. Their website has an apartment rental?? Ok, so Mike is a little quirky. Does he make good ice cream?

Walking up, I see ""Blackberry Cornbread"". Sold! One scoop cone please.
I grab my ice cream and sit up front. Wow! Mike, you did good. The ice cream is creamy, and the blackberry is dreamy. The corn bread is nice but it didn't allow the ice cream to stay together. A big hunk of ice cream fell (I caught it in my hand) at a piece of corn bread.

Prices were fair. 

I can't wait for my next visit perhaps for date night when I can taste some of those delicious sounding cocktails and dig into some entrees.

Tony Luke's was alright but  I think Wawa was a lot better value for the money.  We don't have Wawa in NY so I really wanted to see if the hoagies were as good as I read about.  This particular Wawa in the UPenn area was pretty nondescript.  Inside it looked like a bigger and better version of 7-11.  

I ended up getting an Italian hero because it seemed pretty basic and a good baseline for the Wawa experience.  I got it with a little bit of oil and vinegar.  It was the 10 inch version and the total came out to $7.01.  I was blown away by the price because I don't think you can find a full Italian hero in NY for less than like $10 minimum.  Of course you can't compare Wawa to a genuine Italian hero but still.  

I took the hoagie to a nearby Panera Bread and ate it there.  The hoagie wasn't the biggest sub ever, but it was decently sized.  I believe they put ham and salami in there along with lettuce, onions, and provolone.  

The experience of eating this thing was pretty interesting.  Because there is nothing really special about the hoagie and it's far from the best sandwich ever.  However, it was just so solid for the price.  There was nothing spectacular about the hoagie, but also nothing glaringly offensive about it either.  All in all, it was a really enjoyable eat.  The bread was fairly chewy.  The cold cuts were pretty tasty.  The provolone went well with the cold cuts.  The hoagie was just so easy to continue biting into.  After I finished it I had a bigass smile on my face.  

I was so happy with my Wawa hoagie that I stopped off at another Wawa on my way home and got a 6 inch Meatball hoagie ($4.89 total).  That was also pretty solid too.  I also got a medium coffee ($1.65) and 2 kit kats for $2.  I'm definitely a huge fan of Wawa now.",2019-12-22 06:02:59

The place was pretty crowded in the bar area, not so much on the table/restaurant side. 
Our Waitress Jess was very nice and helpful. It seems as though many people there knew each other which indicates there is a local element to the place which is fine, they obviously have a base clientele. 
We started with a few appetizers, the cheese steak egg rolls were good however one of them was a little overdone. They had good flavor with a little spicy kick. The other appetizer was a fried seafood sampler with Calamari, Shrimp and Clams Casino. This was very good and cooked to perfection with a nice portion. 
We decided to split a meal since we were pretty full from the appetizers. We went with the Chicken Marsala and again the portion size was generous. The Marsala sauce was tasty as were the green beans and mashed potatoes that came with the dish. No big complaints about the food. 
The noise level in the place is pretty high, probably because the place is wide open. This noise was apparent even when the live musician was playing. There was a DJ that started at 9 and he did a great job of mixing up the music genres. The crowd really picked up around 10 and the age group of the crowd was pretty diverse but leaned toward the 20/30's group. 
Overall this seems like a fun place to hang out or have dinner. The noise level is high so if you're looking for quiet/intimate then this isn't you're place. 
I will add that since it is winter we found the restaurant seating area to be pretty cold. There are 2 exit/entry doors on that side of the building and every time the door opened the cold air rushed in and there was no protection from it. The heat didn't appear to on very high so the cold drafts made it tough. We actually moved tables once to avoid the cold from the door opening. 
Overall the experience was great and we would definitely consider going here again.",2019-12-25 15:03:06

I am a sushi snob having lived in NYC and Singapore for years, and this is the only place I've been to in Philly that remotely compares aside from Morimoto and Tomo. Their tuna is very fresh and high quality, the salmon and yellowtail are always very good and fresh too. They do a spicy tuna roll 'the right way' with little mayo and big pieces of sushi, as opposed to the mushy, orange paste-y consistency of most spicy tuna rolls I've had in Philly. The lobster fried rice is also very good with a fresh flavor but a little light on the lobster. I haven't tried anything else as of yet.

What sets this place apart is their happy hour and daily specials - you can't beat it anywhere in The City! Salmon avocado, spicy salmon, or spicy tuna toll for $5! You can also choose from chicken and shrimp gyozas and a couple other items for $5. Drinks specials are $5 for the cocktail special and about $4 for beer and wine. Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday where you can get tuna tartare for $7, and Wednesday is hand rolls for $5.

The oysters I've gotten there have been high quality and good-tasting. For the squeamish - I've never gotten sick. And on top of that the other dishes have been delightful.

My wife decided to bring me here for Father's Day. It was a good choice, I really enjoyed it. It is been over 10 years since I've been here. Couldn't really remember why we didn't return, 

The service was great, the manager sat us and was very friendly. For Father's Day, it was not that busy. However the server did tell us that it was really busy earlier, before we arrived, and they are shortstaffed. We saw none of this.

What we ordered:

Drinks
Top shelf margarita, on the rocks, no salt.
Peach sangria
Lemonade for kids

Dinner
Father's Day menu
Steak & potatoes, medium rare, 
Garden salad
Shrimp Portofino
Kids meatballs with spaghetti
Kids chicken with broccoli

Dessert
Decadent Chocolate cake

The garden salad is a $2.50 ad on, however if it is unlimited refills. It arrived and was very tasty, made with bib/butter leaf lettuce. It was missing tomatoes. I asked her for another salad as it is unlimited, but I asked her to add tomatoes. She came back and said it was a very busy day and there was no tomatoes. So she took it off the bill. The dinner also came with a small loaf of bread, that was tasty. It was topped with fresh butter and Parmesan. A little on the salty side.

The steak was cooked perfectly. It was also very tender. Probably one of the best steaks I've had in the restaurant the last few years. The potatoes were baby red potatoes, roasted with a Parmesan cheese. It was powdered cheese, kind a like the Parmesan shaker you get a pizza joint. They had a nice caramelization, tender, yet a little crunch. Can't ask for better. The broccoli that came with it, had a nice rich flavor, but was a little too al dente for me. I think that's just a matter of preference though. 

My wife's shrimp was also cooked perfectly, it came with angel hair pasta and mushrooms. The flavor was a little bland. I think it was a garlic butter, but just not enough flavor for me. But she didn't complain lol. She did like the pinenuts in it and the green leaf vegetable in it.

The kids dishes had good flavor. I think the chicken was about 2 ounces, as well as two small meatballs for the kids meals at six dollars. Lots of pasta in it and marinara sauce. I do feel the kids were a little bit short changed. Not very much protein at all, tons of pasta for six dollars. I was able to share my steak with them so they were happy. 

The decadent chocolate cake was perfect. It was included in the Father's Day menu, and very large. We were able to share it and still not finish it.",2019-06-18 00:59:51

Like a lot of places in the Funk Zone, this place is kitschy, filled with hipsters from LA and very expensive.

I have to say right off the bat that the food was good - we defiantly enjoyed it.    The thing is, it was so expensive that I'll never be back.  I love riding in new Mercedes but I would never own one as I simply cant justify the cost when I can have something else for 1/4 the price that is essentially the same and its gets me where im going in similar comfort.

We got the Burrata sandwich which was $15.....um, what?  $15 for bread, cheese, bacon - and it was delicious but $15?  Frankly, I resent the normalizing the $15 sandwich.  $10-$12 is already pushing it for some of our local hero sandwich shops and those are almost certainly good for two meals and I'm 6 foot 3.

We also got soup and a pastry.  Our bill with tip came out to more than $30

We also got there almost exactly when they opened and my wife had to fight to keep our seats as I had to go change our daughter diaper.  People - quite rudely actually - kept trying to physically take our seats as they we not occupied by humans but by our things as we were going to come back.  I get the feeling had we all gone to the bathroom at the same time, our things would have just been tossed onto the floor.

Our waiters name was Alfredo, I believe it was. His demeanor was pretty strange whenever he would come up to the table he would interrupt the conversation, make a strange joke and then before leaving he would take my nieces empty specialty drink glasses and bring refills without asking so throughout the entire meal we assumed that the refills were free. They both ordered the Alfredo with chicken added and I was told they were pretty underwhelmed by the under salted Alfredo and the dry chicken; for $14-17 per plate Its safe to say I expect a proper Alfredo. I ordered their ""signature"" truffle Mac and cheese and I didn't find it to be good at all; too much truffle oil, not enough salt, pepper or cheese.  When i was given the bill i was unpleasantly surprised to see we were charged for SIX specialty kid drinks for each time our waiter so kindly refilled their glasses without asking or informing that refills were full price or else I would have verbally declined. For 1 appetizer, 3 entrees, 6 specialty kid drinks and a water for myself was just under $95 after tax not including a tip....Woulda spent less if we went to Texas Roadhouse and all got 2lb steaks.

The last two times I've been there the waiters have been absolutely terrible. The first guy was on speed or something and made it obvious that he was annoyed when we asked for bread and other simple requests. During this same trip we waited there for over an hour for two simple salads. 

During our next visit, it was clear that the waiter was hung over. In fact I think he may have been still drunk from the night before. He even knocked over a couple of glasses at different tables. He would constantly repeat his introduction even though he had already been by to take our order. Finally after 30 minutes our salads and soup came. The soup was ok, but the salad was old and the croutons were so disgusting that my girl friend spit them out. They were beyond stale. Our eggplant Parmesan took over 1 hour and 45 minutes to make. We literally were getting up to walk out when it arrived. To make matters worse, the red sauce was so cold that parts of it were still frozen. The eggplant was disgusting as well, we needed a steak knife to cut it. Then the manager came by as she could tell we weren't happy. Her attitude from the very beginning was very defensive. We explained our frustration with the salad, wait time, staff, and entree. She immediately tried to justify the wait time by saying eggplant takes at least an hour to cook. She then claimed that the croutons were made about an hour ago - clearly a bunch of BS. She concluded with ""I'm not supposed to tell you this but our eggplant is very earthy"". Whatever that means. I've had eggplant at other fine restaurants and it never takes longer than 30 minutes to cook nor does it take much effort to cut. Bottom line is the manager needs to go and maybe Mac grill can be saved. Otherwise this business will not survive with her at the helm. She simply isn't manager material, has little to no people skills, and really is a disgrace to the reputation of Mac grill.",2013-01-01 23:33:50

BAP is a no frills traditional Korean food establishment that has been doing takeout this pandemic. The menu is just a few items long and largely consists of different types of bibimbap, all under $10. Ordering was really effortless -- I called ahead with my order for a vegetable and chicken bibimbap and it was ready within 15 minutes. Pickup was also easy and done at a window in the front of the store with a really nice elderly man who I assume is one of the owners. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they gave us free coffee packets which I have since used (I love me some Vietnamese iced coffee). 

The food itself was okay. With the price point, the speed of service, and the no frills menu, I assume the bibimbap is meant to compete with other fast food options, and as a result it should be critiqued as such. Within this category of food, BAP provides a light, healthy, and balanced alternative, which I appreciated. However I think the portion size of the vegetable one was a little small and the flavor slightly bland. You'd do better with spending that extra dollar for additional tofu or meat. Overall, though, it was fine for a $9 bibimbap if you're looking for it. If I lived in the area I could see myself going back if I needed a quick healthy meal and wanted to support a small local business.",2020-10-23 16:48:12

The food and service has been exceptional each time. This last visit we enjoyed live Italian style opera singing. It was very unexpected and fun, definitely not something you typically see at a restaurant chain. 

Every time we've come we couldn't leave less than a 20% tip, these waiters and waitresses are not just nice they are truly genuine. They aren't over the top, with a cheesy ""hello and how may I help you's"" only to scurry from the table as quickly as possible. They genuinely smile and make conversation, have impeccable timing and attentiveness even on a busy Friday night, and know how to make recommendations from the menu. Really wish we could note all their names individually to give them props. 

The food is fully flavorful, not just salty. The bread is warm a loaded with rosemary flavor, I always request balsamic with my dipping Olive oil. Each dish has a unique flavor profile not just your typical Italian style chain where the only options are salty cheesy or salty tomato. People have complained about portion size/cost ratio on other reviews but honestly, I have never left here anything less than STUFFED with left overs for lunch the next day. We typically spend $55-$60 on two specialty drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees (my choice usually being a seafood/lobster dish) at dinner, not shabby at all when you consider the customer service, atmosphere, quality, AND quantity at that price. 

If you suffered a bad experience here, I am strongly advising you give it a second/third shot and even mention your last experience to your waiter when you come in, I'm positive a place like this will make it up to you.

One way you can tell that the flavors are artificial - look at the color of the pistachio ice cream. Mike's was a bright green. Real, unadulterated pistachio ice cream is much more of a dull green, almost brown color. I guess I should have just left when I saw that.

Totally understand a kitchens need to change over but perhaps offer the simple granola with yogurt or create a breakfast ""flavored"" baguette to help out the late morning arrivals?? Maybe a fruit and yogurt parfait in the cold case??? Even on weekends if you spent the night out in the funk zone and return the next day in hopes of revitalizing only to be faced with a salad or sandwich at 11:02 am? Honestly it was 11:02. I would have rushed over had I known that s BAKERY would stop serving brekkie at 11:00. Who knew? Well I guess I do now. 
Suggestions to HSB.... help with the transition! I stood at the counter watching what I wanted to order be handed to the person who ordered 3 minutes earlier than me. OUCH! 
Even granola on yogurt would have earned you an extra star from this reviewer. A 3 minute exception to your hard an fast rule would have earned you 2 more stars despite the food only being a 4. Your staff is lovely. They must cringe when the clock strikes 11:00 knowing they can't bend to any pleading a customer might attempt. 
Don't fight the change .... give your customers a little help with the transition and next time we are here perhaps I can give you a star for improvement.

Being not a big ice cream eater decided what the heck let's give it a try as everyone said it was the best in Nashville. 

The line was long and the place was not that big but let me tell you no one cared. The other thing was that the temperature was about 40 degrees and people were still lining up and eating ice cream.

They had a huge selection of home made ice creams and like all other ice cream shops they would let you try if you so please. I tried the vanilla chocolate chip as well as the roasted coconut, let me tell you I am from the Caribbean and coconut ice cream is always popular, I never thought that I would have to go to Nashville to have the best coconut ice cream ever.

I had asked for one scoop because I did not want much, their one scoop is very generous I must say. The prices were not bad as well, for one scoop was about $4.00 or less which was worth it.

It reminds you of  an overpriced hotel that you can feel fancy in while taking a dump. The inside of the place reminds me of an amalgamation of the sets of Cheers, Sex in the City, and some French Noir.

The Food: 

Starter:

Jumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs

So, this is the first of many dishes were the common complaint is the lack of salt in the food. From the egg, filling, and crab itself, everything was void of salt or seasoning except for what was a little paprika. The textures are boring and 1 dimensional. For 8 dollars, you are getting 3 deviled eggs at the lowest effort of innovation and care. It is something with less flavor and passion than the ones you are partaking in during Thanksgiving at your grandmas.

Brussels Sprouts with Garlic Aioli and Grated Parmesan.

The Brussels sprouts are cooked exceptional well, which is rare. This is ruined, by the lack of salt and seasoning again. I assume this is due to the amount of Parmesan shaved on top of the dish. This gives the dish an overwhelming umami flavor, and it forces you to reach for the garlic aioli to counter it. After about 10 bites, you begin to realize how white you are because you are essentially eating cheese and mayo. 


Entrees:

Ratatouille with filet

No salt on the filet on top. No salt in the dish itself. What is on the Filet is a lot of balsamic vinegar, which is overpowering. The tomato paste hasn't been stewed long enough, so the dish is really acidic especially with the amount of balsamic vinegar being used.  

Quail and Boudin

This dish is weird. If you ever had a fever dream and was wondering man I wish I could eat that, this is what it taste like. The portion of boudin and quail you get is actual small for the price. Guess what the quail doesn't have on it? The fry on the quail isn't good and the breading breaks offs. The chicken gumbo taste so strange like they almost put soy sauce in it and also has notes of sour. The boudin is really good and is the oasis in this odd dish. 


Drinks:

1 Bottle of the Smith and Hook. Your standard Cabernet nothing flashy.
 
Service: 

I usually don't critique service. I understand that we all take breaks at work, but man no water refills, the restaurant isn't busy, and people from the pass are having to bring our food. This is happening while you and your bartender friend are talking the entire time. Not a good look hombre.  

Verdict: A Salty No

If you want to have a glass of wine with the girls or boys, while you look out at Poydras St. I guess this is the place for you. In my opinion, there are far better options location and culinary wise for you to go to.",2019-06-25 14:50:06

Drinks are steep. Like $10-15 a drink. But the drinks were strong and super creative. Since I was on a date I didn't take pics, but they were super pretty. We got the lychee (vodka, lychee, lemongrass, and sake) and the winstons heat (gin, wasabi, lemon and cucumber). Both were super refreshing. 

For the appetizers we got the creamy rock shrimp and the brussel sprouts. The shrimp portion was small but these two were probably my favorite of the night. We ended up getting a regular tuna roll along with king salmon, bluefin, and yellowtail sashimi.

I live nearby, so I go in at least weekly and buy loaves of bread, biscuits and pastries. On Mother's Day, I even asked for their special breakfast of a biscuit with berries and cream, which my husband got to go. In fact, the day before this awful customer service experience, I had purchased over $45 in loaves of bread to take home. 

This past weekend was the first time I ever ordered drinks and sat down at a table to eat in. My husband and I took out-of-town friends for a special breakfast and it turned out to be a fiasco. The bakery was not crowded when we arrived on Friday morning. At the counter, the cashier (a 30-something brunette, who seemed to be the manager), was speaking over the customer in front of her, to a woman walking away, ""Would you like to register a complaint with the owner?"" The woman kept walking away and the cashier/manager turned to the customer in front of her and said: ""Nothing like a customer complaint when you're already having a shitty day."" She went on to complain about everything that went wrong with opening the shop that day before she took her order. My guest and I looked at each other and shrugged it off, since I had had so many positive experiences with take-out orders. 

We went outside and got a table and waited for the other two in our party to arrive. Later, the four of us went up to order. One of our party was a little picky - wanting to know what was in the green harissa, and that was met with some aggressive eye-rolling from the young man helping us. Finally, our order was placed. We sat on the patio and discovered there wasn't a pin to hold up the umbrella and it was starting to heat up. I went back up and waited in line to ask for a pin for the umbrella. The young man rolled his eyes again and said he'd look for it. Our iced teas were up on the bakery counter, so I took those and sat back down. I sent my husband up to get his coffee, which wasn't on the counter, and perhaps the pin for the umbrella, if the young man had located it. Ten minutes later my husband came back with his coffee and all our meals, which were wrapped in to go paper. One was a salad, so that was a mess. 

I went up and waited in line again to get plates, silverware and napkins for us all. There appeared to be plates in the self-serve area under the silverware, but went I bent down to get some, I noticed half the plates had bread crumbs and spilled milk on them. Half seemed clean and half seemed dirty, so I waited in line again to ask for plates. This time, the blonde barista waited on me and I asked for plates. She told me to get them in the area under the silverware, and seemed irritated when I told her half the plates there had milk and crumbs in them. She left and came back with 4 saucers. I asked her if there were no clean dinner plates and she rolled her eyes at me and said she'd see. 

Then, I stood there while she made 2 coffee orders, waiting. After she placed those orders on the counter, she looked at me and said, ""Oh yeah, plates."" She then went over to the kitchen area to a stack of plates. She picked up one and then another. She wiped crumbs off the 2nd and 4th plates with her hands and brought me a stack of 4 and aggressively asked, ""Are THESE big enough for you?"" I ignored the crumbs I had seen her brush off and said, ""Perfect. Thanks!"" 

Over the course of breakfast, which everyone thought tasted delicious, my male guest went back inside three different times and fetched iced tea refills for three of us in our party. When we left, we cleaned up after ourselves and put our dirty plates in the tubs provided. I stopped by the barista and asked her for some more iced tea and she sneered at me: ""Sorry. We don't provide free tea refills."" I said to my friend: ""I didn't realize you were paying for all those refills everytime you went back inside and got them. Thank you so much."" My friend said: ""I didn't. They were free."" He nodded to the same blonde female barista who had sneered No Free Refills at me and said: ""She gave them to me free."" 

So, if you are a handsome man, you'll get clean plates and free iced tea refills, but if you're a middle-aged, heavy-set female who drops about $50 a week in the establishment, be prepared to get dirty plates, a big sexist and ageist attitude and treated like shit. I've dropped my last dollar in this establishment and will be taking my business to the excellent D'Angelos Bakery, where their baked goods are cheaper and just as good, their breakfast menu has more than a couple of choices, their parking isn't a battle with day drinkers in the funk zone, and their staff doesn't treat customers with disdain, like weekend tourists they'll never see again.

Went with a friend on a Wednesday evening around 6:30. We were seated by a hostess with a pair of white sunglasses on the top of her head. Not what I expected for a first impression of what I thought was a nicer restaurant.  There were two other parties in the first room where we were seated by the window. Shortly after being seated a girl came by with water and bread. Then a different girl came by to see if we wanted anything to drink besides water. After my friend got his tea and we ordered an appetizer from girl #2, the hostess came by to see if we wanted wine or a drink from the bar. Throughout the whole experience I honestly couldn't tell you who our server was because between the three of them they all brought us food, filled our drinks, checked on us, brought us a dessert menu, brought us the bill, etc.

Now on to the food, which seemed to take longer than it should for a restaurant with three tables. I must say that we got to ""enjoy"" each course before the next one arrived instead of getting less than half way through your salad before your entree arrives.

Ordered the Calamari for an appetizer, the sauce was good but the calamari was way over cooked and were leaning towards the burnt side.

We ordered a large House Salad with chicken & large Pasta Primevera to share. The waitress offered to split the dishes on two desperate plates so we didn't have to do it on our own. Since she was doing that I asked if my friends plate could have the cheese & onions held on both his salad & pasta. She said it wouldn't be a problem.

The salad plates came out after we gnawed through the calamari. They came separate with mine only having the cheese and onions. The salads looked pitiful and both plates were missing croutons (which we couldn't figure out what was missing while we were sitting there). At one point my friend picked up a piece of lettuce and dressing was literally dripping off the piece of lettuce. Needless to say it was way over dressed.

Now on to the pasta, which we also asked for no onions or cheese on one of the dishes. Well the salads were too good to be true, because both of the pasta dishes came out with onions and cheese. My friend didn't want to be a pain so he ate it anyways and I'm sure paid for it later. The pasta had plenty of veggies in it but it was swimming in olive oil instead of being sautéed. Neither of us finished and turned down her offer when the hostess came by to see if we wanted boxes.

Girl #1 (the hostess) came by to see if we needed anything else and then brought us a menu so we could look at dessert. Unfortunately they didn't have Sorbet for my friend so we didn't end up getting any dessert even though I'm sure I could have polished off a plate of tiramisu on my own.

Again I was under impressed and disappointed with my first visit to a neighborhood restaurant. I'll go back and give them another try, but it'll have to be on somebody else's dime.",2013-07-30 04:32:55

They have a really nice selection of oysters, and they're all really delicious. Beyond that though, it's all downhill. The most recent time I went, we sat for twenty minutes before our server remembered we were there. We ordered 24 oysters and calamari since we knew the oysters would take long time to come out. We ended up getting the oysters before the calamari. That's the thing about buck a shuck, expect to wait 20 to 30 for those oysters to come out, especially if you order a bunch all at once like I do.

Calamari was good but there were banana peppers breaded and fried in there with the squid so I kept getting a mouthful of Dear God No.

I haven't ordered food there since I went for ""brunch"" and left so hungry I went next door to eat. I ordered eggs Benedict but got eggs on uncooked English muffins with some ham and so little hollandaise sauce it literally looked like it came out of McDonald's ketchup packet. 

I mean it, one whole muffin didn't have any at All. What kind of eggs Benedict doesn't have any hollandaise sauce?

We hadn't been there in a year and it has definitely gone downhill. Last Sunday I decided to order the dish pictured (the mushroom ravioli) via Doordash. Ordering went fin, but when it arrived, it seemed a little light for a dish that might resemble the dish featured on their menu, especially one costing $21. I opened it up and I saw this monstrosity. Only a few pieces of ravioli, burnt to the point of being inedible with a dash of (also burnt) mushroom gravy. I immediately called up the restaurant and demanded an explanation. I was told that the General Manager cooked this particular dish and that I would be getting a refund in a week. 
Well, it's been a week. I called and was told it might be another couple of weeks before I get my refund because the folks in the corporate office are only occasionally in the main office anymore. I did get an offer for them to remake my order. No thanks. Fool me once . . .

The courtyard is VERY nice now that we're starting to get some cooler days.  The food was also mostly very good.  The deviled eggs appetizer, while good, wasn't really a standout over other deviled eggs I've had at restaurants.  The main dishes, however, were much better.  My salmon dish was pretty good.  The salmon was nicely cooked and seasoned.  The spinach was very well seasoned as well.  In fact, for some it might be TOO well seasoned.  For me it was enjoyable because I like a bit of spice, but you guys may want to mention on the menu that the spinach features a pretty heavy sprinkle of red pepper flake.  In fact, I'd probably refer to it as a ""spicy"" spinach because I could definitely see some people being taken by surprise.  The crabcake dish was also very good.  Crabcake was very heavy in crabmeat and light on filler.  Potatoes were done nicely, and sauces on both dishes were handled just right.  As far as main dishes go, the main negatives were the Dutch Baby being I think a bit underdone and the poached eggs having slightly overdone yolks but slightly underdone whites.  No idea how they pulled that one off...    But the main reason for subtraction of a star is the service.  First off, lil black dude who was the host, seemed to have ZERO care about doing his job.  We walked in to no smile or greeting or anything.  He just looked at us.  Fiancee says Hi table for two please.  He says ""this way"" and unceremoniously brings us to a table right next to the other two parties in the entire place.  So the courtyard has (I counted) 11 tables.  There are 3 parties in total dining at the time.  And he thinks it a good idea to sit us all on top of one another.  That's just a lack of care or common sense or both.  Spread us out a bit!!  He did seem to care GREATLY, however, when an attractive single diner came in.  Even came back to check on her at some point to see that she was ""doing OK"" *eyeroll*.  Our waitress, on the other hand, was very nice, but maybe seemed to not have a great grip on the POS system as literally EVERY DISH was brought to the wrong table.  Not just ours, but everyone else's.  By the time we had all of our food, there were only 4 tables occupied.  How hard can it be?  Also, she completely forgot my second drink.  BUT she caught her mistake and brought it on the house.  So that is a great positive.  She realized she made a mistake and went above and beyond to make it right without me even bringing it up.  But at the end of the day, the food was very good so I'll very probably be back.  Just, in all honesty, replace the host.  I'm never one to try to rid people of their employment, but if he's only going to show hospitality to patrons he thinks he can flirt with, then he is quite simply in the wrong business.  That, and retrain your wait staff on the table numbers.  I think if y'all can do that, combined with the quality product that the kitchen is putting out, y'all will be very successful.",2018-10-29 22:04:47

From the art installments, to the Halloween Parties and Ghost Tours to the building being empty for years.  When I was at the City Market downtown one weekend, I saw that they were restoring the building and it looked like maybe some new tenants.  I hoped that they were businesses and that they were not turning it into condos.

My prayers were answered and Roast Coffeehouse and Mercer Tavern were soon to be opened.

You would think that with my food obsession I would be one of the first people in on opening day...  Due to the busy summer I did not get to visit Roast until almost the end of August.  I had saw a tweet about a Maple Bacon Latte and knew I would have to drop in to see what they were all about.

The Bacon-Maple Latte is a maple flavoured latte. It is garnished with whipped cream and then a couple of pieces of caramelized Bacon.

The Bacon is fantastic! Crispy and gooey at the same time - it stuck to my teeth. Bacon lovers would love this taste experience.

If you want the latte to have any Bacon flavour in it you need to dunk one of your pieces of Bacon into the latte and let it float - that is, if you can resist eating it!

The Baristas at Roast took a while to get the latte out but it looked like they were having problems with one of the spouts on the espresso machine pulling shots. It was worth the wait - the shots were perfect.

The atmosphere and decor in Roast make for a very comfortable experience. The hardwood floors and open beamed ceiling are the originals from the warehouse. It has a rustic feel while the fireplaces give the atmosphere warmth and the stainless steel bar type chairs give it a touch of modern class. There are overstuffed leather chairs by the fireplaces so there are ""homey"" feels to certain areas as well. Sure to please many different types of customer.

If you like to avoid the hustle and bustle that the ""Green Giant"" offers - then you should give Roast a try. I can see myself curling up in front of a fireplace with a good book and a great cup of coffee for an hour or two.

Kudos Roast!",2012-12-17 21:26:56

I walked in around 7:30pm on a Friday to pick up a birthday cake pre-ordered. I was waiting for a friend so I decided to buy an egg tart (somehow they charged me 90c even though the sign CLEARLY said 80c, but I wasn't in the mood to argue over 10c) and use the rest room while I waited. The door to the bathroom was locked and all I got as an explanation was, ""the last person to use it must have locked it behind them. We have no key."" HOW do you not have the key to your own bathroom? I was confused at first and thought it must be a simple misunderstanding but nope, they really just didn't want me to use their restroom. I asked them where they used the restroom if its locked and they just mumbled and didn't answer me (mind you, there was no language barrier--they completely understood me). So I sat down with the egg tart (which honestly wasn't even as good as those at other bakeries) and waited for my friend.

When I checked on the cake, the name was spelled wrong even though we had confirmed the spelling multiple times. So when I asked the woman to change it, she just had the biggest attitude. I could hear both women behind the counter talking about me, I guess they didn't realize that I could understand. Believe me, I am the first to admit if I am in the wrong or if I had any part in bad service received but this is the first time I have genuinely been shocked at how I was treated.

RATING: I mean sorry to rate a Ice Cream place on coffee and hot chocolate but I'm sure the other reviews show how good their ice cream is! For the colder months, get their hot chocolate! So good!

Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich... wonderful combo with arugula.  It came on a tender biscuit... flavors came together very well.   Quiche... big serving and good flavor.

I was served by the husband who was also the cook and the server. When I needed something I would walk over and gaze into the kitchen to get their attention. The shrimp pancake was their special for the day, so I ordered it and it was short of seasoning but a dipping sauce was provided so it made it a little better.

They have a wide range on flavors to choose from (I'd guess maybe 30), and I've liked every one I've tried. They have everything from the neon kids flavors to more refined flavors like balsamic pear. My go to is Nutter Butter - peanut butter ice cream with chunks of cookies. I've also had pistachio and toasted coconut and enjoyed them. 

They definitely give you very generous servings! And as a result I find their prices to be very reasonable - especially for being in the heart of broadway.

Granted, early summer is the best time to enjoy ice cream but is there ever, really, a bad time to eat a sweet treat. Plus, given Mike's location, it's possible that locals may not be giving it its due (thus, making the tourists do all this work). Ignoring Mike's would be a mistake. If you're a fan of ice cream, you need to spend some time Downtown getting a bit fatter. It's worth it.

Despite seeing the lights and neon, I'd motored past Mike's in an effort to avoid all the yee-hawin', boot wearin' folks who plug up lower Broad. One night, however, I'd spent a good time drinking, socializing and picture taking but doing little in the way of eating. Debating the merits of going home and going to bed, going home and making a late dinner or wandering around Downtown in search of food, I chose the latter... and then I chose Mike's. Why eat dinner when you can eat dessert? I've got to make this 'adult' thing work for me one way or another.

So, I stumbled in and was pleased to see I was the only customer on this particular Tuesday evening. Nice. I perused the flavor options and then went to my go-to. It's important to have go-to dishes so as to measure the quality of what you're eating. When it comes to ice cream, my go-to is the sundae. This is also because I'm a fatty. So, I took on the warm brownie sundae and gave it a good what for. Picture it (and prepare for fragment sentences): large bowl. A moist, dense, cake-y brownie, steaming warm. Whipped cream. Nuts. Cherry. FOUR scoops of ice cream including: chocolate overload, pralines & cream (my favorite), nutter butter (a very close second), and maple walnut (I threw you off with that one, didn't I?). I held my sundae as a prize to the world. Even the worker who made it was impressed with herself. I took my bounty to the front window to eat. As I dug in, I noticed people passing by, looking at it... and stopping in. No lie: within 10 minutes of me being in the front window and luxuriating with my ice cream, the shop was packed. Sundaes were the order of the evening. The mood was jovial (one gentleman telling me he stopped in because of what I was eating and rewarded me with a dirty joke), the dining room was loud and everybody was ice cream eating (cue piccolo; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhUkGIsKvn0).

We stopped in for lunch and I got yakisoba; wok fired noodles, pork, vegetables with a sunny egg and my husband ordered a sando set, a la bento box-esque with pork katsu. His meal came with miso soup, side of the day, rice, and pickled veggies. The veggies in my dish were super fresh and bright. The chopped asparagus was a nice touch. To round it out we ordered two house sakes (cold) with our meal for $6 a glass.The food was on point and we were very satisfied. I wasn't too full, it was just the right amount. 

The decor is fantastic and romantic. They used a lot of deep jewel tones in the fabrics. The booths were microfiber in a deep burnt orange color and others were a deep blue. The chairs were a little mod and the bar open. The booths were tucked away where you could get some privacy. The tables evoked more of a traditional dining experience. 

To say I was surprised would be incorrect, this team knows what they are doing and consistently delivers top notch food. Two Ten is one of my favorite restaurants in town! I can't wait to come back to the Green Pheasant and try more of their food. There are at least 10 more items I need to eat. This is a must try downtown.

I keep trying to catch them straight out of the oven, but I think you probably have to ask them for that or something, because the last time I watched them bring out a fresh batch of egg tarts, and ordered it, it was still cold. Definitely still, good, I just want to try them right when they come out of the oven. I wish I knew when they baked those darn egg tarts. I'll have to ask them next time. Anyways, unlike most of the places in Chinatown, they use a flaky crust for their egg tarts. Pair that with the sweet, creamy baked egg custard filling, and it is a match made in heaven haha. Flaky crusts are the way to go for egg tarts. 

Their other buns and savory pastries are standard; taste the same to me anywhere I get them. My sister favors their butter bread though, which is very good, and can act as dinner rolls. The drinks here are ok, nothing special. They serve the standard milk tea, lemon tea, and they also have bubble tea, but I've never gotten that here. They have a few small tables for you to sit on, and a refrigerator with soda and canned/boxed drinks right by the door so you can grab and go(no five finger discount!!! Remember to pay). I've also had the lemon cake before, which wasn't bad, but sometimes I do stray from the cakes, as they don't always look fresh.

I don't think I've ever seen young people working here; it's usually 1 or 2 middle aged ladies behind the counter. They're not mean, but they're not overly friendly either. They just do their job, that's all it is. No extra smiles or small chat. And usually, there will be one or two middle aged/old men sitting toward the back reading the newspaper, making it seem more like the cafes in HK, where old people will hang out in cafes just to drink a cup of tea and pass the hours by. 

All in all, stop by here for an egg tarts, if nothing else. You definitely won't regret it.",2013-06-21 02:53:14

While we were waiting for our drinks, a party of three walked in and seated themselves at a large table behind us. The hostess came over and explained that the table was already reserved and they could be seated inside. One of the men was awful - so condescending and entitled - barking that he knew the manager and to just tell her he'd be sitting down. The poor hostess went to get her manager, Lydia, who came out and greeted the customers warmly. Lydia didn't waste a moment before throwing her hostess under the bus -- she apologized to the rude patrons on her hostess' behalf, and said she had moved around other reservations so they could have the table. Now, a party who had actually made a reservation and requested an outdoor table, would be bumped inside because the manager refused to stand up to this patron -- not a great way to run a business. Now for the food -- Copper Vine has their menu coded with ""gluten free."" Nowhere does it say that the items are only GF when specified or modified -- it just labels them GF. I ordered the pork belly, which purports to just be gluten free, but mentioned that I have celiac, and our waitress responded ""oh, let me actually go ask the kitchen. I don't think the menu key is right."" She went and checked, and much to my shock, was right. At this point, I was rattled and wanted to talk to someone who truly knew what was gluten free. Our waitress sent over the manager, Lydia again, who had literally no information. She started off with ""well I try to eat gluten free too,"" which is never something that someone with celiac wants to hear. I could tell she was making it up as she went, as she couldn't answer any follow up questions. If I'd been with my boyfriend, we would have just left. Since I was in NOLA visiting friends, I stuck it out, opting for a seafood dish that I was confident was naturally GF.

Can I just say that the house style wings was one of the BEST tasting wings I ever had and In my opinion it is the BEST in WESLEY CHAPEL. 

They are grilled not fried so it's not greasy at all. They were marinated overnight so they are very flavorful. Delicious!!! When you can eat the wings without needing any ranch or blue cheese, I call that a WINNER! 

SN: it is more expensive that other wing related restaurants in the area if you compare prices but it's sooooo good!

You have the option of ordering a poboy dressed (with the usual mayo, lettuce, pickles, and lettuce) or undressed -- but honestly, why would you not have it dressed? I love the crisp and crunchiness of the poboys and that they did not skimp out on the shrimp (our sandwiches were overflowing with fried shrimp). The poboys on the menu come with a side of creole slaw, fries, or onion rings -- I opted for the slaw, which was regular cole slaw with a little kick to it. 

I also ordered a side of spiced potato salad, which was also really good! For drinks, I ordered the Hurricane. I was disappointed in the Hurricane from Lafitte's and decided to give it another try at Mahony's and the verdict?

The people that were seated were almost all elderly.  (We learned later that there is a Nursing Home kind of next door/above).  Things started off well, although we were walked through a maze of tables to eventually get to our booth. The first thing I noticed was that the menu was missing about 1/3 of the items that had been on the website. I am a vegetarian and I'd sort of mapped out what I thought I wanted to order. Unfortunately neither of the items I wanted were on the menu any longer, (Summer Tomato & Mozzarella and Pasta Verde).  Nor was the Zucchini Bite starter that everyone had raved about.  We ordered the Lavosh and beer cheese crock.  The cheese was a bit like cheez wiz as one reviewer stated, but it wan't completely horrible. They also brought out rolls which were very good.

I ended up ordering a Wedge Salad without bacon and my Mom ordered the Ceaser.  My salad was decent. My mother didn't remark on it at the time but later in the car she advised that her ceaser was very bland with almost no flavor, she didn't finish it.  There were no vegetarian entreés so I ordered the Wild Mushroom Flat Bread. My mother ordered the Beef Tenderloin Tips.  The flat bread was inedible, room temp, cardboard crust, it had an odd smell and the mushrooms seemed to be dried and not all the way re-hydrated. I ate half of one small section and sent it back. It takes a lot for me to do that, I've been a vegetarian for 20 years and I am adaptable and will eat pretty much anything that doesn't have meat.  

The server checked with the kitchen and they agreed to make me a pasta dish without meat, which was nice but it didn't overcome the quality of the flatbread.  The pasta they brought out was a huge bowl of linguine with the veg of the day (steamed carrots, zucchini, cauliflower) mixed in and a tomato sauce that tasted like canned stewed tomatoes with no seasoning.  After three bites I decided it was something I could take home and add some seasoning to on my own.  The biggest disappointment was probably the Beef Tenderloin Tips which were covered in a thick gravy I could smell from across the table. It smelled like cafeteria gravy you'd find on cheap meat.  According to my mother that's the way it tasted as well, she said it seemed like it was out of a bag.  

In addition to our meals we got an order of sweet potato fries, they were very good. The best part of the meal by far. Sweet, nicely salted, crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. 

We had a gift certificate and were trying to ""use it up"" so we ordered dessert to go. The Créme Brúlee and Chocolate Glazed Napoleon were both good but nothing spectacular.  

If we had actually been paying for the dinner without the certificate I think my mom would have sent back the Beef Tenderloin. 

All of the waitstaff was very nice, friendly, they seemed to be especially kind toward the many elderly people. However, their behavior was not the stuff of fine dining. They yelled across the floor, they took plates from a table and scraped the scraps onto one big plate before carrying it into the kitchen, they used a loud swiffer vacuum under one of the tables right next to us while we were eating.  

We didn't need any additional dessert items but the cookies other reviewers have mentioned were never offered. There were also several periods in which we sat for long periods of time waiting.  By the time we left the empty restaurant was now filled.  

In the car on the way home we discussed the meal and decided the major issue was it didn't live up to the name or the website.  The food wasn't bistro-like.  It was more reminiscent of cafeteria or hospital food. Bland, canned, over sauced, un-inventive.  

We won't be going back.",2012-05-14 08:21:20

Service is top notch.  Our server was willing to give us a complete run-down of the menu, noting all of his favorites and specials along the way.  He also gave us some recommendations on saki to try, since it was my first time ever tasting it.  

The saki was good, but not quite my thing, so I ended up with the 'bad sleep well' as my cocktail of choice for the night.  It was so refreshing and delicious.

As far as food goes, I definitely recommend getting a few small plates and entrees to split amongst the table, so you can get a taste of everything.  There were just two of us, so we started with the shishito peppers and the tebasaki gyoza (which is a really cool play on chicken wings and gyozas).  Those gyozas were definitely our favorite!  For our main course we split a pork belly ramen special that was delicious!

We split a bottle of Malbec wine (750ML, $36) and 3 appetizers: black truffle fries ($9), brussels sprouts ($8) and the bianca flatbread with added charcuterie on top ($14). We were a bit worried the portions would be too small to share but it filled us up perfectly! Everything was tasty. The parmesan aioli that came with the fries was particularly good, and I actually preferred it over the aioli that came with the brussels sprouts. We added charcuterie to our bianca flatbread for an extra $3 and while the amount of meat was on the measly side, it was very tasty and paired well with the three cheese flatbread -- in layman's terms, it tasted like mildly sweet little cubes of ham LOL. The water also tasted like it's cucumber-infused. 

In light of the new COVID mask guidelines, some staff members were and some were not masked. Service was extremely attentive. We were asked a few times how everything was and were also offered a dessert menu towards the end of our meal. They were able to split our bill between two different cards. We stayed a while (probably longer than welcome) to just chat and finish our wine, and I didn't feel too pressured by staff to hurry up and pay and leave. As for the ambience, while definitely nice, people eating there ranged from couples dressed up for date night to just casual groups of friends i.e. dress up if you want to but also don't feel pressured to! 

I've been told from friends who have gone to Copper Vine prior that there used to be a popcorn dispenser free to customers, so not too sure what's up with that anymore. Overall, seems like a popular spot for a fancier night out! Would love to visit and check out their happy hour.",2021-06-07 23:46:04

The Good:
The space is lovely. It has great ambience and is roomy and stylish with plenty of comfortable seating. It's always cozy and warm, unlike many other cafes. There are nice little touches around, such as a self-serve dispenser with lemon water. This place doubles as a wine bar in the evenings and there's a  decent selection of wine and beer. The baked goods are also quite good. 

The Bad:
The service here is hit or miss. On some days, I have been greeted by a friendly face and on other days, I have had to deal with an unhelpful and lackadaisical hipster, whose description of the maple bacon latte was simply that it is ""sweet"". 

While they do have a small food menu, I have not had the chance to try anything as the one time I wanted to order something, I was informed that they were sold out of everything. This was at 4.p.m., which is the advertised time that they start serving food. 

The coffee here is ok. While they do have a selection of interesting and creative drinks (Maple Bacon latte, salted caramel latte etc.), the actual quality and taste of the espresso is on par with, or marginally above,  most chain coffee shops. For the prices listed, you would expect better quality. This is not to say that the drinks are bad -- only that they could, and should, be better. 


I will continue going to Roast, mainly for the ambience. While it does have some flaws, it is, overall, a nice spot.",2013-02-20 22:43:41

The cauliflower was highly recommended and we all decided it was the least impressive of the evening. The ikineri steak was amazing - large portion and quite tender.

I ordered Filet MR and my BF ordered Sea Bass.  My Steak was COLD on the inside, the cauliflower was cold, the potato a gratin was mushy and there was no seasoning on anything. While my BF ate, I sat waiting for my steak to be cooked.  By the time he was done, I got my meal.  Steak was done a bit more, but no salt/pepper any seasoning.  Vegi's and potato very bland - did not eat. BF's sea bass was pretty good, but everything else on the plate was tasteless.  Even the salad's were wilty.  
When we asked if we could speak to the chef, he couldn't break away and sent some lady over to hear our concerns.  She said she'd tell the chef.  When the check came there was no concessions for our terrible experience.  Not even an offer for a complementary dessert.  
This restaurant was not worth the money, my daughter is a new chef and even she knows how to cook a steak the way it's ordered.

The owners of the truck were really polite so it helped. 

When I got back to my car to eat it, I was thoroughly impressed. I love myself a meatball sandwich but this was above average in my book.

David and I were here for his cousin's birthday celebration and we were seated upstairs. We didn't have a full dinner, but we did have some really good fries and we had a few cocktails. First, since it's a wine bar, I started with a really good malbec that was reasonably priced. I like that they give you the option of a half pour or whole pour, I guess in case you want to just do some tastings. Even though they mainly specialize in wine, they do have a full bar and a pretty decent beer selection. I had the Holy Roller IPA which was a fairly priced $7, especially considering the atmosphere of the place. 

We hung out at a while and they didn't rush us at all as we basically just sipped drinks and enjoyed conversation.

This may be a bold statement, but Tuna Bar is the best sushi I've ever had (and I've tried a LOT of sushi). 

Even the atmosphere is so interesting. The lights and decor are clean and aesthetically pleasing. The hostess seated us immediately at our reservation time and handed us menus, as well as a drink menu. 

To start, we ordered Sapporo beers, a Geisha (green tea, soju, sparkling white wine, green tea flakes), and a See You Later cocktail (which had rose petals on top). I had the Geisha, and it was a great pairing with the sushi- very light but flavorful. 

For our appetizers, we split a tuna curdo (my favorite dish), tuna tartare, edamame, and a seared tuna salad. Everything was amazing and flavorful. The tuna was the best fish I've ever tasted. 

The owner of the restaurant brought us complimentary shishito peppers, as well. They're simple but delicious! I'm actually craving them now. 

For the rolls and sashimi, we ordered a variety- old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna roll, maguro sashimi, and a peanut avocado roll. I attached pictures of the menu that explains what's inside each. 

The maguro sashimi was my favorite. It's just a piece of fish, but it was so tender and flavorful. Even the wasabi that I put on the fish was unique! Much different than the generic, gooey wasabi from every other sushi restaurant I've tried.

Worst of all, the play area (basically the whole point of coming, for us) was poorly thought out. It's a big wooden structure that you can't see many parts of from where you're sitting and eating. So it's not like you can sit and relax while eating and drinking and still keeping an eye on your kids. You have to keep getting up and looking for them.

Who is very knowledgeable about her selection and it's not small by any means, the Japanese whisky list is also very impressive I got to try a few whisky's I haven't tried yet.

We started with a few cold items the wedges which were awesome very light crisp and full of flavor, first off everything is full of flavor.

I just meant it's a strain of chicken that's DNA has never been tampered with by humans and is raised in completely open pens not the kind PETA shows in those tapes and fed an organic Vegan diet. On to the beef I'm dying a happy death at this point... the first two to show up was the mishima ranch American wagyu and the A5 miyazaki prefecture wagyu both very tender and cooked to perfection the American wagyu has more bite to it but the A5 is like seared foie gras melt in your mouth yummy goodness. Last but not least the American skirt steak showed up ... truly a sizzling flavor bomb the corn the onions the miso butter and the j sauce make sure to get everything in one bite for the perfect bite.

I have been going to Tony's since I was a baby, literally. This used to be the nicest restaurant in Alton, IL, but that is not the case anymore.

I have had two awful experiences there within the last few months, and I don't see how I can support this establishment anymore. The first bad experience was a mess from the beginning and ended with me waiting over 30 minutes to get my bill because ""the computer was down."" To compensate me for my $40 bill the manager sent me a $10 gift card (thanks you cheap skate), which I gave to my parents because I was so disgusted by the service that I had no desire to go back.

Just a couple days ago my best friend was begging me to go out to eat with her and I agreed, and she chose Tony's. Great. I started off by ordering a Mojito, which is considered one of the most popular cocktails in America. According to this website it's #1...

http://www.themost10.com/10-most-popular-cocktail-drinks/

Anyways I digress. They couldn't make me a mojito for some reason so I ordered a Moscow Mule.  The waiter first asks me what is in a Moscow Mule (ginger beer + Vodka). So I made sure they had a ginger beer and explained how easy it was to make. Apparently the Moscow Mule is too difficult for the precious bartender to make. Although they had ginger beer and they clearly have vodka they refused to make me one stating that ""they didn't know how to ring it in.""

Anyways that's the most pathetic excuse for customer service I've ever had. I will be taking my business to Gentelin's, Moonlight and the amazing Bluff City Grill.",2014-09-29 19:00:47

Most of these bad reviews revolve around poor service, and I was feeling exceptionally patient yesterday so my husband and I gave it a go. 
When we arrived (Wednesday night 8:45 p.m.) it was very slow, I counted two other tables inside the restaurant when we entered but several people dining at the bar area. 
The guy who sat us (Zack) was also our server, so we were able to order drinks right away. This place makes a fantastic Shirley temple. I'm normally not a soda drinker and I finished my glass. 
Zach was courteous and competent. He brought us bread and even came back by with balsamic vinegar per our request. We ordered the mac and cheese bites appetizer with truffle sauce. So delicious (you can't go wrong with fried macaroni and cheese!) We also ordered mushroom ravioli. This has always been my favorite dish from Romanos, and it did not disappoint. In fact my husband mentioned he thought they added more mushrooms than usual and we love mushrooms. 
Our entrees came with Caesar salad. This is new or newer, in the past you always had to add a salad if you wanted salad with your entree. We were surprised when it came to the table since we had not ordered them, but Zack let us know they come with our entree. I'm not a huge fan of Caesar dressing but this salad was so delicious, the lettuce was crisp and cold, the dressing was creamy and it had the perfect amount of Parmesan cheese on top. We really enjoyed our meal here. Zack came by to check on us, offereing us dessert before bringing the check. We were so full after the bread, appetizer, salad and entree we had to decline on the dessert but based on how wonderful the rest of the meal was, next time I will save room! 

Don't let the bad reviews keep you from eating here! It is a chain restaurant but if you've eaten at Romanos before you know what to expect and they definitely meet the expectations at this location.

It is quiet and dimly lit, perfect for a romantic night out but for us old married folk?, we prefer the ""bar"" side.  There are plenty of high and low top tables to sit at as well as the bar and in the warmer months, even a nice little patio to sit out on.  The bartenders and wait staff on the bar side are much more laid back then the restaurant side.  Tony's is a great place for food but also drink as well as they have dozens of beers on tap....better than most micro breweries.  In short, the food is great, you have a choice in ambience, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Oh and for the review that said they are dirty?  It is one of the cleanest restaurants around.  You must have had dirt on your glasses.",2011-12-23 18:24:12

We picked up some breakfast snacks from Helena Ave. Bakery to bring back to our hotel and were so pleasantly surprised by the amazing food quality, freshness and creativity.

Don't sleep on the Elvis-style banana bread with peppered bacon and peanut butter.  There's enough for left-overs later in the day.

The salmon bagel with pickled onions, fresh dill and cream cheese is perfectly toasted, presented and packed with flavor.

We also loved the green eggs and ham sandwich.  Sky-high fluffy eggs with shaved ham, cheese and green harissa for a spicy/tangy kick.

The coffee was very flavorful as well.

We ordered three things off the menu to share:

Mac and Cheese with Chorizo: It was ok at best and it did not look at all appealing. 

Chicken Wings:  They were small and really had no flavor ( we ordered them hot) there are way too many places to go to have good wings (Keystone Sports Review or Fat Dan's) to think about coming here again for wings

Potato Skins:  These were good, but really, how hard is it to cut up a baked potato, put some cheese and crumbled bacon on top and stick it under the broiler a second to melt the cheese.

I was really excited about this place after I read the IBJ article but nothing that was in that article was real life when we went.

The space is beautiful; walking distance to the dome jf you want to go before the game or easily accessible to an after work happy hour for people who work downtown. 

The menu is creative but maybe a little too ambitious and the kitchen seems to be a little sloppy. The best appetizer I've had is the lump crab deviled eggs which are served as 3 halves. Three. Not 4, not 2. This makes splitting awkward and every time I go I chuckle about not getting the remaining half. I've had the ratatouille which is hearty but despite all the different ingredients tastes like it's just oregano. This dish also led to unfortunate digestive issues later. The second time I visited it was for brunch and my crab cake Benedict, along with another persons dish, arrived with hard boiled eggs which were supposed to be poached. I stuck my fork in the egg expecting the yolk to come dripping out but instead the ball just rolled elsewhere on the plate. I felt bad, but I had to ask for another egg. Even though we were one of maybe 4 parties in the entire restaurant, by the time I got our servers attention the crab cakes were cold. The egg they brought me later was undercooked enough that I questioned if it would make me sick (the white still has clear parts in it) so I opted not to eat it.

We decided to order the pretzel and asked if they were large or small (they sell them in 1 or 2 pretzel options).  She said they weren't large so we ordered two.  When they arrived we were surprised at how large they were.  She offered to change it to one pretzel, but it wasn't a big deal so we kept them both.

We both ordered a variation of the philly chese steak sandwich.  I guess I shouldn't have expected much, but the steak was heavily seasoned with pepper and not the most tender meat I've ever had.

First off, it's all metered parking or pay for the covered garage next door. So lunch with a friend ended up costing $8 to park. The space is large and open, filled with light and multiple places to sit.  There are three stations to order food along with to-go items and a small market area. We arrived before 11:30am so the first station was serving breakfast along with coffee & teas. I assume it would have a lunch menu after 11:30 but didn't check before I left. The other two stations make salads or sandwiches. There's the option to order from the menu or make your own, pretty standard choices and most things on the menu contain meat so not a lot of choice for vegetarians.  I decided to go with the ricotta toast.  To me the bread is the foundation when ordering toast and it can make or break the meal. This toast was two standard slices of bread from a grocery store loaf, so nothing special at all. Topped with ricotta cheese, pistachios and honey, it was filling but that's about all I can say. My lunch companion was equally as unimpressed with her egg sandwich. I ordered a hot tea, which was the standard tea bag in a paper cup of hot water. I assume the attraction here is the location, making it a place for surrounding business people to walk to for a quick meal. Definitely no reason to drive out of your way for a cafeteria style meal.

Plenty of indoor and outdoor shady seating and decent WiFi make this a good place to work. Nice music playing, from Beach House to Grizzly Bear. Great coffee - no pour-overs, but their drip coffee tasted fresh. It's from the Dart Coffee Co. (new to me) - lightly roasted Peruvian beans. Decent value too - I had a coffee, bagel with cream cheese and tomato, and muffin for about $9. Coffee refills are free, so I had a blueberry scone ($4) to go with the second cup ;) I have mixed feelings about their pastries. They all look good, and while the bagel tasted good, the muffin and scone were bland and both were a touch overdone. The muffin was listed as grapefruit poppy seed, and while the texture was good, there was no grapefruit flavor that I could detect. It was a Monday - perhaps an off-day?  Would recommend it for the coffee and ambiance, and I think the bakery side has potential - their baguette sandwiches look great.

I'm also giving Helena Avenue Bakery 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* Their coffee, from Dart, is certified fair trade and organic. 
* They use organic flour for baking, sourced from Central Milling
* They have ceramic cups and plates and metal utensils for eating in-house.
* Items like sandwiches have just a simple paper wrap.
* Even items that come in packaging (like house-made pickles) they have made fairly sustainable choices (cardboard and PET). 
* Cold drinks cups are compostable, although hot cups and lids are not. 
* Water is available in little glass jars.

Honestly, it reminded me of Dave & Andy's back home in Pittsburgh with the light and crispy waffle cones and extremely rich ice cream.  We all enjoyed our chosen flavor and there were many to pick from. The servers were uber friendly and although there was a line, it moved along quickly. 

We were lucky enough to get a table by the window which was perfect to people watch inside and outside onto the strip which is very lively. 

The fact that this reminded me of home in Nashville was a win for me. I can't wait to come back to visit. Best believe I'll be stopping here again!",2015-06-03 03:38:21

The room has a great flow to it and the art on the walls compliments the place well.  The beer list was better than average and the menu was interesting.

Unfortunately there were some things that we really didn't like: the beer list has no prices nor does it specify what is on tap and what isn't. This made the final bill shocking as I didn't expect a PBC bottle to cost $8.99+. The tap list was illegible from the tables and the waiter suggested I go look at it to see what was on it. My flatbread came out over cooked and cold. Our waiter, while he tried and was nice, wasn't very knowledgeable about the food or beer.

You enter the restaurant through the courtyard, which is a decent size for the CBD. The existence of a courtyard is especially noteworthy in pandemic times - some people want to avoid dining indoors - and the fact that it's shaded is major bonus points.

I placed my to-go order with the host and then sat in a corner to wait. There was a table with wipes and sanitizer by the door, and all the employees seemed to be properly wearing masks. There wasn't anyone dining in, but I got there right as they opened, so it was still early.

I was brought my drink immediately, per my request, though they also offered water while I waited. My food was ready about 15 minutes later. I got the Pick 2 combo of crawfish grilled cheese and sunflower arugula salad, and along with the standard utensils and napkins, they included 2 packets of alcohol wipes.

The crawfish grilled cheese was great: thick, gooey, and packed with flavor. I'm not normally a salad fan, but the arugula salad was pretty good too, and I'm glad I got it to balance out the richness of the sandwich.",2020-08-04 22:23:19

Not only is it in Downtown Santa Barbara, but it is located in the trendy FUNK ZONE close to the wharf. Really, you could start your day here and walk to a whole lot of points of interest from here.

The egg, ham and cheese in a biscuit breakfast sandwich is so hearty and filling that you could split it into two, if you like light breakfasts, and be good to walk around for several hours after.

The biscuit is so buttery and flaky. The pesto sauce was so good. The cheddar was sharp.

The heirloom tomato galette, though not as heavy in the tummy is still large and filling.

They also serve very good espresso coffees and teas.

Outdoor dining was available - when it was allowed. Masks are required.

Street parking is plentiful in the morning, not so much in the afternoon.

Helena Avenue Bakery shares their space with a wine tasting shop. So the space is a bakery in the morning and a wine tasting shop at night. Great concept!

Also, there is a doggie bowl of water provided for your four-legged friends/kids.

The buffalo oysters were way too salty, soggy, and breaded (I couldn't even tell I was eating oysters). I rarely ever feel AVERSE towards a food, but this dish I actually couldn't continue eating. The jambalaya and gumbo were both also too salty, which kind of disappointed me since I know these dishes are NOLA's classics as well. 

Since this place is known for PoBoys though, we decided to order three: the chicken liver, alligator, and shrimp. The shrimp poboy definitely lived up to its name (and is the reason why I'm not giving this a 2-star rating)! The alligator poboy was also pretty decent. The chicken liver poboy was a little overwhelming (tasted overly oily/buttery, but I guess that's the nature of chicken liver itself anyway).

We had a really good time, the food was tasty and the staff was professional.  I have read the other reviews and have to wonder if they went to a different restaurant.  Maybe there have been some changes made, I am not sure.

I had the grouper special, it was really good and came with a topping of steamed spinach.  The Greek salad was fresh and well dressed.  We also had the saganaki appetizer, it was nice and large and tasty.  The pita was hot and crispy.  My mom ordered the greek sampler appetizer and it was really good.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, even my picky toddler.  She had chicken fingers and they were not greasy or over breaded.

We did not experience any of the staff drama discussed in earlier posts, nor did we find the place full of hoosiers.  Then again, maybe I am a hoosier in denial.... lol.  It had a good mix of older patrons and a few young couples.  The bar is separated by a wall, and there were some groups in there having drinks.  Overall, a  pretty normal crowd for a Monday.  It is not an upscale restaurant, nor do they pretend to be upscale.  It is a comfortable neighborhood eatery.  They are putting in a patio area that looks like it will be nice once it warms up again.

We will definitely be back.  Our food was hot, tasty and prompt.  Our drinks were refilled often and when we asked for more pita, it came out fast and hot.  Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I have only been there the one time, so it is hard to claim perfection.",2012-10-30 14:43:23

The food was absolutely marvelous and subtly balanced Southern and Japanese influence. We had the mushroom dish, the walu, the spicy crab noodles, and the whole trout. 

The mushrooms were divine. The walu was so delicate with just a little spice. The spicy crab noodles had the best slightly chewy texture, the crab itself was a very fine texture and flavored the noodles, and it had just the right amount of heat in the back of your throat. The trout was amazing because of the salted crust, the meat just fell off the bones. We made little buns with their upscale cole slaw and it was jaw dropping.

So, it was just the two of us but we were not asked to be seated at any of the two bars and instead taken to the low tables at the right wing of the restaurant where I could tell families were placed.

I'm not a restaurant manager and I know organization is a big part of this but if you're a customer and waitresses are wandering around and you can't find yours if you ask the first you see for hot sauce or the check the least you expect is being told that she is not taking care of that table and wait.

My family and I went last night in an effort to celebrate being together for Christmas.  There were 8 of us,  all adults. 

We arrived and were seated at 6 pm.  Our drink order was taken.  Six waters were brought for the eight of us.  Our ordered drinks arrived after 6:30.  Three of eight drinks were wrong.  It took another 15 minutes to get this corrected and the two additional waters.  

We finished our drinks.  No additional orders were taken until our food arrived at 720, 80 minutes after we ordered.  

A second drink order was taken then. We all ordered the same thing to make it easier on the waiter.   These arrived some time later.  

The food was not good.  ""The New Edition"" was flavorless.  The pepperloin kababs were soaked in butter and nearly inedible.  

What was particularly galling about the experience was the service.  Our waiter was nice but incompetent.  The head waiter walked by our table multiple times,  could clearly see our empty glasses,  and never approached us.  The owner did as well.

Our party of 8 had come together because of a death in our family and were were treated horribly.

We came in the door and asked for a table.  She proceeded make us wait an inordinate amount of time while she stared at her iPad as if trying to find us a table in an establishment with only 4 occupied tables.

We were taken to our table which was a picnic bench style and outside.   There were 6 in our party and we were expecting 2 more.  When we got to our outside table, we took 2 chairs from a nearby empty table in order to accommodate our party.  Our server told us that the rude, power hungry manager said we can't use those chairs because the table was reserved.  There was no reserved sign on the table and the entire time we were there, not only was no one ever seated at that table, no one was even seated nearby.  Our remaining 2 party members arrived and were told not only could they not enter the establishment but they could not sit with us because the rules prevent more than 6 people at an inside table.

I should have heeded the other poor Yelp reviews that I had read & selected a different restaurant.  If you are contemplating going to this restaurant with children; please note this review as a cautionary tale.

Reservation was at 2pm & we were seated promptly & the table selection was perfect as we were placed in our own little section away from the rest of the crowd (this was a nice touch).  Everything went down hill from here.  We put in the kids orders (2 macaroni & cheeses, 1 crabby patty & 1 chicken tenders) within 10 minutes of sitting down.  An hour later, after 3 prompting conversations with our nice enough waiter; the kids' orders finally came out.  This was a consistent theme throughout the experience; nothing came to our table without continued prompting & near begging.  Our 2 appetizers came out 1.5 hours after sitting down.  Finally, our 3 entrees came out; nearly 2 hours after sitting down.  Again, nothing came to our table until I requested/complained/implored the waiter to please bring something to the table.  

The food varied; most of the plates were pretty good, grilled salmon, crab cake sandwich, lobster blt tacos, & calimari; however; the east steamer pot; both the crab & mussels must have been sitting & over-steaming; just as we did the same....the crab & mussels were completely overdone & was a similar experience to chewing on your tongue.

There was nothing noted, offered, or provided by anyone at the establishment; except a brief apology to the tune of; ""sorry for the wait"" from the waiter.",2015-05-11 17:58:24

A tiny little poorly appointed dining area, and tons of case line, with pre-prepared foods, deli type foods and baked goods. A big counter for sandwich/sub making... and while there, that's all I saw them sell, I think maybe their main attraction is fresh baked breads for the their subs. 

Several of us ate their Lasagna (with meat sauce... seriously, just meat over top?!?)... not that flavorful or good.  Also an alfredo sauced cheese tortellini with chicken... had a strange spice and was watery... not good. Salad ""dressing"" was the best item we had.

We ordered a bottle of wine and a number of dishes to share. Everyone raves about the spicy crab noodles and for good reason. Ours could have been a touch hotter in my opinion but once I had that first butter savory umami bite I couldn't part with it. I would come back here often just for this dish alone. We also fell in love with the Tebasaki gyoza. At first when they brought it to our table we were confused as we expected some traditional dumplings, but when our waiter explained how the dumpling filling is stuffed into the chicken wing we raised our eyebrows a bit, took a bite and were astounded at the taste and experience of such an innovative concept. It's hard to surprise me with food and yet this did. My wife still talks about this dish and for good reason. Mindblowingly amazing! We had the broccolini and shrimp dish as well which was fantastic, but compared to the other dishes we ordered, was not in the same stratosphere. Great but not innovative or life-changing. We had the cheapest steak on their menu, which in hindsight I wish I would have insisted on the wagyu or something, but my wife devoured the american steak and claimed it as her favorite steak for some time (I assume that excludes my weekly sous vide offerings).

Manager needs to go she can't manage and has a very bad attitude. People behind us were complaining because of slow service etc.

We paid our bill including dessert for 6 of the people, when the manager asked how everything was we explained what happened her response was well you have already paid so I can't refund anything now, but I can give you dessert.

The churro donut, pesto asparagus salad, chocolate zucchini bread, peanut brittle cookie, chocolate chunk cookie, espresso, and so on. My all time favorite is probably the chocolate zucchini bread as it is so dense and flavorful while also tasting fresh and light on the digestive tract. The chocolate chunk cookie is a close second.

I haven't had many savory options here as they are pretty darn pricey for the portion size, however the couple I have had have been mighty tasty, fresh, and packed with the perfect combo of flavors. So in a sense, yes it's expensive but you are really getting what you pay for. They have many breakfast options that are served until 11 am then the lunch baguettes and side salads take over. 

Personally, I'd recommend this spot if you are looking for an artisanal breakfast with craft coffee and quality foods and/or sweets. It's also a nice spot for those wine tasting in the funk zone and want a little snack-a-roo between tasting rooms without walking too far and/or eating too much. 

Food is tasty, staff are kind, and the environment is adorable - The only downside to this spot for me is the prices. It would be a full 5 stars in my opinion if things were just a little more affordable. I'd also enjoy if they had a little more lunch options that didn't include so much bread in them or paying $10 for a few bites of delicious greens instead. Wraps would be awesome! Overall though, tourists especially, definitely check out this bakery at least once and try a quality baked good!",2017-08-11 18:21:21

I was at this Subway at 6:17pm tonight. The air outside was chilly but nothing compared to the wrath of M. The woman in front me had 2 small kids with her who were running around the restaurant as chillens do. She had some coupons and the order was complicated because her kids are picky eaters (weird right). Just bread with no filling then ham, bacon and pepperoni slices on the side - okay so it wasn't complicated. Apparently the shift lead who we can refer to as ""M"" just wasn't having it. She was training a guy named Tyler as it was his first day. Some of the highlight reel is as follows:

""The ham is right here. They just call it Black Forest ham to make it seem fancy or something. It's just ham.""

""I can't toast half your sandwich and not toast the other half. You're just trying to be cheap with your coupons."" 

""Well we're a franchise so if I make this sandwich the way you want me to, my boss will end up chewing me out when they're looking at the inventory.""

""I don't care go ahead and get me fired.""

M's bad attitude ended up making a child cry and the woman in front of me who kept giving her multiple (too many) chances to just make the sandwich she ordered, ended up walking out of the restaurant sans sandwich with her kids.

During this whole exchange, Tyler and I looked on uncomfortably. While M was off terrorizing this family over some meat slices, I coached him through my meatball marinara. He did a truly stellar job - maybe make him shift lead as his customer service skills were fine.

Brentwood I expect better from you. Looking at other Yelp reviews I sense a theme of an employee with a bad attitude. I have no interest in bringing business to owners who choose to look the other way with this beyond poor display of customer service. Needless to say I won't be coming back to this location. I only like drama when it's being shown on a rerun episode of Vampire Diaries.

The whole ordeal still has me gaping like Patrick Star. Tonight Tyler not only learned how to make a meatball marinara. He was also taught how not to treat a customer.",2019-01-18 01:38:51

I decided on their onion rings (more like straws) and a Coke to complete the meal. Mahoney's does a light, crisp batter on their plentiful portion of shrimp. Gorgeous tomatoes and fresh lettuce were an excellent addition to the sandwich. I love pickles on my Po-boys as they bring a terrific crunch and acidity. The local bread was crunchy perfection but cut a bit oversized. If they created a trough in the bread, it would have made life a tad easier keeping the fillings inside.

I was very happy with my po-boy, but the onion straws (rings) were on greasy side and arrived at the table tepid. I was too hungry to deal with sending them back, but only ate a quarter of them.

I'll admit to being a creature of habit, so no one that knows me would be surprised that tonight, absent the prodding of my wife or friends, I ordered items that I had before.  

I started with Grandmom's Wonton Soup because I needed something soothing.  I believe I tasted a very slight hint of vinegar in the broth.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but whatever it is, it provides a modern flare to the broth, to go along with the delicate and very tasty deconstructed wontons.  The dough used for the wontons is extremely light, and the sausage is more significant with great flavor.  My second course, the Wok Kampachi Ceviche, was not only as delicious as before, but this time the kampachi was a more generous serving than my earlier experience.  

Rather than a number of smaller dishes, tonight for my third course, I decided to order a larger entree.  The Salmon Shokiyaki proved to be just the right choice.  I like my cooked salmon to have a warm pink center, yet a slight crispness on the outside.  This dish was perfectly done with a warm pink center, slightly crisp, along with a glaze on it that I think may have been miso based.  I'm not sure about the glaze, but it doesn't matter because I'd order it again anyway.  

Between the food and a sampling of a few sake's, it was a great way to spend my free time.  At this restaurant, the only other thing I really wished they served might be an assortment of robatayaki.  Are you listening Ken?",2018-02-20 22:26:12

Friends and I met up here to take advantage of their attractive Monday specials[1]: their ""Buck-a-Shuck"" special meant raw oysters were a mere $1. We indulged in half-off appetizers, $4 classic mojitos - surprisingly good, with a kick - and $1 PBRs.

At the bar, bartender Mario[2] paid a lot of attention to us. Shared a huge, awesometastic assortment of thirty (30) oysters, trying about EIGHT different varieties, freshly shucked in front of us, and were some of the best I've had in recent memory. While sklorking them down, we watched the Olympics on flat screen TVs, then washed everything down with a few oyster shooters full of vodka. Mmmm.

Doc Magrogan's has lots of seating, and outdoor tables too. As more folks showed up, we were corralled into a side dining room. Meghan, our brave, sole server, somehow managed to serve the twenty of us.

I'll be back to Doc Magrogan's for their oyster specials, just not to sit at a table - at least, not with such a gargantuan party. Check them out, and tell them Dave sent you[3].

The bar area was pretty quiet until about 20 min before the Eagles game.  It became packed with folks ready to celebrate the eagles!  The tv monitors were strategically placed in perfect location and the game was on full audio blast.  So if you're into watching the football game at a bar this is the place.

This place serves brunch so we all had the opportunity to order brunch at the bar as well.  For a large party it's perfect because you don't have to split a bill.  You order at the bar get a number and sit anywhere, they will bring the food to you.  Well, that's great but the food wasn't the best.  Not horrible but nothing to write home about.

It took them a significantly (20 mins) longer time to bring out my friends food and she ordered the same thing. Then when it was brought out, wrong might I add, he had an attitude about it and did not offer another option or apologize about the issue.

What I found was that this place was a nice little mom and pop joint where there was a sense of simple foods but in a contemporary area.
I've had my fare share of korean food while in philly, Los Angeles, New York and houston.
Honestly speaking. . . It is a standard price for korean food. A little higher than other joints. In all I spent over 15 dollars for a bowl of beef bibimpop and veggie pancake.
First the pancake. I didn't like that it was very eggy compared to all that I have tried. It lacked crispness and it lacked. . . Flavor. It was as if it was reheated, although I'm not sure. It wasn't hot and it wasn't crunchy and it wasn't tasty.
As for my bibimpop I wasn't impressed. It was very standard for 11 bucks. The veggies were assorted and it tastes exactly what it looks like, if you want the crispy bowl it jacks up to 12 bucks. I've been to many joints and I would say this caters to the not so asian crowd.",2018-08-09 02:31:15

My part visited during lunch and there must not have been more 10 people attending during our time. Ironically the salad was the best part of the meal. The ginger dressing was delish but maybe a bit over dressed. I found the rolls to be entirely too fishy and not too flavorful. Also call me skeptic, but I don't like the boxes that the sushi is served in. The little wooden rates and obviously hard to clear because we could see debris under our rolls.

Anyways, the menu items were expectantly  priced for the type of venue Green Pheasant was. I don't think anything was below $10 and one of their entrees was around $25 per ounce (minimum of 4 ounces per order) for examples. Even though the price can be a bit steep, the food was well worth it and tasted delicious.

So loaded up the family in the minivan and made the pilgrimage to the city and met up with two other of my girlfriends' families. This large industrial building is spacious and has a convenient location in Delaware Avenue and had lots of free parking around.  Outside they had some outdoor seating and a chicken coop, rabbit hutch and a little garden area with tables. 

Inside was ginormous and there were many large tables for big groups available to choose from.  We easily found a table for 8 kids and 6 adults.  The lower level had a play area for the kids and another bar.  There was a play structure to climb on, basketball game, tetherball, some video games (Mario, Kirby, etc), mini skew ball, a telephone booth, picture booth and a broken pinball and  broken shuffleboard table.  The kids area was definitely fun but if you look closely it didn't seem very safe or thought out.  Like the basketball game near the slide opening.  My daughter got nailed in the head.  The metal tether ball on a stage surrounded by concrete seemed a bit sketch.  I was a little anxious letting my kids play there.  

I did not have any beer on this visit but the group's consensus was that the beer was just OK.  We did order fries, pretzel with pimento cheese, the mussels, some pizzas and some collard greens.

I planned a surprise birthday dinner for my best friend here, and everything from the moment I called to inquire about availability was flawless and above average customer service.  Karah, the manager I spoke with, worked closely with me to make sure all details were handled, down to prepping the hostesses not to mention a party when I arrived with the birthday girl.  Karah not only helped me the day I called (a week or so before the party), but reached out the day of to go over final details.  She was enthusiastic and thorough.  In fact, she even came by to wish the birthday girl a happy birthday and stopped back a few times to ask if everything was going well. 

Our server, Duane was flawless!  He gave us an enthusiastic overview of the restaurant, it's food and suggestions.  He explained everything extremely well and made our experience personal and exceptional.  He always had a smile on his face and gave wonderful suggestions, i.e. the onset egg on the wagyu steak!  

The FOOD!  THE FOOD THE FOOD!  We spent roughly $1200 for a group of 13 and there wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates!  People made NOISE while eating.  The food is so well prepared, came out in waves (never allowing anything to get cold, it came out immediately when ready), very well presented and perfect for a large group to share.  The cocktails were delicious as well.

Overall, the wait staff, the managers and every single thing about our experience was top notch and well worth every penny.  I highly recommend The Green Pheasant!  Thank you so very much for making a special occasion even more special and completely positive.  Cheers!",2019-01-14 01:15:26

After trying nearly all of the bakeries around Chinatown, this is probably my favorite.  First of all, the staff is very nice and helpful.  I wish I knew their names because I'd like to give proper credit to the staff, but the lady who speaks English without an accent is so friendly.  Every time I stop in she'll say hi and ask how I'm doing with a big smile.  I really feel like I'm a regular at this point.  I once came with my mom and now she's always asking how my mom is and when's the next time she'll be back.  

On to the buns.  I've tried most of the items available at the bakery.  There's a wide assortment of sweet and savory buns, desserts, and prepackaged steamed buns ready to go.  I'm really obsessed with Chinese style dried shredded pork, so I always have to get either the 'pork over bun' or the rolled up bun with green onion and dried pork any time I walk by.  To someone without much Chinese bakery experience this may sound weird but you have to give it a try, such a great balance of sweet, salty, savory, decadence.  Everything else for sale is also top notch.  I was lucky enough once to grab some egg tarts that were literally straight from the oven and I have to say at that point they were the best I've ever had in my life.  

They also have an assortment of hot and cold drinks available, but I don't have much experience with those.  All in all this is a must-go if you are wandering around Chinatown.  Stop in for a bun or a dessert.  It's a great treat, from an exceptional staff, and it definitely won't break the bank.",2016-03-01 15:27:01

After reviewing the wine menu we decided to go with a bottle of Italian red. 

For an appetizer we ordered the pheasant dumplings. These things were AMAZING. Tangy and not to filling, we absolutely destroyed them instantly.

For the entree we decided to go with the Japanese wagyu with a side of roasted cauliflower. I highly recommend these delicious cuts of beef if you decide to come here. It arrived on a slate platter with 4 optional topics. We sprinkled the salt and pepper over the top and began to enjoy. The wagyu was everything I hoped and dreamed for it to be.

Menu: short, curated categories of small plates, sashimi/sushi by the piece, and rolls 

Tasting notes:
-Wok kampachi ceviche: fish was thinly sliced, lightly seared on one side, a means for picking up the strongly ginger, salty sauce; this was very much of a light but absolutely lovely appetizer
-Lobster fried rice: tender pea shoot leaves among extremely umami shiitake mushroom slices and bite-sized chunks of sweet lobster; rice was not too oily and on the chewier side; a very shareable dish
-Mai fried rice: small pieces of sweet, meaty sausage contrast with the refreshingly crisp chopped snap peas and surprisingly large, full shrimp; mixing in the runny fried egg added a subtle creaminess; cilantro is the garnish, an fyi for people who might be like me and not love the flavor
-Yellowtail house roll: kept simple with yellowtail and avocado with a little bit of garnish, very clean-tasting
-Fishtown roll: basically a rainbow roll with crunchy, sweet, firm shrimp tempura wrapped inside with a mayo sauce; the size of each piece and the ratio of fish on top to the rest of the bite (rice, shrimp) was perfect for me

Noteworthy:
-Server was very attentive and friendly and great at explaining the night's specials, down to where the seafood was sourced

 For lunch, I started with the "" Jumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs"". They seem to have a strong mustard and pepper taste. I also ordered the ""filet mignon brochette"" which was cooked very nicely and accompanied with wild mushrooms. The sweet pepper whipped garlic forest glaze was the perfect pair.

 For my main course, I ordered the Wagyu burger with Brussels sprouts! Listen the burger was extremely juicy, with the perfect choice of gruyere cheese and served on a soft burger bun. I was so happy ! The brussels sprouts were cooked great and the garlic aïoli was awesome. I even put a little on my bun!

It was as hot as the first crawfish boil and the cement was sizzling, we did have reservations but it took the server, or hostess,  some time to configure where we were sitting. But always, mask up. 

This is def a ""let's catch a drink while we're downtown"" or pregame here! Or def, drink before football game kinda vibes. There's no parking, so off street it is! M there is a paid parking lot in the back if you choose to park. 

They handed us our handy dandy QR code so we can scan them into our phones and view the menu that way. Very nifty with what society is coming up with during Covid times.

ffy6ZSlcMu8bkKtHEqUqKw,67YrvmdkWqC0arqgt0obJQ,MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA,4.0,5,2,3,"Hip, mid-century modern decorated sushi spot with some hits and some misses but overall a good time. 

Came with a party of 7 to celebrate my mom and aunt's birthday. We opted not to bring a cake because they have a $45 cake fee. 

The drinks here were strong and I quite enjoyed them. I tried the Winston's heat, which was very much cucumber-y and refreshing, the NORI-Grets, which basically tasted like a margarita, and the Yuzu sour, which was a bit too sour for me. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes for the table, which came to around $400 with tip and tax. 

Things I'd recommend:
1. UNI: the uni here was surprisingly fresh (compared to a lot of their other fish). While MP was $12 a piece, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Not sure if the UNI is always this fresh, but we definitely came on a good day. 

2. Vegetable fried rice: I'm sure all the fried rices here are good (they have 3 different choices in total, a sausage one, a crab wasabi one, and a veggie one): We opted for the veggie rice and it was delicious - Super simple, but full of flavor. A bit greasy, but definitely a delicious and straightforward dish. 

3. Grandma's Wonton soup: I didn't try this, but this was a dish ordered for my grandmother (we thought a grandma soup would be good for a grandma lol). She really enjoyed this! These are Fuzhou style wontons so they're super small, but she ate this entire dish and that doesn't happen often - so they must've been authentic and delicious! 

Things I thought that were just OKAY: 
1. The rolls: We ordered the eel avocado, California, avocado, and peanut avocado roll (lots of avocado lol). While they were pretty solid (was personally not a big fan of the peanut avocado roll), I'd say it really wasn't anything special. I guess they presented it in an aesthetic way, but definitely not any better than the regular $5 lunch special rolls at a random sushi joint. If you're a fan of sushi rolls, their rolls are definitely a safe option to order but again, they won't wow you. 

2. Oysters: My mom actually really enjoyed the oysters, so this might be a preference thing. They weren't bad by any means but I definitely didn't like that the oysters were pre-seasoned and flavored. Whenever places do that it naturally makes me question the oyster freshness. We ordered 12 oysters in total, 6 East coast and 6 west coast. The oysters were around $3, which I thought was pretty pricey - especially because dollar oysters are pretty easy to find. I pay for $3 in NYC when I've missed happy hour and am REALLLLLLLY craving oysters, otherwise I can't really justify the price - especially in Philadelphia and for the size/taste of these oysters. Again, not bad but not worth it in my book. 

3. Seaweed salad: We ordered this for my grandmother who's pretty picky with what she eats. It tasted like standard seaweed salad. Not really sure what else to say about this one. 

Things I'd skip: 
1. Tuna tartare: My cousin mentioned this was a dish that was pretty popular here so we decided to try it. Tuna didn't taste very fresh. 

2. Big tuna sashimi: Tuna, again, didn't taste fresh. I'm confused why this place is called tuna bar when their tuna doesn't seem...great. Our waiter described this as an ""omakase"" but we chose to order and share with the table. The best part of this plate was the tuna rolls. The sashimi slices were fishy and honestly the color of the fatty tuna made me feel, for lack of better words, A BIT FISHY, about this place. 

OVERALL, this place is a fun time and has a great atmosphere. Their fish and tuna truly is...whatever, but I'd still recommend this spot for a nice date or hangout with friends / family.",2021-09-12 13:29:58

The waitresses are very nice, and the food comes out very quickly.  Yesterday when I went I noticed alot of families are there to eat. There are a ton of TV's with different sporting games being played. If you order an appetizer wait a minute to order your meal because the food comes out that fast.  I like to take my time eating my appetizer.  
The food so yesterday I got the loaded potato soup and it was so, so good. I asked for green onions on the side to add to my soup.  That soup was so good not salty at all.  It had fresh bacon, potatoes and cheese.  
We also order fried pickles which was enough pickles to feed 4 people.  It comes with ranch,  and they were not greasy at all.  They were a mild flavor pickle so not tart.  I had the cheeseburger and added bacon for .99 cents.  The bacon is a nice thick cut of bacon.  The burger comes with lettuce,  tomato,  grilled onions, and mustard. The bun did break apart on the bottom for some reason. The patty is a thick piece of meat and it was very good.  
I will definitely go back I would like to try their Cuban sandwich.  I was going to get it but she said it's on a hoagie bun.  I would like to see if they can do that sandwich on their Texas toast they serve with the soup.  
Lastly,  I would like to see this restaurant have the tables/ bar top table more spread.  It's like part of the restaurant is social distancing and part of it is not. They are located in Marion County so the capacity should be less according to the Governor rules.  The restaurant both times has been packed with every table filled.

We missed happy hour, which was totally fine. Now for the review, their rose sangria was literally rose poured into a glass and a fresh strawberry & a basil leaf were thrown in -- not exactly sangria folks. Then I ordered Mayor Roffignac, which is supposed to be a Maylie's signature drink -- allegedly cognac, raspberry shrub, simple syrup, & sparkling wine -- it was godawful and tasted like cough syrup. Food-wise, we ordered duck fat fries & they were great (that's what got them at least a single star) and the large cheese board. The server came out, unceremoniously dropped the board down and spun on her heels without a word of explanation of what was on it, and we looked down and there was literally a total of an ounce of three tiny slivers of cheese sitting there.  That's it!  The bill for five cocktails, fries, & cheese board was $100 including the tip.

In a town of fabulous craft cocktails everywhere you go & restaurants opening & closing on a weekly basis, their game is lame and duck fat fries can't be the only thing carrying you. Needless to say, we won't be back. Next!",2019-01-29 23:38:18

Today we took my mom there as per her request (Other fine restaurants were considered/suggested) but Mom having fond memories of Tony's fare insisted on Tony's Alton
 (Most know not related to STLs Tony's)
Early reservations made again as per request as she lives 73miles from Tony's and prefers to arrive home before it gets too dark re her poor eyesight.
3pm reservation made: At no time did reservation staff mention any issues r/t reservation time. (As we would have gladly made it for 4pm if needed)
We arrive, staff at hostess stand obviously not familiar with ""hosting"" and frantically searching for reservation book.
We are seated: Soon we discover that No Baked potato (Dad's favorite) would be available as they had none prepared... Ok he chose a different side. Of note when asking about alt sides waitress not only wasn't sure but obviously not happy we were asking about alternate sides! 
Food arrives: Dad and I 12oz Pepper Loin filets Tony's is known for. Historically this is a very tender,flavorful meat with cracked pepper and butter.... today?  Flavorless, Tough, and not at all the same. The ladies had Chicken breasts which I learn later were undercooked with very bland rice dish! We were all very disappointed as we have historically loved Tony's food but they have definitely ""fell off"" our favorites list....as we all 4 agreed an Alternate restaurant will be in order in the future!

I ordered a little strawberry custard pastry and took a chance on their tea-making skills. My husband opted for a drip coffee.

It's a really lovely setting, and you can see into the kitchen inside. Friendly service. Most everything you need (water, stir sticks, sugars, etc) are all accessible and they give you a number to take to your table.

We sat outside with our pastries and my tea came out within a few minutes. It's a loose leaf blend. As far as I could tell it was good quality tea... but they served a miniscule amount in a huge bowl of a cup. Like, less than a teaspoon full. So even after leaving it to infuse for a long time there was barely any color or flavor to it. I couldn't be bothered to chase it up so I just drank it. The rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per cup, plus one for the pot. Obviously this wasn't in a pot but a heaping teaspoon is still required for a regular cup, so a big mug like this could use 2.

The pastry was heavier than it looked, more like a cinnamon roll with custard and strawberry than a butter pastry. It was nice, a good size, fresh fruit, not too sweet. 

Really lovely setting and overall a decent experience, but it did fall below my expectations a little bit. I know tea is tricky but if you're making the effort to serve a nice loose leaf, it's worth serving it correctly.",2019-11-26 17:59:23

Its not a big place, so get ready to get cozy with your fellow ice cream lovers. The Building is deep and long, not wide, so when you walk in you have to walk to the back of the building to get to the ice cream line. On my visit, the line was out of the door, which apparently seems to be the usual with this place, so be prepared for a wait. However, the wait was not terrible and the line moved really quick. I will say it took us about 15 minutes to get from the sidewalk to the register. 

Ill be completely honest here...I walked into Mike's with every intention of getting a cup of ice cream, two scoops actually, but ended up walking out with a cookies and cream handmade milkshake. Do I regret my choice? Absolutely not! Did I still end up sampling an ice cream before making my choice, yup! So, technically I can speak to multiple products that Mike's has to offer!

In addition to their homemade local ice cream, Mike's also offers a variety of coffee drinks, assorted danishes, milk shakes, brownies, old fashioned sodas and frozen drinks such as lemonade. As mentioned above, I ended up with a cookies and cream milkshake and it was delish! They offer the basics of milkshake flavors from vanilla, chocolate, etc...or you can choose any flavor ice cream they serve to have a shake made out of. Speaking of their ice cream, they have a plethora of flavors for you to choose from, upwards of 20-25 when the case is fully stocked! Of course they have the staples such as chocolate chip cookie dough, mint chocolate chip, vanilla and chocolate; but additionally, they have some really creative and tasty flavors such as blueberry cornbread, chocolate banana pudding, superhero and many more! I ended up sampling the blueberry cornbread, because you don't see that flavor listed and at least sample it! I enjoyed it, but my heart had already fell for a milkshake. 

In addition to the treats themselves, everyone that worked there was genuinely nice, patient and helpful in all interactions I was involved in and that I witnessed. Overall, I can tell why this place is jam packed at all times! It is certainly on my recommendation list and ""return to"" list for my next trip to Nashville!",2019-03-30 23:20:31

My expectations were set on a 4 star and better rating meal delivered. For the reviews on here were great from my fellow Yelpers. Unfortunately, you can't believe all that you read. Will say in their defense that they do not have control of the Uber drivers. For this, our food was warm and not hot enough. 

Our meals of choice for this evening were for the Mrs. I ordered her the blackened shrimp lettuce wrap. She loved it and my wife is very hard to please so kudos to the chef at the Top Shelf Sports Lounge. For my boys simple and a basic rice and beans. Nothing fancy about it they were okay with it but not the best rice and beans they had. Lastly, for myself, I ordered the Thunder chop chop bowl which I wanted to love. But due to a sufficient amount of burnt rice in the dish, they fell short of receiving my love. 

Definitely willing to try them again this time in-house. So until I make it over there this rating will stand. Everyone deserves a second chance to prove themselves. Till we meet again Top Shelf Sports Lounge.",2018-11-15 01:07:46

The waiter was great. 

The food was very bland, very boring. We both ordered pasta dishes.

Why bother going out for that? My dish was much the same - not bad exactly, but certainly not good. This is not a place we would go back to.",2012-08-10 16:04:34

I only went two times before this last time and I had all mixed feelings about it. My first time was amazing. My second time was not so great but I did get a cute birthday pic in the bathroom.

Anyways, I met up with a friend from out of town at this place and was super excited. Of course, I looked up the menu that morning and decided what I would get. You also have to decide what you and that person can share too (foodie tip: if the person you go to lunch with doesn't mind splitting things, then do it!) Get separate plates and go ahead and cut things down the middle. Usually their sandwiches already come cut!

We got the lump crab deviled eggs, LA crawfish grilled cheese, the goat cheese and fig flatbread, and the soup of the day. It was alot of food but so good. HIGHLY recommend the LA crawfish grilled cheese. It comes with fries that are just too good to pass up. Also, ask to sit on the patio.

It's a beautiful restaurant, the food and service was great and their specials were amazing. The ambience is perfect for a date night. We ordered the brussel sprouts which were nicely charred and doused in sweet and salty sauce, and the tuna tartare which isn't a super unique dish but it was done very well and it came with rice crackers to serve as a vehicle for the tuna. We also went with some happy hour rolls of spicy tuna, salmon avocado which were $5 each then a peanut avocado roll as well for $6. The peanut avocado roll is so simple and so good. I actually ordered a second one I liked it so much. I've had spicy tuna at more places than you can count, and this is exactly what you want when ordering spicy tuna. You can tell a restaurant knows what it's doing by the rice. Tuna bar knows what it's doing. Again, these aren't super original, but just done very well and a bit more refined than your typical fusion restaurant. We finished the meal with some Mochi for dessert that had 3 flavors and they were all delicious.

Since there's a lack of happy hour info on Yelp, here's the down low on their happy hour. This could be the best happy hour deal in the whole city. It's Mon-Fri from 4:30-7. Drink options are: one sake (mine was only $4 and poured traditionally overflowing into a masu box), one house red and one house white wine for $7. We went with the white and it was pretty good. You have the options of 3 beers, Kirin, Kirin Lite, and Orion for $5, $4, $4 respectively. Then there's one rotating house cocktail for $7. The night we went, it was a gin martini made with craft vermouth which is a ridiculous deal for just $7. Judging the way they handled the sake alone I'm sure their bar program is excellent. I will return to confirm this.

Happy hour food: 3 rolls for $5 each, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and Salmon Avocado. There's also chicken and shrimp dumplings for $7, edamame for $4 and shrimp and oysters for $2 a piece. 

Bonus tip: (as far as I know) every Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday. Spicy tuna rolls are $6 all day and tuna tartare is $7. Every Thursday is Toro Thursday. Negitoro rolls are $7 all day.

Last night I decided to try a new UberEats offering, Copper Vine. The menu via UberEats is pared down from what I see on their main website. Not sure if that's an app limitation, or just an inventory issue when I placed the order. In any case, what was offered seemed very appealing to me and my family. We ordered two of their take on the Impossible Burger, their Waygu Beef Burger, their Copper Vine Cuban sandwich, and the Baby Herbs Salad. After placing the order, my wife and I went back to the distraction of streaming TV. After probably 20 minutes or so, I got an alert from my UberEats driver that there was an issue and he would be delayed. I called the restaurant and was told that the chef wasn't happy with the presentation of one of my entrees and was remaking it. I thought to myself, ""Wow, perfection during a pandemic. That's a good sign."" ... and I have to say I was more than happy with the food. When it did arrive a short while later, my family was more than happy with the quality and presentation of the food. Everything was top notch and delicious.

Currently, this is the only beer garden in the city that has a dog park so we were really excited to see what it has to offer.

There were other patrons dining outside with their dogs and it was a nice environment except for the occasional loud motorcycles on Columbus Blvd.

My husband placed our drink orders and a dog biscuit through contactless ordering. Our order arrived not long after. The drinks were all right. The dog biscuit was huge, which was great, but it was so hard to break into pieces and chew that we decided against giving it to our pup.

We also noticed many small shards of broken glasses on the ground in the outdoor dining area. A dog could easily have stepped on it and gotten hurt. My husband and the family from a neighboring table picked up the pieces of glass and removed them from the area but I'm very upset about this.

Mike's was the only place to come up on Yelp for having virgin lemonades but the second I got there and saw all the amazing ice cream orders I immediately changed my order to a root beer float. 

Turns out it was National Root Beer Float day anyways so #Winning on my part. They make the soda there in shop with syrups, I believe, and their ice cream is locally made. I got the Caramel Cone in my float and man was it perfect. It was a very generous scoop with such thick consistency that even the carbonation couldn't puncture. I would 100% order again. Next time around I'll try an orange soda with orange sherbert as someone in front of me ordered that and it sounded/looked absolutely fantastic. 

Mike's is nationally famous for their ice creams being featured in People magazine and on Rachel Ray. They are known for their legendary blackberry cornbread and having the widest variety of coffee and espresso drinks in downtown Nashville. They also do brownie sundaes, milkshakes, coffee shakes, banana splits, and sorbets. The staff are super cool and the line moves fast.

We made reservations and arrived a little early, but normally I do not think reservations would be necessary. It is a quaint place tucked into a strip mall on the south side of 107th Ave as you arrive onto Treasure Island. The inside is more spacious that you would think from the outside. The service was a little slow, but the whole meal only took about an hour an a half. 

First, the Pearl has SUPER AMAZING Lobster Bisque. It has plenty of big chunks of lobster and great overall flavor and texture to the bisque. My wife can be pretty picky when it comes to Lobster Bisque, and ever she agreed this is one of the best places for Lobster Bisque in the area.

The Escargot was a little too salty and they could cut back on the garlic a tad. It was still good, but man did that garlic taste linger into the evening. The Mediterranean Flatbread was fantastic. A good amount of cheese and just a perfect blend of ingredients including artichokes and olives and balsamic. My wife and I shared the above and each got our own bowl of Lobster Bisque and we were perfectly full. 

My mother got the Veal Piccata. She said her could have been better. Not bad, but bland and lackluster. My dad got the Mediterranean Pasta. He was very pleased with it.   

This place has so many selections that seem appealing. I really want to go back for a fancier dinner and get one of the very enticing meat entrees on the menu.

The event was held upstairs, and there were plenty of open tables on the dining room floor.

We got there at 5:10 and were put on the waitlist for the Ramen off. At around 5:25 we went up to the hostess stand (there were 3 hostesses) and asked if we could be taken off the list for the event and just dine in downstairs. The hostess asked us to hold on a ""moment"" and she would seat us. 20 minutes rolls by and it looks like she has no intention to seat us. I asked another hostess who said she couldn't seat us until the person who controlled the seating was back and she was currently on the phone. Again, at least half or more of the tables are open. Another 10-15 minutes till around and that second hostess seats us, in the back of the dining hall, without any apology or care we had to wait for over 30 minutes to sit. I also didn't understand why we were seated in the back when there were plenty of open tables in the front of the restaurant. 

Our service was decent but I felt like she was in a rush. I understand it might have been stressful because an event was taking place upstairs.

The cocktails are good depending on what you get, but I don't know if they're ""$14 good."" 

The food we ordered was the Tuna Tartare (it was excellent, and my favorite), the Shumai dumplings (my friend liked these, I didn't care for them), the hash browns (these were also very delicious and a nice spin on a traditional American food), and the spicy crab noodles (also pretty good).

All in all, the food is good, the restaurant is beautiful, but for me I appreciate an overall experience and if I feel like a burden to the staff I guarantee you I won't come back no matter how good the food can be.

Even on a day where the temps were near 50 the place just lured you in on many levels. Waiting in line for 25' left me to wonder if it will be worth it and let me tell you folks it was. 
There are a few tables inside to sit and enjoy your treat but they are snagged up before people get their cold treats. They do not have tables or chairs outside so it's pretty much walk and lick once you get you order. 
The price isn't that bad. $3,60 for a single scoop but it's generous.  They have a menu board for you to look at while in line and if they run out of a flavor, which happens a lot when standing in line, it is immediately deleted from that board. So don't get your hopes up that you will get that blueberry cheesecake flavor. They have the standard flavors and then they have their own concoctions. Once at the counter you do realize you pay extra for everything. Come 30 cents, waffle 99 cents etc. they can do shakes floats boats etc. you can also taste test flavors if you're not sure. Sorry there aren't any soy based flavors so for this lactose intolerant sweetie I wasn't able to get any.  But my daughter did. She chose the standard cookies and cream and cookie dough. I did taste the blueberry cheesecake and it was the creamiest and cold just the right hardness ice cream I've ever had. You could tell they have perfected the art of ice cream making. My daughters visual had huge chunks of Oreo and cookie dough packed inside the luscious creamy ice cream. 
They did sell other things like coffee and fruit shakes but I didn't see one person walk away with those in hand. In fact the coffee is kept in a carafe and you get it on your way out. So there isn't a great deal of selling other menu items going on. 
I would recommend stopping here anytime you're visiting. It is worth the wait and the price is pretty good. The staff is also very friendly and they have patience with the masses. Now go enjoy that treat.",2018-04-04 14:48:52

Good? Not really. Nothing wrong with serving this kind of food, but for these prices ($32-$52 per entree), there is something definitely wrong.  I felt that it least deserved an explanation. This place left me feeling conned.  The food didn't look or taste like quality ingredients. In fact, I was convinced the ""wild mushrooms"" where canned but the woman who never identified herself but stood at my table and defended the food claimed they were ""fresh"". If they were, they managed to take fresh mushrooms and make them have the taste and consistency of canned. The lack of creativity and skill the chef has was apparent throughout the meal. The lobster bisque should really just have been saffron bisque as that was all you could taste. A little saffron goes a long way and it was so overpowering you could smell it before it even hit the table. I do love saffron but if there was any lobster in this bisque, I will never know. Then came some weird ""salad"" that I wasn't even sure what the point was. The presentation was basically this, let's take a cheap bread plate, grab a fistful of mixed greens (you know the kind, you can buy it pre bagged from any local grocery) throw it on there, add a cherry tomato and a few cucumber slices and douse some balsamic on it. Classy. Finally came an uninspired, not perfectly butchered filet mignon. The meat didn't have the feel of good quality and it was served with a few new potatoes thrown on the plate and unappetizing looking asparagus. Really? A chef owned restaraunt and all your imagination could conjur up was red potatoes and some asparagus?! Fine, but I can get the same quality & inspiration at Outback for half the price. A plate like this really makes you feel ripped off. The hubbs had the la zupta, pasta dish with mussels, scallops, shrimp, clams, calamari & unidentifiable fish nuggets (his words). The mussels were over cooked and calamari inedible. I asked to speak to the chef since I was so confused with the meal I just encountered. He couldn't be bothered to come out and face what he had served I guess. It's ok chef, your lack of confidence was evident in the food you just served me. Instead, some woman who never identified herself materialized at the table (never acknowledged that I had asked for the chef or explained why she was there instead) and after trying to explain that for these prices I was expecting more then a meh meal, I watched her just grow irritated and defend the food. I told her that I wanted to give them honest feedback and a chance to make it better before I wrote the review. What would have made it better for me was to have the chef that I asked for come out and speak to me. That, to me, at least shows that they care enough to present themselves and perhaps want to improve. She didn't handle the situation well and it really just made my feelings about this place worse. All in all, if you want to stroke their unearned ego I'm sure they'd be glad to listen. Clearly, a negative review is irrelevant to them, perhaps because on further inspection of their high reviews on here, they look suspiciously cooked.  Either way, it's middle of the road chain quality food for unwarranted high prices. I cook better food at home. Oh and the service wasn't that great either, not worst i've ever had but not good.

This is where I received what will forever be known as ""the physically impossible sandwich""... and it sucked. 

I ordered the meatball sandwich, just looking for something simple that's impossible to screw up. How can you screw up a meatball sandwich? Well, these knuckleheads found a way. 

On the plate placed before my lay two large meatballs, a bowl of sauce and two two-inch thick slabs of bread... OK, so what the bejesus am I supposed to do with this? There was no sandwich, but materials to assemble a sandwich... but that would be impossible. If I assembled said sandwich, the sandwich would be like 5 or 6 inches thick. 

My wife suggested cutting the meatballs into quarters to reduce the potential disaster ratios that lay before me... Didn't work. Still two thick for any human without a disjointed jaw. Hmmmm... Maybe open faced?... no, too messy and the meat to bread ratio was still off... Maybe try to cut the bread length wise? Now we're just getting silly.

So, after 10 or 15 minutes of trying to figure out how to eat the $9 sandwich that wasn't even a sandwich, I came to grips with the fact that the reason my non-sandwich sandwich was not served to me as a sandwich was because it was physically impossible.

How do we even define what a sandwich is? ... I'm not going there. 

So, I ate the ingredients separately - and it was mediocre at best. Worst was the bread. Incredibly bland and dry. I commented to my wife that it could make decent home insulation material. 

My wife had lasagna and suspected it had been frozen and microwaved.

All said and done, our bill was like $40... for two pieces of bread, two meatballs, two beers, and microwave lasagna.

And that's not with the labor and frustration of me contemplating ""the physically impossible sandwich.",2014-10-19 01:39:36

Got the mussels appetizer which was great - tasted fresh and was smothered in a delicious white wine broth. I opted for the crab cakes which were full of lump crab meat and not a lot of filling. They were fantastic. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies, as well as a tasty, basic starter salad. The folks at our table ordered chicken piccata, scallops, a seafood pasta - everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals. The prices were very reasonable and the staff was friendly and attentive.

You hear nothing but country music and rock and roll. There are times when there are literally 65-70% black and Latino customers and all you hear is music that caters to whites. There have slowly added women of color to the team of waitresses but they don't seem to stick around very long. One night, my friends and I came in for fight night and the place was jammed packed. They took our money at the door and there were no seats available for us to sit in. So we had to stand and hope that four people would leave so that we could be seated. Managers were rude when we asked about it. Probably because there were cops with them that were working in the building that night which is not surprising. We finally spot a table of four leaving and then four guys that had just walked in the building and who just so happened to be white men hurried up and sat at that table and we told them that we were there before they were and management told us that they were there before we were. We knew this wasn't true but it put us all in a potentially bad situation. We are not trouble makers but we were very angry. Especially since all they had to do is write down names at the door and keep track of tables. We saw a waitress arguing with another group of black men for the same reason at the same time and they told us the same thing had happened to them. The point of this review is this: Far too many times black people are treated as if their money is different. The music reflects that and the service does as well. We need to have our own establishments but the city wouldn't allow this to happen due to the ""good old boy system with land and properties"".

The pork belly and fried oysters tasted unexpectedly pretty good together. The sweetness from the cha siu complimented the oysters. When you eat any type of seafood, there will be this fishy taste to it. Due to the bbq flavor from the cha siu, I didn't taste any fishiness from the oysters. 

The herbed mushroom pasta only came with a poached egg, so I decided to add the shrimps for some protein. Big mistake. I love salty food, but the grilled shrimps were just too way salty. The mushroom pasta itself tasted delicious. Maybe that's why I should not add any extra topping. 

The tequila mule was really good. I love cocktails that do not just straight up taste like alcohol. If they put too little alcohol, you won't be able to smell it. If they put too much, then the alcohol taste will be too overwhelming. The tequila mule was just perfect. It was sweet, strong, and ready ""to kill ya"".

The food is good - not great - and not quite (but close!) to equal in taste/quality to the price.

I made my reservation for a party of 6 two months ago after hearing incredible reviews from co-workers and friends. I was eagerly anticipating a first class experience, an upscale version of another local favorite,Two-Ten Jack. Unfortunately, due to the restaurant management's incompetence and extremely rude and unprofessional attitudes, I left this establishment very disappointed. 

Our reservation was at 7:30pm, and when we arrived, the hostess informed us that our table ""was being cleared now"" and to take a seat at the bar for a few minutes. After a quick bathroom break, our party ordered a round of drinks from the bar to help us maintain our patience as the minutes melted off of the clock. After 20 minutes of waiting; I approached the host to inquire about the delay in seating. The response was gruff, he rudely informed me that a previous party was still closing out at the table and we would have to continue to wait. I then asked if he would comp our first round of drinks; and again the response was rude and unprofessional- ""It's out of my control....Sir!"" the manager exclaimed as he shook his head and walked towards the kitchen. 

My party and I continued to wait; ordering a second round of drinks while the waitstaff struggled to get their act together. 50 minutes later, at 8:20pm, the manager finally moped back to the bar; mumbling as he led us upstairs to a completely different section of the restaurant. Before we headed upstairs, I asked him what he would do to help rectify the situation. ""The first round of drinks is on me, but I will NOT cover the second."" Ridiculous.... 

Once we were seated, I must confess that the remainder of our time was quite enjoyable. From our friendly waiter, Spencer, delicious small plates, and smooth Japanese Whiskey- the second act of the night met my expectations. The heated toilet seats were also a big hit with the ladies. However, none of these positives could cleanse my palate of the sour taste left over from the management's poor demeanor. We shook our heads as we departed; disheartened. I truly believe that the Green Pheasant could fly high with the best of them, as long as it's management stopped clipping it's own wings.",2019-11-03 17:52:14

They have an entire wall of draft wines which is a very interesting concept, and though I am not a huge wine fan, I can see how people would be extremely enthused. The patio is gorgeous with a lot of plants and it feels as if it is in the heart of the city with the nearby buildings and bustling street. I highly recommend getting the fig and brie cheese flatbread, the 3 cheese gnocchi, or the crab deviled eggs as the appetizer.

Tony's has heavily dated decor and a cigar soiled smell that was completely unappetizing... Perhaps they should bottle up the smell and sell it to those trying to lose weight? 

The food was below average too, only further putting the kibosh on my appetite. I ordered the salmon with a double side of vegetables and a salad. The salad was 100% iceburg lettuce, which is fine because I love the crunch-factor... But I was so very disappointed with my entree, no crunchy iceburg could make up for it. The salmon was HORRIBLY COOKED and I could tell they simply took a pre-frozen piece of fish from an individually sealed package, threw it on a griddle and called it good to go. When it arrived in front of me, I was heavily disappointed to see a HUGE FISH COOKING FAUX-PAS.... The salmon albumin all over my plate! I would have also been disappointed by the tiny serving ($17.99 a plate) but I could certainly not stomach more than what was given to me. 

As for the other dishes, I heard nothing but NEGATIVE comments (one dining companion even imitated what Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares might say, it was hilarious but ANYTHING BUT complimentary), aside from the RAVIOLI apparently being fantastic, but if that's the only item that's good on this huge menu, it's definitely not worth trying out. 

The reason for the 2 star rating is because I came to this restaurant with a party of 15, half under the age of ten, and we only had ONE SERVER who never once got flustered or annoyed by our crazy commotion!

They had our table set up in a separate room with another group which was fine, plenty of room. The first mistake they made was allowing us to order direct from the menu. In our past experience at other restaurants, we have been given a limited menu which allows the kitchen a better opportunity to get everyone's food out in a timely manner. When we arrived our table was set up but had no menus on the table and no waters. Our waiter came over to take drink orders and everything seemed like it might start to be normal. He left with our drink orders and drinks slowly made their way to our table, still no waters or menus. Everyone immediately ordered a second drink because the first drink took so long. Finally, menus arrived...still no water and no one asked if we wanted water. I noticed that our waiter was basically by himself to handle our entire table. Again, at other restaurants, we are used to having 2 or 3 servers handle our large group. We ordered appetizers, again they slowly made their way to the table. We ordered our main courses. Entrees started to make their way to the table and it quickly became apparent that only half the table received their main course. The waiter came over and stated he messed up and lost half our orders, he took the orders a second time for those of us that did not receive any food. Again, these orders slowly made their way to the table and they were still missing 5 people. We sat down at 6pm it is now 8pm, two hours in a 5 people didn't have their food. The waiter and manager came over this time to ask once again what we were missing. 3 of the 5 ordered again, myself and one other guest decided not to re-order. I have worked in the food & beverage industry and have had many group gatherings at restaurants over the years and I have to say that Macaroni Grill was the least prepared to handle a group I have ever seen. When companies like ours plan these parties it is usually once a year and it is an important event to show our appreciation to our employees, to have it go so painfully wrong is not only upsetting but unacceptable for a restaurant like Macaroni Grill. One server assigned to our table, no menus on the table, no waters on the table, our guests having to go to the bar to get their own water and drinks, missing food orders, 2 hours into the party and guests still without food. This says to me very clearly that Macaroni Grill is improperly managed and they do not have a clue as to how to handle a group party. The manager ultimately took 25% off the bill and the waiter removed a couple of wines and coffee, none of which made the evening any less intolerable. As poorly as our group was handled they should be embarrassed that they charged us at all.",2018-12-10 19:56:01

The second I went was this past Sunday for some food after bike riding. It was still brunch hours-I got the eggs benedict, my boyfriend got their special cheesesteak omelette, and we split the sausage and pepper spring rolls.  First off sausage and peppers is one of my very favorite foods so to see them offered in a unique way was really cool and they were really good. My eggs benedict was good too, but my boyfriends cheesesteak omelette, topped with their homemade wiz sauce, was beyond.

CWXPtC2xuaCY-ZB5V1IJNA,CWAPMrQyiI38Jh7LuDUIIg,aPNXGTDkf-4bjhyMBQxqpQ,4.0,2,0,1,"So this is going to be one of those places that polarizes people. Especially in this part of town. Some people have to understand what it is Craft Hall is trying to accomplish. This is young family experience during the day, and large group gathering place by night. This type of venue is not always accepted in this zip code. But I'm telling you, this is not a tourist trap and is a genuine establishment. It is also surrounded by some very tough competition with restaurants and bars in Fishtown and NoLibs. I have a pretty high standard when it comes to food and drink and I'm going to say outright that I like everything that is the Craft Hall concept. There is one issue, and that's the pricing of food. Cutting to the chase, here's what to expect:

Before you even get inside, there's one seating area where you can bring a beer or food outside, sit along Delaware ave and hang out next to the chickens and rabbits in their coops (you can't pet them but you can watch them hop around). It's slightly removed from the rest of the establishment but it could be a nice thing to do with kids if the weather is nice. It's quiet and doesn't smell like a chicken coop at all. I love all animals, so I think this is cool.

The Space:
As you walk into the enormous space I notice that it's air-conditioned very well. This was a problem in the space when it used to be Yards brewing. It's an old building, which I believe to be one of the last remnants of the Jack Frost Sugar refinery (someone fact check me?), and it would get uncomfortable at times. But the temperature inside was nice even on a 90 degree day. This converted warehouse is split up between different seating areas. One section has a number of couches to kick back on. Another is filled with high-top tables and a traditional L-shape bar. Towards the back there are low-top tables, a ping pong table, cornhole and a shuffleboard table. In the furthest corner separated from rest of the room is the playground and kids area. Beyond that through a single door on the back wall, is more outside seating that borders but is fenced off from Delaware Ave. I'd like to note that the playground is very separate from the bar area. I wasn't tripping on children while drinking my beer. I was also surprised that the noise level is reasonably quiet and pleasant. Aside from a twenty-something jokingly playing the baby shark song on the communal piano behind me.

The Food and Drink:
So Craft Hall hosts the Mainstay Independent Brewing company started up by former brew masters of Slyfox and the late great Saint Benjamin's Brewing. I'm going to say that if you think their beer is bad, you are just simply wrong. These are some of the best German style beers I've ever tried from an American brewery. And I've tried A LOT. They brew primarily classic German styles. Don't get me wrong, these styles aren't always user-friendly, but they have a great assortment here that should fit anyone's tastes (both hop-lovers and hop-haters) if you learn about what you're ordering. You might just have to ask the bartender a few questions and sample some first. The King Laird Hefeweizen is one of my all-time favorites now and is definite crowd pleaser. The food seems to be New American and comfort foods with some BBQ sprinkled in. They use Lost Bread Company bread for everything, which speaks for itself. The food is excellent and the only reason this place did not receive 5 stars from me is because the food is very expensive for relatively smaller portions. For this reason, I come here all the time now, but for the beer and atmosphere. It's odd to me about the pricing of the food because the beer and cocktails are very reasonable. You can get pitchers of many of their beers for $18. To-go pounder 4 packs are $10. Growlers of their flagships are $13. Why are hush puppies $10 and a tiny asparagus salad $12? I get snacks like the bread board or the pretzels but I usually don't eat a meal here. I love the menu but the pricing is just a little off for an order-and-take-a-number kind of place.  

The Service:
Bartenders were very cool. I talked quite a bit with a few different bartenders and they were all friendly and all knew what they were talking about when it came to food and drink. Like I said before, this place is an order-at-the-counter and grab a number kind of place, so it was nice that they all took time to talk to me despite being busy. 

The Overall:
I really like this place. If they were to adjust their food pricing on some items, I think I would happily update to 5 stars here. I would like this place to succeed, so hopefully this review clears up some misconceptions of the place. Comfortable seating, great beer, fun games, cool bartenders, decent food. Bonus points for chickens. Built for the young family outing, group happy hours, Sunday fundays or a beer after a jog along Delaware Ave. Just understand what it is people come here for and you'll really like this place too.",2019-07-02 18:25:23

My friend and I we both wanted to try  original new Orleans Po-boy.   Based  on yelp feedback it seems  to be the perfect  place.
We was Hangry.

 The place opening  at 11:00am 
My friend  and I came at 11:20am we were the first ones in. 
 We got greated in, everyone was very friendly and warm. 

My friend waited for her Coffee for 22min, reminding them every 10 min about the coffee ( apparently  they wasn't  ready to serve customers yet ) 

 Our waiter was very friendly, however he literally went all over the  menu recommending us what to get, instead of listening  what we actually want.

 So I ordered the fried Poboy shrimp & hand cut fries, my friend  order the frayed chicken Po-boy &  fried onions. And a green house dslad.

They brought the food fast. 
The green salad was great ! 
AND THAT IS ABOUT IT! 

THE HERO ON BOTH OF OUR SANDWICHES WAS OLD DRY AND HARD. 
**NO WHERE CLOSE TO BE FRESH**

We brought it to the waiter  attention, he took it the kitchen brought it back claimed  it is suppose to be this way, ‍ 
WE ASKED to cancel  the order.  

After we canceled  the manager cames with both of the sandwiches like nothing happened.  I saw is the same breed! instead of giving us a new bread, they just spray
oil on  top to look like new bread.
WHAT A SHAME !!!
 THE manager claim that the french bread look like that and ""it suppose  look not fresh, hard and dry""
 She claimed they make their own  bread and it is not old it just  should  look like that!!!

We started with: (1) Grandma's Wonton Soup (traditional fuzhou style pork wontons, scallions, celery), which was delightful--a very gentle broth and ghost-like wontons floating therein; (2) Pork Gyoza (kurobuta pork, scallions, ginger, pan-fried), which were nicely crisp, flavorful, and served piping hot; and (3) Wagyu Beef Spring Rolls (onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, mustard sauce), which included some delicious beef, however, the beef overwhelmed the rest of the spring roll.

We rolled on with: (a) Yellowtail & Chives house roll (avocado, chive oil), my favorite roll of the evening--that chive oil gave it a certain special something; (b) King Ghidorah specialty maki (spicy tuna, shishitos, hot sesame oil, topped with yellow-tail, jalapeño, tobiko), my second favorite roll; (c) Dynamite White Tuna house roll (spicy walu, crunch, shishitos), my third favorite roll; (d) Fishtown specialty maki (shrimp tempura, avocado, jalapeño, topped with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, spicy aioli), although this roll looked like it would have the most flavor, it didn't deliver on its looks, tasty, sure, but not my favorite; and (e) Eel Avocado classic maki.

I was a bit skeptical when I heard that it was wine on tap and thought that it would be like WINO, downtown. Cooper Vine is super chill and has a restaurant vibe to it, because it is a restaurant. I went for a work event and we had a private space upstairs. We ended doing a 4 wine flight where our servers brought unmarked bottles to the tables and we had to guess which wine we were consuming. 
Half glasses start off at $4-$5 and most bottles range from $36-$54 with wines from the east coast to the west coast and your usual South American, European , and South African wines. 
What I did not expect was to love the food. It was sooo good. We started off with french fries, deviled eggs and Brussels sprouts, which was absolutely divine. The Brussels are fried then baked and served with grated Parmesan. They were sooo good that you did not need the sauce that accompanied the sprouts.

Recently, they reorganized the place so there is more room for people to stand when waiting for orders. This definitely opens up the space that can filled with over 3-4 dozen at a busy time.

They have a mix of outdoor and indoor seating but based on how busy this place was on a Saturday morning, THEY NEED MORE SEATING! Be prepared to get territorial and fight for seating if necessary.

The biscuits were delicious as were the breakfast sandwiches that I ordered. The buns were sooooo soft. Who doesn't like brioche? The only item I'd suggest steering away from are the grits. They had a very vinegar taste to them. I'm guessing that's their take on grits but no one at our table was a fan. 

Definitely recommend stopping by even if it's just for a quick grab and go coffee. Super cool spot.",2019-09-12 04:24:59

Dylan was our waiter about an hour ago and he seemed fairly pleasant but not very attentive or understanding. While some of the food was decent, a lot wasn't and the service was pretty abysmal. 
We weren't told bottles of wine would come in an already open reusable bottle from a tap. I would think that there would have been a spiel like ""have you dined with us before? No? Well just to let you guys know all of our wine is on tap and not from a bottle...  blah blah blah""
We ordered wine and apps and got the apps before the wine. We were 100% done with all our appetizers before our server came back to take our main order. We tried to tell Dylan the red wine was un drinkable while he was taking our main orders and he said he would come around when it was our sides turn to order, but then practically ran away without giving us time to bring it up again. When we told him a second time and he seemed snarky. We all ended up ordering soup for our mains because we had such a long time after completing our apps we weren't really hungry anymore. Good for us (because we would have over ordered) bad for him (because his ppa went down and way less of a tip.) When our mains came two of us were splitting the poutine (cochon au lait debris fries) and while the plate was scorching the food inside was luke warm at best. We would have brought it up but he never asked if the food was good. He was MIA the rest of the meal (not that he was very present to begin with.) Or even friendly when he was present. Oh and eventually our other wine came but that took forever too. It was also very hard for us to get gross dirty plates taken away from the table. The French shallot(onion) soup had decent flavor but it was a tiny little dollop of cheese (not your normal smother in cheese and then baked French onion soup) floating on a Very chewy stale piece of bread that I couldn't cut at all.  Three cheese gnocchi was good. Although pretty watery and he didn't bring a spoon until I flagged him down about 10 minutes later. Over all not a fan.

Came to Copper Vine for Sunday brunch. Love the ambiance here and the patio area! My expectations were high as I've greatly anticipated dining here for quite some time. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, took his time to explain things, and made quality recommendations. For an appetizer, I had the filet mignon brochette as the waiter suggested; it was fantastic! It definitely set the bar. While waiting for our entrees (yes, my friend and I both ordered 2 entrees, don't judge), we occupied our time indulging in the bottomless mimosas which were also great. 

Entrees: I had the chicken and waffles as well as the crawfish and andouille gnocchi. The chicken was really good and paired well with the gravy that came with it. However, I was greatly underwhelmed by the waffle. It was super thin and crispy, almost like a wafer. I prefer thicker, more fluffy waffles. I ate the chicken and played over the waffle for those reasons. As for the gnocchi, I was not impressed at all. It was disappointing for me.

78B6JttMU5BZaHMQhXNKsg,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,seKihQKpGGnCeLuELRQPSQ,4.0,9,0,6,"If you happen to stumble into Twin Peaks expecting an otherworldly encounter with David Lynch, you're probably going to be disappointed. 

On the other hand, if you stumble into the brand new Indianapolis location of the Texas-based chain of ""breastaurants"" called Twin Peaks hoping to enjoy some good eats, good drinks, and scenic views, then you'll likely be incredibly happy. 

Founded in 2005 in Lewisville, Texas, Twin Peaks opened for the dinner hour starting on 12/8/14 at the former Loon Lake Lodge just East of Castleton at the corner of I-69 and East 82nd Street. 

With its servers all wearing the trademark Twin Peaks cleavage and midriff-baring red plaid tops and khaki shorts, the concept behind Twin Peaks may sound familiar but this variation on the familiar theme is far less kitschy and far more personable than other similarly themed restaurants.

The easiest way to describe Twin Peaks is sports bar meets hunting lodge meets bevy of beautiful women. For those who remember Loon Lake Lodge and its abundance of hunting-themed decor, it makes sense that Twin Peaks choose this spot as its first Indianapolis location. The restaurant has multiple truly accessible parking spots and a set of rather light doors leading into the larger than you expect restaurant. As they just started serving dinners only on Monday of this week and open for regular business hours starting Saturday (12/13/14), the spirit in the restaurant was festive and friendly with multiple staff from the chain's Dallas area headquarters on location for training purposes. Thus, you get greeted at the door by enough beautiful women to make you dream for weeks. 

I worried a little as I arrived as the first bar area and first couple dining areas feature high-top tables/chairs that aren't wheelchair friendly. There's no reason to worry. Twin Peaks has multiple areas that are wheelchair friendly and I had no trouble navigating the restaurant (and was encouraged to do so). 

The menu consists of mostly American fare of a South, Southwest, and Heartland flavor with burgers, chicken, appetizers, a few other sandwiches, and a handful of meals. There's a large alcohol menu, of course, and a couple of desserts. There are two main bar areas, at least 3-4 larger dining areas, a small area known as the ""man cave,"" and there are wide-screen televisions throughout the restaurant and in the bathrooms!

I ordered a concoction known as the Smokehouse Burger with ""fire fries"" for $10.95 plus another couple bucks for my usual iced tea. I tend to be a rather simple burger guy and this particular burger was a bit out of my comfort zone. This may explain why I didn't find it completely satisfying. It tasted a tad underdone. It included cheddar cheese, red onion, BBQ sauce, bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The burger was easily my least favorite part of the experience, though I'd still put it in the 3-3.5 range. The fries were perfectly seasoned and stellar. The iced tea was also perfection and I did receive my usual refill. 

The highlight of the entire experience was Amanda, and not just because she was beautiful (though she was). She was attentive, personable, outgoing, and just seemed natural. She also scored points for sitting down to talk to me, not just because it's really hard to sit in a wheelchair and have a normal conversation with a skimpily clad young woman but because being at wheelchair height causes the neck to constantly have to stretch and it's nice when someone meets you eye-to-eye. Unlike that ""other"" chain that comes to mind, these young women all seemed comfortable with disability and Amanda, in particular, seemed natural and at ease (NOTE: I did learn she has a brother who is deaf. I'm sure that helps). 

While it was a little slow during the 5pm hour in which I arrived at Twin Peaks, I was impressed with Amanda's personable nature and ability to talk about work, disability, sports, food and, yes, even what it's like to work in a place with an outfit that would make most of us blush. It was refreshingly awesome and, to be honest, not what I expected when I entered the doors. 

The service was stellar. The food was good, though I'll likely stick to my comfort zone next time. The decor was warm, inviting, and wheelchair friendly. The views, as their slogan notes, definitely scenic. While I do lean toward the shy side, I think it's human nature to appreciate a little extra attention and, as Twin Peaks notes on its website, the Twin Peaks girls offer an abundance of ""girl next door"" charisma and playful personalities.

So I agree with some of the other reviews, it is VERY hard to find amazing sushi in Philadelphia. It's just difficult to come by, while this sushi was not the best I have ever had, the experience was five stars. 

First, I love the ambience. This is a place that suits many occasions, first dates, get together with friends, lunch with a coworker, etc. I would say definitely more of an intimate setting, I came here with Megan F. for a lunch during a work break! Such great vibes. Love the bar area and full length windows, just adds to the ambience! 

We tried their steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and for rolls we split the J&J roll, peppered tuna roll, and the east roll. The east roll is just your standard salmon sushi roll, nothing too crazy.  The J&J is a great roll for people trying to transition into the sushi eating world of actual raw fish! Loved the seared tuna on the outside. Hands down, our favorite was the peppered tuna roll! I'm a spicy tuna roll enthusiast and I decided to switch it up with this roll. I have zero regrets, a definite must try and great chance of tuna palette.


Overall the place and the sushi varieties are very modern, definitely worth a try if you're near this area of philly!",2018-04-02 18:25:32

We got lost finding the entrance so we called inside. The host gave great directions and even said ""are you in the black jacket? I see you!"" So sweet!

We had a reservation and got seated right away. The indoor is absolutely beautiful! 

I started off with a cocktail (could not remember which one) and we split the tuna tartare. We also got the pork gyoza to split. Both were AMAZING and we tore through them in probably minutes. 

I ordered a wonton soup as a starter. By the time our entrees came it had not, so I asked about it. He said they were out of wonton soup (weird) but it was also 10 pm, so it was fine! 

For our main course, my roommate got shrimp tempura and I got the fish town roll. I was not expecting that much heat, so be careful!! I ended up taking the jalapeños off but it was still delicious! 

After that, I had consumed quite a few drinks, and was getting drunk hungry. I last minutes ordered the fried rice with the egg on top. Amazing!!! Satisfied every craving! I even left with some to go (that I finished before I went to bed )

After a awhile a waiter showed up , not sure if it was his first night or he just sucked as a waiter .

This isn't a traditional New Orleans cuisine, but you can certainly taste the influences. Flavors are a bit more light and fresh rather than spicy and in your face. The chicken and boudin gumbo appetizer was not mom's gumbo, but pretty good. Paige got the Wagyu burger while I got the Gulf Fish Bouillabaisse. Both great.

We opted to try several rolls: salmon avocado, Sindy, Rittenhouse and the unagi sashimi. The sushi and sashimi were beautifully presented on a wooden board. Sindy was my favorite roll as it was super light because it didnt have rice. We noticed the salmon may not have been as fresh as the tuna that day. Overall, it was good though.

When I made the reservation I asked about vegan options because I didn't see anything on the menu. The person who took the reservation assured me there were vegan menu items so I assumed the menu online was outdated or didn't have all items listed.

When we arrived at the restaurant, I was disappointed that our vaccine cards weren't checked- there was no request for anything like that. We waited for a few minutes in a lounge area near the bathroom before being seated, and were seated pretty quickly after that. We placed drink orders and then a lot of time went by while we waited to order appetizers. I eventually had to get up to ask someone if we could place an appetizer order. 

When ordering dinner, I asked about the vegan options. The only menu item that is vegan as-is was a bowl of olives. Our server said there were no vegan options. I asked her if she could check with the kitchen because the person that took the reservation was very reassuring about vegan items. She came back and said they could do a vegetable plate with ""what we have in house."" When I asked, she said it was carrots and green beans. I asked if there were possibly grains or beans in addition to the veggies? Nope. Just two veggies apparently. I let her know how disappointed I was she was defensive and not apologetic or kind about it at all. I would have expected more from a restaurant that has a chef in-house, especially when it was not busy in the restaurant, and because I had called ahead. 

I ended up getting a salad without bacon and cheese (of course it is the same price without those ingredients - hello vegan tax!) and having some fries left over from our appetizers. It reminded me of the early 2000s when fries and a side salad were the only meat-free items I could order at most restaurants. 

The best part of my meal (aside from spending time with my friends!) was two wonderful glasses of wine. The food and especially the service was so underwhelming. I have previously really enjoyed sitting outside on the patio with my wine, but I just don't think I'll be back after this.",2021-11-11 21:24:27

Bottom line: almost everything is great- except the $20 cheese/meat board. We received *literally* two pieces of cheese. I asked about it and the bartender awkwardly pawned me off to another employee who didn't know what to say, so they just named the meats and cheeses placed on the board to add in some filler words.

Except this cabin was complete with the elite hooter restaurant waitresses lol. With that being said the servers here are amazing! Hands down  top notch service not just good to look at. These are really well trained servers that understand customer service they even make time for small talk. They kind of double teamed my table the whole time and were really on top of making sure my glass stayed refreshed and I got everything I needed before I actually needed it.

The wings are the star here you can get them a variety of ways.... breaded, non breaded, bone in or out, and the champ of them all smoked then grilled with a array of sauces, naked, or dry rubbed!!

I have ordered salads and sandwiches and they were good. Yes they are a bit pricy but then many of Nashville's trendier restaurants are and even some of the less trendy. I would go back because I can get a good salad and sit down and enjoy it while I am on my lunch break. The atmosphere is fantastic. The staff super friendly and helpful. I am only knocking off one star because they are pricy. I would recommend them for sure. My only real negative comment would be they have no way of assuring that the food people eat is being paid for. It is based on the honor system. Students love to dine and dash.

I've been here three times, and I've grown to like it more and more with each visit.

The wine options are very solid. I appreciate the fact that they are not so numerous as to be overbearing: I typically don't like being presented with a long list of wines that doesn't seem particularly curated. For each wine type, they have 1-3 options at different price points. Another great selling point is that you can try each wine in different sizes; in other words, you don't have to fully commit to any one wine if you want to be more experimental.

The food offerings are delicious. I've gotten a few flatbreads and have never been disappointed. The duck fat fries are mouthwatering. For entrées, I've only gotten the bouillabaisse, but it exceeded my expectations. 

The food can seem a little pricey, but it is honestly on par with the area. Additionally, the wines are reasonably priced and there is a good happy hour special.

5/5 STARS!

Food: First and foremost, their food is amazing. I have been to many sushi spots in the greater city and Philadelphia area but Tuna Bar's sushi has the best overall quality and taste. Their speciality rolls are to die for. My personal favorites are the Sindy Roll, Rittenhouse Roll, and Hurts Roll. As for favorite appetizers, it is definitely the tuna flatbread and their oysters. Yum. 
 
Drinks and Cocktails: The best part about going to an amazing restaurant for food is having an amazing alcohol and drink selection to complement the meal. Personal favorite cocktails are the yuzu sour and the race street. If you're a sake fan then definitely ask them about their wide variety of sake. Cheers! 

Ambience: The ambience and the atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing. The ""vibes"" are great. They are always playing great music that sets a positive mood for everyone. Big ups to whomever created that playlist! 

Service: Last but certainly not the least, their service. Simply wow. Tuna bar has the best service. I have to give Ken, the owner, a thumbs up for creating such an amazing establishment with an amazing team. Their General Manager, Tina, was phenomenal. Her professionalism, positive attitude, and seasoned experience can be seen from a mile away. I remember on a busy Saturday night, she was juggling 5 things at once, but still managed to provide my family and I an amazing time. She was super friendly! The rest of the staff were A+ too!

As usual, fantastic lattes with oat milk! 
Great service...many familiar faces.  Thank you Sierra!
They do offer some gluten free sweets like a gluten free brownie (but do not think it is vegan...).  Really encouraging places to offer some gluten free vegan options when they can. 
The breads are amazing.  If you are not strict gluten free, their sourdough is a good option given how sourdough is made. And it is one of the few times, I will skip my usual gluten free needs and dive into their breads.  The sandwiches made on their breads take the idea of a ""sandwich"" and bring it to the next level.  So good.  
Still a local favorite spot mixed with some interesting visitors that have now discovered this treat!

oh by the way if there is a line, it moves fast (usually).

Tip: Order Online for Take Out in advance.  Then stroll to the beach for a nice walk.  Take the route along State street to enjoy some nice window shopping OR go the side street past Lucky Penny & Shopkeepers (great store), then to the beach..just a few blocks away.

We hadn't been there in a year and it has definitely gone downhill. Last Sunday I decided to order the dish pictured (the mushroom ravioli) via Doordash. Ordering went fin, but when it arrived, it seemed a little light for a dish that might resemble the dish featured on their menu, especially one costing $21. I opened it up and I saw this monstrosity. Only a few pieces of ravioli, burnt to the point of being inedible with a dash of (also burnt) mushroom gravy. I immediately called up the restaurant and demanded an explanation. I was told that the General Manager cooked this particular dish and that I would be getting a refund in a week. 
Well, it's been a week. I called and was told it might be another couple of weeks before I get my refund because the folks in the corporate office are only occasionally in the main office anymore. I did get an offer for them to remake my order. No thanks. Fool me once . . . 
I will never be eating here again and I don't recommend anyone else do until they either hire new management or, at least, banish the GM from the kitchen. They clearly don't know how to cook or about appropriate portions

Update: even though they told me to contact them on their website, I did and have yet to get any sort of response whatsoever. I even called the restaurant again. No call back. Two weeks from the original incident. Still no refund.",2020-04-27 06:30:55

Second try and this place just doesn't do it for me so it's story time.  Cause I'm in quarantine so this review is going to be a long one. 

Spark notes: Expensive bad food. 

I remember when they opened. So happy to see the skeezy place before it replaced.  Like a basic bitch I oooed at the thought of cocktails in the beautiful outdoor courtyard. 

If you're not with your gal pals, you're on a date.  That's just the type of place this is.  Like I said the courtyard is insta worthy and if you didn't happen to notice, the building preserved its historic charm.  Stand on poydras and admire those beams... 

Unfortunately, that's where my love ends.  The first experience, a date, was disappointing to say the least.  Not the date, the food. Which is worse. Bad date I can handle, bad food? No ma'am. 

You're in a beautiful courtyard what do you order? Charcuterie of course.  Let's feel like we're under the Tuscan sun surrounded by grape leaves... 

Back to reality, you're in New Orleans and this meat and cheese plate is nothing like Italy.  Forget fresh prosciutto or cheese from a sheep.  They can't even serve bread that's not stale.  Before you hiss at me, yes crostini is toasted.  I know the difference. My date and I agreed, this hard bread just wasn't going to do.  After waiting longer than I'd like for food that doesn't require cooking, we got more bread but there was no difference.  I'm sure we ate some other stuff but it wasn't memorable.

After first experience left me unimpressed, we never went back.  We would drive by and comment about our bad memory. Expensive bad food. 

Fast forward to Quarantine 2020.  I'm surfing IG because that's honestly all I do now. Some places are starting to offer family meals. We eat out often so more food for less money sounds like a good plan.  

20% off food at copper vine, let's give it another try. I called to place an order and the person answering the phone was not aware of family meals and when I asked about todays was told it's pork chops not pulled pork? Unfortunately I ordered from some where else.  This place upset me again. 

Is there a character limit on these reviews??? If you're still reading you must be in quarantine still. 

So I decide to say something about it. Cause I've never been one to keep my mouth shut.  Sent them a DM on IG.  Fast response. So sorry for the confusion. How about a free meal? Sweet! Yes please.  Never asked my name...Swing by to pick up my meal prepared for the worst.  Manager must have been expecting me.  Although my order was for a specific pick up time, I might as well have ordered when I got there. Ended up waiting 20mins and there were zero other people waiting. 

Time to eat. Fried Fish, Mac, green beans, bread pudding.  Edible. Certainly not worth normal price tag. Bread pudding was beyond dry.  This is where their stale bread could come in handy yet they somehow made it more dry... drench that shit in whiskey sauce and eat my free meal.  

The strong will (hopefully) survive this quarantine.  I'd be shocked if it's copper vine.",2020-04-17 19:07:08

I am screaming at the top of my lungs for The Green Pheasant. Alas, I have found my date night spot. Now, if only I had a date to take with me!

That was pretty exciting first paragraph, wasn't it? The breakdown is pretty clear. When you arrive, valet the car with the restaurant. Just do it and quit groaning at the suggestion. This will make your life a whole lot easier for a stress-free starter to your date. Go to the hostess desk where they will seat you for your reservation that you made 2 weeks ago. As they take you to your table, observe the ambiance. Will they take you to the upstairs with the quirky bathrooms? Will they take you to the main dining room where there is a central bar to people watch or are they going to take you to your private dining room with the awesome wallpaper of CCTV cameras and roses? Yes, you read that right. If you are able, take some photos in there because the wallpaper is totally worth a photo of. Most of the restaurant should find itself in a covershoot in Nashville Scene. Who doesn't love green and red velvet everywhere!?

Now that you're seated, take it all in. Check out the menu and inhale all of the quirky offerings on the menu. But before ordering food, get your sake order in and prepare for a toast! You can get that unique cocktail you were eyeing in the next round. This round is about sharing the moment you realized you're about to have one of the best damn dining experiences in Nashville. Kanpai! ('Cheers' in Japanese)

You've looked over the menu and you're going to order 4-5 items between you and your dining companion. They offer everything from vegetarian to what I'd consider a very large unsightly fish on a plate ready for consumption. I don't like whole fish, but the table next to us certainly did! Whatever you palette wishes is Green Pheasant's command.

The experience exceeds just the dining portion. Let's talk service. Carlos was exceptional. Beyond words, topnotch, never missed a beat, glowing service. He was hospitable, prompt, and very nurturing to our table. He never hoovered and we never had to ask for anything. He was like a genie who appeared when I had a fleeting thought of needing a beverage or another glass of water. We also appreciated his knowledge of the cuisine and his mindfulness of our spice-level tolerance. We ordered based on his recommendations and we loved every last thing he suggested.

After 2.5 hours of eating and drinking, it is time to go. Time to wrap up and get going. But, you do not exit without leaving a gigantic tip for the awesome server you just had, and you do not omit grabbing a couple of photos of yourself with your dining partner to capture the experience that will be ingrained in your culinary memory for a life time. Bask in the moment while you can. You'll return soon, but in the meantime, enjoy the moment at this moment.

Have fun? I know I did. Check it out and do it soon!",2019-01-22 14:51:28

We gave this place one more go after a couple inconsistencies throughout 8 or 9 orders (missing ingredients a few times, wait times for to go always seemed like our food had been sitting way too long - plus usually nobody out front, they all hang out in the kitchen)...honestly when the food was good, it was really really good, ya know? 

Too bad we chanced it again and had the same issues today, thankfully we caught it at the car and went back inside to recover 2 missing ingredients. They took care of the quinoa for my boyfriend's salad but said the avocados they had weren't ripe enough yet, and both entrees listed avocado. Somehow this wasn't noted by anyone or relayed to us while ordering. My boyfriend asked for some sort of compensation for that and the instances before - not a full refund, just to help with the repetitive inconveniences. Note that we never asked for a full refund, at any point...

Somehow the manager could not comprehend this. He offered to take back the food and then grabbed the bag from me, and I snatched it back because we had already paid and he refused to hear us out. I simply didn't want to return my food after being told a 25 minute wait time that seemed horribly inaccurate given the sparse state of the restaurant. 

What resulted was a bit of chaos and confusion. Everyone got more frustrated trying to get to the source of the problem then he began mocking us as I explained our experiences in the past, quoting my words back and laughing. He couldn't understand why we would come back if we had noticed anything wrong to begin with. The reason was me giving them the benefit of the doubt because anyone who's worked in restaurants knows that it can be variable and stressful... Joke's on us though as proven by his incredulous laughter, followed by ""I'll just get you the full refund. I know what kind of people you are and what you want."" 

At that point I felt we're dealing with a personal bias more than anything else. He would rather pay $30 back to us to be rude and unapologetic, rather than admit any fault or discuss the matter logically. Also, when someone says ""I've been in the restaurant business for years"" as a defense tactic when I ask why I'm being laughed at... it doesn't give them credibility. It feels like pulling at straws because they don't know the right way to handle a lack of communication from their employees. Terribly unprofessional, and a horrible experience, but maybe that's why they're in a place with guaranteed business from the sports rather than trying to make it on their own.",2019-07-18 22:52:10

The menu is relatively small, but from our experience, everything was made with thought and care. We started off with cocktails, the tequila for us both. While the smell let us know it was a generous pour, it was easy to drink and not overly sweet. We split 4 rolls in total: Fishtown, peppered tuna, dynamite tuna, and spicy salmon. The presentation was beautiful, and every roll was delicious, although my favorite was the Fishtown. It was clear that all of the fish and other ingredients were fresh!

I came here on a Sunday morning at around 10:30 and it was PACKED - line was well out the door. I live within walking distance so I turned right back around to go home and placed an online order for pickup ~45 min later. 

We got the elvis style banana bread, wildflower honey ricotta on sourdough toast, and the green eggs and ham on a biscuit. I was most pleasantly surprised by the elvis because it's not something I would have normally ordered but the flavors complemented each other so well and the banana bread itself was great. It was a huge chunk of bread so it was also a more filling dish than I expected. We both loved the ricotta toast, which was light and more dessert like. The sourdough bread was very impressive - very soft on the inside with lots of crunch on the outside. Lastly, the green eggs and ham was great with the green harissa sauce and there was a huge piece of fluffy egg. It's not a sauce I've had before on a breakfast sandwich and I was a fan! Sadly it did not come with a biscuit like the online website says, but brioche instead. That might be the new default and you might need to specially request the biscuit, despite the website description.

I called ahead for a reservation but they were booked up for most of the night.   I was told we could sit at the bar and it would be best to come early.   We actually arrived before their dinner hours began, so we sat at the bar and ordered from their small plates.  

Mike was very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  He concocted a great non-alcoholic drink for me, which I ordered a few of over the course of our meal!   I can't remember exactly what it was, I believe it was made of cranberry juice, soda water, and a generous sprig of rosemary (picture attached).

We started with the edamame, yaki gyoza (pheasant dumplings), tuna tartare, and lobster shumai (lobster and corn dumplings).  Everything was nicely plated and tasted wonderful.

Next up were the famed spicy crab noodles.  Upon arrival of this dish, we quickly realized: a) that it was so good that we had to order another, b) that it was so good that my spouse was going to eat it all so we had to order another, and c) that it was so good that I wasn't going to want to share the dish with my spouse, so we had to order another!  So, we immediately ordered another!   

Also--interesting find--the toilet seats were heated!

1. $4 parking (0-60min)- No validation
2. Dining area had too much furniture and was not clean.
3. The shelves with drinks, chips, etc. looked like they were having a close out sale. Empty.
4. Rude employees...
5. Trash cans were overflowing and they didn't even have openings big enough to accommodate the containers the food was served in.
6. If one of your family members order a salad, and the other a sandwich, you can't pay for them together. It's weird.

The food was decent once we got it but honestly, not all that great considering the hassle you have to go through to get it and eat. There are a million great places to eat in Nashville...I'd put this low on the list.",2019-08-19 19:05:21

The space is sleek, cool and comfortable. The nonstop ""house"" music was a bit much, and made it somewhat hard to hear dinner conversation, but we understood the vibe that they were shooting for and took it all in stride. The menu is a fantastic mix of classic Japanese izakaya dishes with some larger plates that are great for sharing. I'm not a big fan of menus that list the name of the dish followed by all of the ingredients without an actual description of the preparation, but our server was very familiar with the menu and talked us through everything. We had two of their craft cocktails; they were spot on perfect. Each was a great mix of sweet, sour, bitter and refreshing. 
We ordered Dan Dan Shishito peppers; very reminiscent of Dan Dan Mian,  without the heaviness of the noodles. A great started. That was followed by lobster and spot prawn shu mai; unlike many restaurant dishes that claim to feature lobster, the succulent crustacean was very present in this one. Then a riff on okonomiyaki; a hash brown pancake with traditional okonomiyaki toppings and sauces. It was like an asian latke; perfect for this time of year. We finished with the whole trout, fried and served with thinly sliced cucumbers, asian slaw and steamed buns. The trout was cooked perfectly; it was silky and juicy. One thing to note; for a restaurant that features a sharing menu, a puzzling number of items came out in odd numbers. 5 shu mai, three steamed buns with the trout; Management-how about 6 shu mai and 4 steamed buns so a pair of enthusiastic and hungry diners don't have to fight over the ""odd bun out""?

I like the very laid back and relaxed atmosphere here. The inside of the place is decorated like a tropical beach house with a straw roof bar area, surf boards, and painted fish and palm tree murals. Background music with rock music and Buffett tunes resonates throughout the place. There are colorful wooden patio chairs and there's outside seating with flaming lamps and a spectacular view of the traffic out on Pottstown Pike and the Kmart across the road. 

I sat up at the bar so I could watch the sports highlights on the TV. There are several beers on tap including Landshark, Miller Lite, Coors Light, Sam Adams, and Yuengling Lager.

Turkey and veggie burger options available at no additional cost.

I did not order a cheeseburger, but I went for the Fish Tacos ($10.99), 3 of them served with island rice. The fish tacos were stuffed grilled flour tortillas (soft and crispy) with spicy grilled fish, cabbage, and pineapple salsa, served with a tangy orange dressing on the side. The rice was lacking flavors, but otherwise a healthier accompaniment than fries. The service at the bar was laid back.

We had noticed that the parking lot was PACKED the first few months it was open and initial Yelp reviews were touting Indy's newest breast-aurant as the place to be.  Also, we were curious to see how the cool old Loon Lake Lodge had been transformed in to the new space.

We visited at about 6:30 on a balmy 89 degree Sunday night and were seated on the large wrap-around patio at a huge, tall, heavy wooden table.  There are TVs EVERYWHERE -- hanging back to back over each of our heads, 4 on the wall beside us -- just EVERYWHERE.  The tables on the patio are massive and easily sit 6, and some inside (inside it is HUGE!) looked to seat 10+ or more -- with several smaller parties divided up by a slider depicting an ax through the table.  There was a fire pit at the corner of the patio as well.  

Our scantily clad yet overdressed for the weather (more on this later) little teeny-tiny server was completely friendly, but lacked menu knowledge aside from ""these 2 sandwiches have an egg on them and if you like fish we have trout and fish tacos"".  We later learned that sweet ""Bambi"" had just been in training last week, so we cut her some slack.  

Beer options were surprisingly super limited (no local or craft beers offered), but I decided to give the Dirty Blonde house brew a try -- reminded me of Blue Moon -- served in a big ol' super frosty mug at 29 degrees. I must say it is really tasty with an orange wedge!  

We got the hand braided pretzel ($5) for an app -- served with warm beer cheese (made with the house beer Knotty Brunette) and grainy brown mustard.  Decent.  Greasy(?) but decent.

The food menu is not diverse, folks.  Healthy food eaters beware -- aside from 2 'loaded' salads (a cobb and one other), there were zero real options for a health nut.  Even the broccoli was listed as ""sauteed"" on the menu.  

I threw caution to the wind and for dinner I picked the fish tacos and subbed out the chips and salsa for the mac and cheese (topped with bacon).  The hubs got the Smokehouse Burger and fire fries.  While my fish had a good season on it, there just wasn't a whole lot of it, but there WAS a ton of the cabbage slaw on top.  The mac and cheese was just ok.  Hub's burger came with 2 patties even though he specified just one patty (it is an option for a few bucks less), so he took one patty off.  The patties appeared a little Mc-pre-formed and flat-top cooked -- not grilled.  Disappointing.  The fries were just regular thick cut frozen steak fries with some ""cajun"" seasoning on them.  Meh.    

Food aside, I do have 2 general gripes to share.  Uh oh... 
-- I feel that I need to advocate for the servers here when it comes to their uniform -- and no, not in the feminist ""women are being objectified at Twin Peaks"" kind of way.  What I mean is this -- it was almost 90 friggin degrees outside and you have these gals in thick knee socks and black Ugg boots?  Sure, the top 1/2 of their body gets plenty of ventilation, but seriously?  That footwear and sock combo? And as a former server I know that non-slip shoes in the kitchen were a must... what happened here, folks??  And is Ugg material even sanitary with food rehash and kitchen gunk on them?  Sorry -- just had to be said.

-- My biggest gripe of the whole deal is that they allow smoking on the covered patio while people dine and it is mere feet from the doors in to the restaurant.  There was a dirty ash tray on our table when we sat down and patrons from inside were stepping ""out"" around our table to smoke while we were trying to stomach a meal.  YUCK.  We even had to ask the young men at the table next to us to kindly turn off the fan mounted above their table as it was blowing their smoke directly at us.  UGH. This seriously put a damper on our meal and overall experience.

All in all, I would give our TP experience a one and a half star rating based on the pricey meh-esque food and the aforementioned gripe alone, but the beer was good and our server was really sweet.  I just don't see us rushing back to Twin Peaks for another $50 meal any time soon.  Perhaps to watch a game and have a beer, but not for the lackluster food.",2015-06-09 16:37:39

As an alum of the building across the street, I was perplexed at how such a massive building with so many parts would fit *right there*. Like, how would that work? As a result, I gave it some space for a while. Not that it did anything wrong. I just didn't understand the physics behind the construction. And then I ventured inside...

I don't know how they did it... I don't know what kind of witchcraft was involved but the powers that be managed to create a space that's light, airy and much more massive than I would imagine from the outside. This isn't Caviar & Bananas' first time at the rodeo -- and it shows. This is the perfect Midtown breakfast/lunch spot. With dedicated areas that fit whatever mood you're in, you're sure to find something to suit your needs. Want a gluten-free muffin? Do it. Need some frozen rose in your life? All the time! I mean, you can find that here. Feel like some bougie grocery shopping? Okay. Looking for some international candies? They have 'em. In the mood for a sandwich? They can do that.* Fancy a salad? Let's do that... and that's what I did. A very smiley and kind young woman walked me through the menu. She told me her favorite was the Baja, so I ordered that. I was planning on eating my salad there but she prepared it in a to go box. I don't know if that's standard (a set up like C&B seems that it should go hand in hand with cool plateware) but it happened. With the to go box in hand, I took the salad to go and made my way home.

The salad was delicious. The combo of romaine, cotija cheese, avocado, corn, tomato, cucumber, jicama, pickled onions, and pumpkin seeds was a nice, bright burst of health with every bite. I haven't had much jicama since leaving Miami so that was a nice plus and the pumpkin seeds added depth to what could have been a flat salad. I was particularly pleased with the sliced avocado on top of the salad because I love avocado and rarely get a full one in a salad. I asked for the chipotle lime vinaigrette 'on top' and the dressing came mixed into the salad so it was more of an element of the dish than a last minute addition. C&B is a pretty spot on fast casual ladies who lunch destination. If you would have mentioned the concept and location five years ago, I would have said you were crazy. After being there a couple of times, I don't know what took so long.

They were generous with the scoop sizes and overall, the hubby and I were happy.  I was a bit annoyed when the man helping us put a limit to the number of samples we tried between us to 3, when we ordered 4 scoops of ice cream.  It wasn't like we were not ordering each thing we tried.  I found this off putting as we were ordering scoops as we went.  I did not appreciate the attitude.
  
The hubby had the chocolate obsession and chocolate peanut butter in a cookie cone.  Both these flavors were very tasty, but the peanut butter stood out.  The cookie cone was not tasty.  It reminded me of that children's cereal, but much worse.  It was superbly hard and tasteless.

I had the red velvet cake and the birthday cake.  The red velvet was delicious.  I greatly enjoyed it.  The birthday cake was the 4th flavor that I was not allowed to try.  I liked it, but found it over sweet.  I still ate it all. 
We were filled with heavy cream and took off to walk it off.  

Overall, this is a good ice cream shop.  It is certainly not the best I have ever had.  The reviewers who felt this was the best ice cream they have ever had need to take a trip to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard during the summer.

However my last experience was the most atrocious experience I have ever had.  I understand that it was the first opening day and some hiccups are to be expected, but Friday is quite beyond.  First we arrived at our reservation time of 7:30.  Once we arrived we were told by the very disheveled matradee that they were running about 30 minutes late.  No issue so we took a walk around the block.  We arrived back at 8 and were told we were the 2nd table to be seated after 1 couple and they were cleaning 2 tables at that moment.  We sat on the bench at which point I watched him seat 2 couples.  Then another customer who showed up later than us went and said something and he sat them at a 4 top.  At that point I went back up and he looked at his computer and couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and looked confused.  He said I'll be the next couple and said here's a $25 gift card.  It was only $15 when I opened at home.  We waited another 15 minutes at which point a waiter started going to everyone including us to tell us they were out of food.  

There were multiple chances to tell us they would be out.  Instead we waited and waited, watched other people be seated when we were due to be next.  I rather write to you directly then putting my review on social sites as I think you should know about my full experience.  The waiter did give us a $50 gift card as he did with others for running out of food.    I emailed the restaurant direct with no response.  DONE",2020-06-16 13:38:27

Fast forward a few months and we ended up back at Bar One for brunch. It was around 12:30 when we got there and I believe their brunch is 11-2:30 Then the kitchen closes for an hour and they start dinner at 3:30 PM. My girlfriend got Eggs Benedict that she really enjoyed. I ended up getting the cheesesteak omelette with their special wiz sauce on top. I didn't ask how they made their sauce but I suspect it's a mixture of wiz cheese and heavy cream; it was to die for. The entire meal was phenomenal. Their menu is also very eccentric which, as a foodie, I really enjoy. 

The staff is very friendly and informative. They also have a lot of drink specials. If you love Bloody Mary's you'll love it there.

Service - 3/5

Host is friendly and the waiters are nice. Nothing extraordinary. The only thing I thought (and maybe it wasn't appropriate for me to expect?) was that there would be an introduction to the sushi sampler/omakase we ordered. I'm clearly not a sushi expert so I had no idea what I was eating, but I kind of wish I did. I guess I was used to an intro/story typically offered at other sushi places for an omakase.

Rittenhouse Roll, J&J, Omakase/Sushi Sampler & Fried Oysters 

The rolls were great. I enjoyed the Rittenhouse Sq Roll thoroughly and the J&J was good to taste. The fried oysters and sushi samplers weren't my favorite. The fried oysters were too sea watery for my taste, and the sushi samplers didn't feel too fresh to me.

They do take opentable reservations! However, when we got there, it wouldn't have been an issue to get a table - but we also went at 8 Pm on a Wednesday:) 

Starters:

Blood orange fluke - best part of the meal. The fluke was so gooood and went really well with the capers, blood orange, and radish pieces! I couldn't get enough! A must ORDER!! 

Rock shrimp: this was good as well!! I liked it because it wasn't coveredddd in sauce or heavily fried. It was the perfect balance of sauce and batter  - there was radish pieces as well - which I loved! Gave it a nice, refreshing crunch to your bite. 

Lobster rice - this was just your usual fried rice ... with lobster and mushrooms. Some at my table said it was too salty - I think it was the mushrooms - but the rice itself was decent. I'd order it if I wanted fried rice ‍

Soba noodles with shrimp - this was good too. My pick over the rice, actually. However, we had this after the rock shrimp and fluke - and those seemed to be the best! 

Sushi: 

Sushi was decent. But nothing heavenly delicious. I have yet to find a good sushi place in Philly  however, the starters were really good, which would make me want to go back and try the other dishes besides the sushi. Sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. But good place to go to take care of that sushi craving! 

The sushi that we tried....

J&J : this was the best out of the 3 we got. It tasted fresh and flavorful. It had a bit of a rich taste which made you feel full after 2! 
Broad street: this was okay. Too many ingredients made the sushi feel soggy and the flavors didn't seem to have .... flavor. Just wasn't a good combo, in my opinion.

One of the greatest bbqs I've had! All the meet was so juicy, tender, and flavorful.

We got the jerk rubbed chicken, ribs, and brisket and the ribs were my favorite with the chicken a close 2nd. 

They also had specials on a Saturday night! $5 wings and pork poutine fries, both of which were delicious. The wings were better than expected, very juicy and flavorful.

I wasn't told that a salad was coming and wasn't told even what came with the fish so I had to turn the salad away when it came. When the fish entree arrived it looked very, very small and it was overcooked. The waiter came about the time I was finished the overcooked fish and then asked if I wanted something else. No apologies, no discount on the ticket and certainly didn't express any concern. The waiter really didn't care what I thought about the meal! Very disappointing!

Salad toppings are extensive, and include all your standard veggies, cheeses, and lean proteins. There is also a pasta salad you can top your salad with.

Such is the case with Twin Peaks.  I was so impressed with the food and the service at lunch (Arielle was my server) that I had to come back! From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with friendly smiles and a courteous staff.  While the place was very busy, there was no long wait.  Almost immediately after I was seated, Arielle was there checking on what I'd like to drink and answering my specific questions about the menu.  While I've had people at other restaurants seem irritated when I ask questions, Arielle seemed eager to answer my questions and came across as very authentic and helpful.  Her service was over-the-top, too  (not once did I go lacking for anything), but two other things stood out in my mind as well.  While Twin Peaks is a sports-bar/restaurant, they're very family friendly.  That's unusual for many sports bars/restaurants I've visited. Singles, couples, families, and sports enthusiasts waiting to watch the games were all present. And I can't begin to describe how delicious the food was!  For lunch I had ""Mom's Pot Roast,"" but to be honest mom never made it this great.  My dessert was a Twin Peaks Sundae that was amazing.  For my return trip at dinner, I specifically asked if Arielle was available.  I was informed I was in luck.  She had worked a longer shift than usual today.  I wanted to eat lighter, so I had a cup of Blonde Bean with Bacon Soup (delicious!) and asked Arielle specific questions about the items on the dessert menu I still hadn't tried.  (Again, there was no impatience or indifference.  She was warm and friendly and seemed eager to assist me in making my decision.) I decided to go for the Mini Apple Turnovers with Ice Cream and Caramel Sauce.   They were fantastic, but for something with ""mini"" in the name, I wasn't expecting such a generous serving.  My whole experience (both visits) was fantastic!    As I'm scheduled to leave Indie in a few days (work trip), I regret I won't be able to try many of the other items on the menu until I get back into town.

We headed up to Publix to get something from the deli but when I saw that their deli no longer makes it fresh, he made a call to his mom and she recommended Cesarina. 

When we arrived, there was a line but OMG did this place smell good. I looked around while my cousin waited in line. The cases were loaded up with some sides, meats, sausages, desserts and olives. I thought I died and went to heaven. I even found some dried pasta that was hand made that I have not been able to find locally. 

I bought some of the potato salad, tortellini salad, two varieties of olives and some marinated artichoke hearts along with 2 bags of pasta to take home to Orlando with me.

It started with check-in and seating. When we arrived, the two hosts, clearly flustered and whom I felt badly for if I'm being honest as they were overwhelmed, were arguing with each other over a table that had been somehow mis-seated. They audibly (and in front of other guests) tried to work this issue out but meanwhile let other guests linger in the very small waiting area in the front without explanation. 

After checking-in at 8:10pm for our 8:15pm reservation, we were told our table wasn't yet ready and when we asked approximately how long the wait would be, we were told ""tables are just lingering, so please head to the bar."" Anyone who's worked in the Industry understands occasionally this happens after check drops, especially on weekends, however to my surprise upon walking in the dining room I observe multiple open tables/tables that need to be serviced and flipped. 

We are forced to sit at the bar (where the service was really less than stellar and/or quick) until 8:45pm and I'm convinced the only reason we got a table is because a member of our party kept continually checking in with the host to inquire about our reservation. 

Once seated (and starving), we received a brief apology from our server and he noted that this ""happens around the 8pm reservation time sometimes,"" so it seems like this seating delay is a common problem Green Pheasant is aware of. We immediately ordered some dishes because we were starving. Since the first two were raw foods, they were delivered to us fairly quickly. The rest took FOREVER. We were told the kitchen was very backed up and they'd come out as they were ready. To say this was frustrating after our wait to be seated was an understatement. 

I observed a manager on the restaurant floor in our area only once throughout the night. He never did a table touch to ask about or experience in general, or to apologize for the wait for the table or food delays. There was no good faith gesture of any sort or acknowledgement from the restaurant regarding our experience beyond the very brief apology from our server, who obviously doesn't control the kitchen volume. 

The food was decent but to be honest, I was so hungry by the time any food came out, I would have eaten just about anything. 

To summarize, I would never return to The Green Pheasant and am baffled by the positive reviews of this restaurant given what I experienced, observed, and discussed with fellow diners while at the restaurant. What an extremely disappointing (and pricey!) experience.",2019-02-16 22:20:09

Well, they definitely accomplished that.  We went for dinner on the recommendation of a friend.  It was a Friday evening and we didn't have reservations so I was prepared for a wait. I was shocked when the host said it would only be 10-15 minutes. My husband and I stood up front for a few minutes until another hostess asked us to wait at the bar ""at the end of the hall"". 

We strolled down the hallway past a good number of banquet rooms and finally found the bar through an old swinging door. We stood waiting for about 10 minutes and finally decided to have a glass of wine.  The wine list is mediocre at best.  My husband went to the bar to order and the bartender had no idea which wine on the list he requested.  The bartender's quote was ""all I know about wine is red or white"". A waiter finally showed him where the bottles were.  After another 15 minutes, we wandered back up front to check on our table.  The host remembered us and said we were next.  We were seated in a cavernous booth after about a 35 minute wait.  

Our waiter came over and seemed immediately disappointed that we already had drinks.  He walked away and came back 15 minutes later to take our orders. I requested a glass of water at that point.  We both ordered pasta entrees and salads.  I got my water pretty quickly and our entrees were close behind.  We then asked about our salads that we hadn't received.  The waiter appeared pretty embarrassed and proceeded to tell us that he was so busy he was sweating and that if we wanted drinks to order now because the table next to us had been waiting about 20 minutes for another round of beers.

The food itself was okay. It was filling and the portions were well-sized, but not something worth a trip back over to Alton. In fact if we are driving through again, I would go out of my way to choose another restaurant.",2015-01-05 21:15:28

We also shared the Milky Way dessert. I ordered the pick two option, which consisted of 1/2 fried shrimp po-boy and gumbo. 

The flatbread, brussel sprouts and dessert were off the chain! I highly recommend and would order again. The crust of the flatbread was crispy. The red sauce was perfect, not too sour and not too sweet, but jussst right. It was cheesy and the fresh tomatoes were on point. I love brussel sprouts done right and these did not disappoint. Firm and roasted in olive oil. Is that bacon I taste? I don't know, but I wanted seconds. The presentation of the Milky Way was too cute. It had chocolate fudge and blondie/brownie bites, popcorn and honey roasted peanuts, on rings of caramel. All surrounding a center of orange chocolate ice cream from the Creole Creamery. I don't remember the exact name of the ice cream, though. 

My fried shrimp po-boy was good. The bread was toasted and the shrimp were seasoned. The pepper jelly glaze was a nice touch. They applied it with restraint, so the flavor wasn't overpowering. I would opt for the full sandwich next time. The gumbo was earthy with a dark roux. It reminded me of the gumbo my high school served. It was missing the rice and grilled cheese sandwich like the high school version, though. The andouille was good, but they were a bit stingy with only one piece. I think the meat was mostly turkey, which left a lot to be desired. I would've preferred smoked sausage, shrimp or more andouille. Overall, it was a good meal.

The Ambiance: This is one lovely restaurant. I would use it as inspiration to redesign my family room. The colors--navy, copper orange, tan--furniture, fabrics and decor were all breathtaking. I felt at home. It was bright and airy. They also have a cute and sizable patio for outdoor dining.

Ardmore Pizza is not someplace I'd sit down and eat (there's no tables), but I'd get their take out. If the level of service we got in the shop was any indication, their delivery guys are probably awesome, too. The pizza we got was fresh and hot, with tons of cheese and a crispy crust. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but I could dig it. I'd be curious to try other types of pizza, since I had gotten the BBQ chicken, and thought that may have influenced the sweet flavor in the tomato sauce a bit.

Our server Rebecca was attentive and upbeat, happy to share personal recommendations and ensure our drinks were plentiful.
The menu is expansive and it was hard to choose, so I kept my paper copy to check off the things I had tried, and want to try. A nice detail were the notations indicating vegetarian, and gluten free options! 
We shared the bacon wrapped dates (slap yo momma!), tuna tartare and the sunflower seed salad (I really delighted in the toasty seeds and shaved cheese-not a salad I'd pick outright so it was a delight!)
For mains, we tried the truffle and thyme frittata and the small mushroom pasta with added lump crab. My runny egg was hard boiled but thankfully not over cooked and there was no way I'd be sending my dish back just for the egg. If they are sous vide poached eggs, I hope they recalibrate.
The wine was delicious and the variety of pour sizes was a nice option if you wanted to bounce around and try your palette out on several varietals.

Finally got around to visiting for brunch a few weeks ago and it did not disappoint. We were able to sit in their cute courtyard and enjoy the nice weather. All staff were masked and the tables were decently spaced out. 

The brunch options were most pleasing; it was a little hard to choose. We decided to start with the jump lump crab deviled eggs which were light and a great way to open the meal. The crab was fresh and it was a great twist on a classic favorite. For our meals, I settled on the Apple Fritter French Toast and my friend got the Cochon De Lait Benny. 

That french toast? *chef's kiss*. The bread was thick and held up really well against the caramelized fruit and syrup. The pecans offered a nice crunch that broke up some of the richness of the dish. If you're into more sweet/dessert-style brunch options, get this! I wish I could have eaten more but I didn't want to overstuff myself. The Benny was equally as delicious. I loved that their take on it with using a grit cake instead of an English muffin or biscuit. The pork was tender and flavorful and the greens were rather tasty for a restaurant. 

Our service was awesome! Our server, Justin, took really great care of us. If you're ever in his section, please show him some love!",2021-02-07 01:36:05

OK Maylie's (which closed in the 80s was kind of run down but it was still beautiful and that wisteria vine was gorgeous in the spring). Definitely a 5 star space especially considering the last incarnation that was here.

My review is for the brunch menu only. The menu was interesting and had some variety to it. The winner was the dutch baby pancake... that lemon curd was to die for. Even my friend who isn't into sweet breakfast was swayed. One friend had the crab cakes which she said were good but was raving about the duck fat potatoes underneath. The other friend had the couchon and grits. And I had the smoked salmon and egg. So here's the thing each of our dishes had a poached egg and none of the eggs were poached properly. All the yolks were set and for one of us the yolk was set but the white was somehow undercooked. It was weird. 

For my salmon dish, it was tasty and the salmon was well cooked and not overly salty, but the hollandaise (of which there was maybe a tablespoon) was only on the egg, when the salmon could have used the moisture. I think the dish could be excellent with a bit better plating and egg cookage. 

Our drinks were tasty (mimosas and an old fashioned). And they were offering a Veuve special which we did not participate in. One of my friends has been to their happy hour and said it was great but they don't have any information on that on their website. 

Service brings this above a 3 since our server was hustling especially after the restaurant filled up by midday. They've only been open since September so I hope they find their footing.",2019-01-14 22:20:43

The lady who helped me at the counter was very friendly. She informed me what pastries just came out fresh. (Their egg tarts are very popular by the way.)

Other times that I've come here, they've sold out on the pork scallion roll. I was so glad to see they actually had some when I stopped by!! Finally got to taste it and I was not disappointed. The bread is so soft and tasty. It has the light taste of pork and scallion. I honestly expected a little more scallion to be in it, but it still tasted delicious. For those not familiar with this kind of roll, forewarning to those who don't like mayonnaise: it has a mayonnaise-like spread inside. I personally think it enhances the roll.

I also tried their roast pork bun for the first time. Do not miss out on this if you like roast pork !! This is a great combination of sweet and salty. The bun itself has the sweet topping and it's filled with the roast pork inside. I regret not buying more than one, especially because it's so affordable. :(

We started with shishito peppers which turned out to be the best of what we had tonight. Good but not so great I would return just for that. We had the tuna tartar which had a decent flavor but was warm and chopped up so much that one would wonder if they were trying to hide that they were using poor quality tuna. Imagine room temperature cat food on top of warm rice cake. The whole thing did not work. 
Then to the entree. The steak was good but salty. The spicy crab pasta which is their signature dish came out cold and way after the steak. When we told the waiter it was cool, we were told it was because the noodle was rinsed and would never be piping hot. I'm sorry but a bit warmer than cold doesn't cut it. This was also very salty and I was told it was because I asked for spicy and they added chili sauce. Really?  The chef does not know how to make things spicier without making it so salty you can't eat?  So to save time and by this point my husband had already finished his steak so I asked for some plain hot noodles to be added. 
They brought some dumplings while waiting which was a nice touch but please don't bother ordering. They are less than tasty. 

Finally the noodles came out and they added garlic butter which made the plain pasta salty again. JAPANESE FOOD DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SALTY. 
By now we were ready to get out of this pretentious place. The bill came out and they had charged us 14 for the noodles. So they charged 26 for salty lukewarm entree that was not edible as it was, then charged 14 more for what I had hoped to be warm plain noodles. So basically we were asked to pay 40 for a mediocre dish. We complained and they took it off the bill but that should have never happened. 

My prediction is that the place would not survive if they do not improve the quality of their food. You cannot survive on looks and cool vibe alone.",2019-04-06 01:32:10

Our guest count was between 35-40 and we hit 42, which was not a problem at all with The Pearl. it worked perfectly as my husband and I got a table for two so we didn't have to pick where to sit!  the room was separate and very comfortable for our amount of guests. it was great for us- and the rest of the patrons- to have our own space.

1) The menu is insanely expensive. Our sandwiches were pretty basic and came with zero sides--on average, a sandwich costs $15. I should have just ordered off the kids menu which at least includes fries.

3) Service needs help. The waitress wasn't familiar with the menu and then messed up my order.

jPczuNCANenfWVaJHQnzeA,JlUFYRdIvbElmUqQX8wF8w,QdN72BWoyFypdGJhhI5r7g,2.0,0,0,1,"I've been on a search for a good, under $20, pasta option for a little while. Bar One isn't it.

     Let's start with what it is, though. Can you go have a beer with your friends, and watch a little of the game? Yes, you definitely can. Do they have a beer list which comparable to other crafty, Philly spots? Yes, definitely. Is it crazy expensive, or crazy crowded? Nope...it's ostensibly a neighborhood bar.

     By no stretch of the imagination is it an Italian restaurant. Frankly, I'm not sure why Bar One even bothers to pretend it is such...perhaps the neighborhood, or proximity to the market...but at any rate, fine Italian cuisine it is not. Excited to try a new spot, stopped in on a brisk Friday in November and, ordered the cavatelli with Gorgonzola sauce and sausage. The most notable issue was that there was no sausage. Strike one. I could not identify the flavor of Gorgonzola in the pale grey sauce either. Let it be know that I love blue cheese, and a little goes a long way with said ingredient; it's a strong flavor. This, however, tasted more like a bland rue. The pasta itself was stuck together in clumps, which made me wonder how it was prepared...pasta doesn't do that in a sauté pan.  It was thoroughly underwhelming. 

    It's also worth mentioning the staff...or at least one bartender.  My gent was fine. He seemed to have a little trouble getting around, but was courteous enough, and managed my order with no issues. There was another, much ruder, gent who spent the evening - or at least the time that I was there - trying to recruit customers into belittling the other bartender (the one serving me). ""Can you believe he has a degree in music?!?!...in MUSIC?"", he asked me with his absurd Thomas Shelby haircut and manicured beard. ""Who does that?!?"", he continued in his effort to impress himself. I absolutely did not take the bait; nor did most of the other customers, in what I can only expect was everyone trying to extend common kindness to a man just trying to do his job. 

     Let's have a reality check here. 1. Publicly belittling others lacks both character and professionalism. Full stop. 2. I have a degree in music, and what has been (so far, thanks be to God) a lasting & rewarding career in the Arts. So, what was meant only as unnecessary posturing between staff members, deeply offended your clientele. I chose not to engage the argument, because that is in no way what I'm looking for in a dinning experience...an argument with an arrogant, yet poorly-informed bartender. The phrase ""service industry"" springs to mind...SERVICE...since we like to repeat ourselves. In conclusion, the food was edible but not good; yet it was the utter pretension of Mr. Shelby which will ensure that I will neither spend another singular dollar, nor recommend Bar One to any of my friends or readers. #Service",2019-11-16 18:08:40

Around 6 PM on Thanksgiving Day driving down S. Virginia, we saw Macaroni Grill was open for business.  No wait and the restaurant was about 50% full.  Scored a table and ordered fried calamari, pizza, chicken marsala and several pastas.  Food was great but we did not receive the calamari appetizer.  Our waiter heard us mention this to another server and he jumped into action!  He found out another table was delivered the appetizer and they ate it!  By then, we were not as interested in the appetizer.  Our waiter took the appetizer off of our bill and then scored us two free desserts.  It was a cool gesture and really ended our dinner on an up note.   I had some hesitation in the past about going to a chain restaurant, but this really turned me around.",2019-12-20 16:40:09

Firstly, the server forgot to bring the soups out. I only got to ask where the soups were after she had placed the entrees down. She had mentioned to us that she was serving many tables. Maybe our server was in a bad mood or she was being overworked. However, my seating area was near the kitchen and I watched as servers either stood around or complained to each other. I got the vibe that no one working there wanted to be there or be bothered to give a good eating experience. 

Another example of the service was when I had asked the server if she could put my gift card code into the check. She said she would ask. After desert, when the check was given, she completely forgot to ask about the gift card. The matter was resolved but it does make me question if anyone working is paying attention. 

For the food, it was pretty tasty. The bread was good and I appreciated the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix. For an appetizer, we ordered the caprese salad which was the nice ratio of tomato to mozzarella. For my entrée I ordered the Cafe Milano which was also yummy. The ingredients such as the mushrooms tasted fresh and the chicken was well seasoned. The tiramisu was really good  and I'd come back here only to eat that. 

I want to mention that you are paying for the ambience of the establishment. The food is marked up by a lot which I would not mind if it weren't for the sub par service and atmosphere as mentioned earlier.

You pay for the time you spend in the cat lounge (up to 2 hours) and the price includes a coffee (or hot beverage). The cafe area is a large and inviting space you would hang out whether there were cats or not. There is a viewing window into the lounge so you can watch what's happening in the cat cafe and view the pics of the cats in the lounge before you go in. They also keep count of how many cats they have re-homed and they were up to 31 cats.

The owners were both there when I went in and they clearly have a passion for great coffee and rehoming cats! If coffee isn't your bag - they sell Cally's Teas and three spacial blends they made just for them.

The cat lounge itself is clean and well arranged with a few chairs and loads of nooks for snoozing cats, a castle climbing frame and loads of shelves for cats to climb and hide out. One cat, Homer, was particularly friendly and came out of a corner to strut around the room and get in on some of the action from cat lovers in the room. There is also a member of staff in there helping find cats and tell you a bit about them and their personality. It's really well organised. I'm looking forward to going back.",2018-01-31 05:10:13

Sake on tap is pretty cool and in my opinion a great drink to order before and with dinner here.  My date had forgotten her id....on her bday...and after she returned the bartender bought her a drink.  Didn't have to just did it out of kindness and made sure to get it to our table.  Thank you Mike!  The hostesses at the door kept us informed and were very polite when our table became ready.  Our seat was in one of the crushed velvet booths and was comfortable and could easily sit 4 just as comfortably to share all of our dishes with.  The food is served tapas style and arrives quickly to your table.  Our server was well informed about the menu and all employees were eager to share personal menu favorites as well as popular patron choices.  The okonomiyaki, spicy crab noodle and ikinari steak was our favorites out of the 4 plates we ordered and plenty for 2 people.  The fourth dish was the tebasaki gyoza not my style but was still very flavorful and with a crispy outer crunch.  I was surprised at the check expecting it to be more for a night out but was very affordable for a beginning of a fun date night!  We are excited to go back and try everything on the menu and I would love to come back for the lunch menu.  

A few tips:
1. Don't eat all day before you go,  you will want the extra room!
2. Everything is unique and delicious don't be afraid to explore!
3. The miso butter on the steak is very good,  we mixed it into the hot      plate with everything but next time might try it on the side for dipping.  It wasn't bad but I think we overpowered the other flavors with all the butter.

My ""go to"" dish is Shrimp Portofino: sautéed jumbo shrimp, capellini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, pine nuts, lemon butter  It is actually quite good and the bread that they serve is really good.  The service here is great - people are very friendly and they will keep loaves and loaves of bread coming if you ask.

I usually eat during the ""off hours"".  I eat dinner pretty early if it's going to be a large meal, so I have encountered the restaurant when there were a few patrons, but not when it was overly crowded.

Tip:  Regarding the Steak & Greens salad: 5 oz. sliced sirloin, baby kale, spinach, radicchio, arugula, crispy prosciutto, gorgonzola, crispy onions, balsamic herb dressing.  The balsamic herb dressing can be overbearing, I usually order it on the side.

I used the store credit to buy a shirt and some kids clothes so I wouldn't have to go back and I won't go back until they improve on their customer service and change the return policy.  

The return policy is and I quote, NO returns after 30 days, NO returns/exchanges without a receipt, NO CASH BACK, and you have to take the attitude that goes along with it all while the cashier updates their FB status.

So when my friends decided to go out for a pint before an event on Friday, Twin Peaks seemed like the best (and only) choice. I'm not a huge fan of ""titty restaurants"" like this to be honest because I hate that an establishment's theme is around women wearing revealing clothes as they wait on you. It seems rather sexist. But, that's just me being a prude. I'm also not a big sports bar person, as I find all of the TVs to be rather distracting for good conversation over dinner. But, Twin Peaks wasn't that terrible.

Our waitress was very friendly (and not just for the sake of garnering more tips). She legitimately seemed like a nice gal. She wasn't quite knowledgeable on all items on the menu though. Even if your serving at a place that's not a 5-star restaurant, you should still be able to recommend a few things off the menu if you can for the benefit of your customers. She also was a little slow to get to and from our table with our drinks, which I found odd since we were seated right by where the waitresses request drinks of their bartenders.

As for the drinks, VERY sweet. I ordered some kind of boozy lemonade off their drink specials menu, and it was mostly simple syrup/sour mix. Maybe this makes me a functional alcoholic, but I like to taste a little nip of the booze in my drink and not just sweet and sour. I had a taste of one of their house beers (all of which are themed with some kind of lumberjack name) and it was decent. Not anything to go out of your way for, but I could definitely tell this was more of a beer joint than a mixed drink place. Perhaps the bartenders are used to pouring more pints than mixing liquor drinks for all the men coming in to this watering hole.

The food was decent. Twin Peaks definitely redeemed itself in this area. I had some of the mozzarella bites to start, which were quite tasty -- lightly breaded and fried with molten cheese in the center...you can't go wrong with these. I also tried a few bites of the blackened fish tacos -- also very decent with a tangy chipotle mayo that came on them.

After our event, we ended up coming back to Twin peaks for another round and some of the gals came and chatted with us at our table. It was a nice distraction from all of the TVs that were vying for our attention in the place. I can't say that Twin Peaks will be my regular watering hole, but it is convenient, not terribly expensive, and they about the only interesting bar in the Castleton area with PLENTY of seating for a group.",2016-05-17 14:29:57

It is beautiful, tastes great, and is welcoming. BUT and this is a very big BUT for me. I understand that this business is new, and it's busy so I have given it some grace in that regard towards the issues I have concerns with but after happening to me on 7 different visits now I have to say I'm fairly dissapointed. 

Whomever is in charge of doing orders for Roast really needs to figure out how to order in abundance or order more than they normally do or whatever it may be. I have gone there on 7 different occasions to order different drinks each time and I am always told ""sorry we're out of this, or we're out of that"" Thus forcing me to order a drink I could get anywhere and was really less than thrilled about trying. Especially when it's a feature drink that you read on their FB page and decide yum! I'm going to go try it out and both times you visit during that special they are out of it. I once tried to get their Powered Chai literally 4 days in a row and they were out the entire time. Which was fine because I understood that they were new and the order had to come in and they gave me the option of trying their tea based chai. The time after that it was Pumpkin, the time after that it was the Apple Juice (out of Apple Juice?) 

I do love the atmosphere which is what keeps me going, and the drinks taste just fine, the desserts are delicious, and the service has been great, but the order issue is a serious bummer and definitely has me wanting to take the trip downtown for coffee meetings with clients less and less. 

Has the potential to be awesome though if they could get that glitch cleared up :)",2012-10-30 23:38:12

We didn't get our appetizers until 8:19pm. After waiting forty minutes for our appetizers we were finally able to order our entrees which also took forever. I don't remember when we ended up leaving but it was way too late and after 9:15pm and several of us were not satisfied with our meals and didn't even eat them but at that point we just wanted to get out of the restaurant and never return. 
Throughout our meal there was a lot of apologizing and blaming the kitchen and the chefs but with all of that blame I was surprised that a manager didn't come check to see if everyone was okay. That wouldn't have helped the experience because I won't go back but usually if there is that much wrong with the kitchen someone will come out and apologize or comp an appetizer or SOMETHING.

I ordered the squash salad as my main dish and my friend got the avo toast sans egg. She really enjoyed hers but it is difficult to mess up avo toast. I have heard from several people that that is their go-to at this place so I may try it one day.

My salad was so so salty. I can't even remember what the rest of it tasted like because I was overwhelmed by the salt. Not sure if they seasoned it too heavily or if the dressing was too heavily salted but I was disappointed as I couldn't taste the squash or squash blossom flavor, or anything else in the dressing. 

I wish that I'd ordered something else. Overall, I would come back for a pastry maybe but probably not a sit-down meal. They don't have a ton of options and they're all pretty expensive.

It is a sports bar  that had waitresses that are dressed in Specialty little outfits kind of like a checkered shirt with shorts on it kind of fit the outdoor theme of it it was very like Cabela's meets Hooters is the best way I can put it at Giant TVs everywhere the bathrooms were phenomenal they had like TVs right at each year and I really enjoyed that bathroom so huge! And I mean huge just when you thought that a bathroom couldn't be that large it is. It kept going on forever. But I really liked it was nice clean establishment they had my favorite beer on tap Oktoberfest by Sam Adams it's available August through October and the waitress Jasmine was excellent very nice sweet girl no complaints there I got chicken tenders and fries and a order the side of their Blazin sauce that is supposed to be extremely hot and it was hot I compared to like a blaze and saw set BW3's and I really like that Jasmine the waitress said that they were opening up Twin Peaks hopefully in Louisville soon which I would enjoy that because it was a cool place and if they had it in Louisville I would definitely go so I hope the owners are twin picture reading us and they are going to open one here that would be excellent for the five stars definitely want to go back definitely recommended good sports bar and look forward to going back,2017-09-03 20:07:59

The clientele was very relaxed and calm, but not touristy. Our server Cookie was really sweet and made us feel right at home. We ended up ordering a few things. My mom ordered the Peacemaker dressed but without bacon, and I ordered the classic fried shrimp po boy, dressed except for tomato, along with fries (regular and sweet potato) and onion rings.

Full disclosure, I arrived here with a full blown hangover (thank you Pat O'Brien's), and the po boy itself was enough to settle my stomach. The shrimp was crispy, and the crunchy bread and cool lettuce and pickle helped bring a little freshness and acidity to all the seafood. Fries, of course, were seasoned perfectly, and the onion rings, while the thin kind, were equally flavorful. 

Yes, the price point is more like what you'd find in say, Hoboken, NJ (close to where I live). But overall, I was really satisfied with the meal and thought this wasn't a bad choice for a po boy fix.",2020-02-02 19:09:38

Wine...
I had a glass of the house red and it was not very good, there are many inexpensive wines that taste decent but this was definitely not it. I ordered the Italian Chianti for my second glass.  

Food...
Ordered the Pollo Caprice and was disappointed. First it was salty, the mozzarella was salty, the arugula salad (was very very small portion, about 1/4) was salty & the grilled chicken breast was not only salty but rubbery, it was obviously cooked from frozen and had fake grill marks. Definitely not worth $17, go through any drive through for a better piece of chicken for 25% the price!

Service...
Was quick and friendly, I only have positive comments for the service. 

My wife and I use to love Macaroni Grill and I wondered why I've seen so many locations shutting down, I was in Reno and saw this location was open and decided to stop in for a nice meal but was disappointed and feel like I was ripped-off in the process, so now I understand why there're going out of business, and why I'll no longer be a patron.

C&B is a specialty market and cafe which started in Charleston, SC and I've not seen anything like it in my time in Nashville. The interior is immaculate from their perfect displays of pastries and sweets to pre-made salads and wines. Whether you are there to shop, eat or drink you will be impressed by the novelty of everything in C&B. 

The place--
It took me a few seconds to orient myself settling my eyes upon the different stations available to order food. Did I want a salad, a sandwich or to grab something to go? It was a bit much to take in at first then I appreciated all the choices. When I was waiting for my order I was thoroughly entertained. Although I got my order to-go since I work nearby I would think it would be fun to dine in as well. 

The food--
I ordered the Tennessee Trio sandwich ($10.50) which had porchetta, pork belly and bacon jam along with cheddar, pickled sunchokes and arugula on a ciabatta roll. The flavor was all there and it was a very filling sandwich. The porchetta was a bit too crispy for me and the sandwich was a little too rich for me to order it again but I did like it. I got a bag of Zapp's New Orleans Kettle Style voodoo chips ($1.95) and a small blueberry hibiscus iced tea ($2.60) to go with my sandwich and my total was $16.44 which is a bit steeper than I want to pay for a sandwich, drink and chips but for a splurge every now and again I suppose it's okay. The iced tea is not sweetened at all in spite of the blueberry I picture being slightly sweet naturally, this was not at all. If you want a little sweet I would suggest putting some sugar in before sitting down. 

The service--
My drink and sandwich took only a little bit to order. It can be a bit off-putting to have to go to two different counters to order but it didn't take much time. The front register for the barista will check you out if you get anything from one of the back counters. 

Overall, this is a place I'd meet a friend or perhaps treat myself for a nice lunch. Otherwise this is a bit too trendy/pricey for every day dining.",2018-04-02 16:04:28

Ice Cream:
This place had a pretty good selection of flavors to choose from, and from  what I've heard, they change flavors quite a lot (probably due to some seasonal flavors?). I taste-tested a few of the flavors, and got myself a double-scoop cone with Tennessee Fudge and Loaded Caramel.

First off, they give you HUGE scoops of ice cream. Usually, two scoops is a lot, but I didn't expect to get scoops that completely dwarfed the cone I was holding them in by so much. I was pleasantly surprised.

Second, when it came to the flavors I got, the Tennessee Fudge was amazing. I have no clue what they do with it, but that was some of the best ice cream I've ever had. The Loaded Caramel, meanwhile, was also very good; maybe on par or a little better than the Sea Salt Caramel that I've gotten at Salt and Straw.

I didn't get fancy with the cone I got; I just ordered a sugar cone. So, I don't think I can really review that part, but the main attraction would be the ice cream, itself, anyway.

Overall, it's some of the better ice cream I've had in quite a while.

Rating - 5/5


Service:
Not much I can really say here. The people who served us allowed us to try out the different flavors they had, and gave us our orders without much hassle. Basically, they acted in standard fare for a typical ice cream shop.

Rating - 5/5


Value for Money:
Perhaps this is slightly influenced by the prices I've seen in Seattle (where I currently live), but Mike's Ice Cream gives you quite a lot of ice cream for the amount you pay. Of note, for a double-scoop, I paid around $5, and got more than I usually would at places like Salt and Straw (which costed me way more for something similar). Furthermore, flavors like the Tennessee Fudge, alone, make the price worth it.

Rating - 5/5


Overall:
I've been to several ice cream shops in Nashville during my stay (places like Pied Piper Creamery, Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, etc). Of them all, Mike's ranks as my favorite. I'd definitely recommend checking it out while you're around Broadway.

We started with edemame, tuna tartar, tuna curdo and seared tuna salad. They were all amazing but my favorite was the tuna curdo which is basically thin slices of raw tuna in a delicious sauce. Order this app it's incredible.

Moving on to the rolls... We had the old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna and some yellowtail sashimi. Let me repeat the quality of fish they serve he is the best I have had period. All of these rolls were extremely tasty but my favorite was the peppered tuna! It comes with an amazing wasabi drizzle and the tuna is pepper crusted.

We also tried the Shumai starter (dumplings filled with lobster and shrimp and sitting in a ponzu sauce). They may have been my favorite dish of the night. Perfection. 

For our larger plates, my husband and I shared the ora king salmon and the spicy crab noodle. The salmon was outstanding.

The spicy crab noodles were absurdly delicious as well. We fought over every last bite.

It is right off of Poydras, and I had never noticed it.  We sat on the garden patio, which completely hides the fact that you are sitting on a street corner. Plants completely envelop this patio, and it is incredibly beautiful and pleasant.  

We visited during coolinary, so there was a special coolinary menu you could order off of if wanted (you could also order from the normal menu).  I chose the french onion soup, croque madame, and the dessert beignets.  Every single item was delicious and decadent.  The beignets were the best I've ever had - they are light, airy, and puffy on the inside instead of heavy like they are at Cafe Du Monde.

There is a clean bathroom ""suite"" right inside the door, with unisex enclosed bathrooms.  This is a little weird but works out fine.

Paid street parking in front or paid parking lots near the restaurant.  Bus Stop one block away.

I'll definitely be back!",2021-09-23 00:56:29

I had put it in the refrigerator immediately after coming home with it. The taro fulling of the cake was sour and tasted very odd. They must of used old taro or just completely messed up the order. I was and still am embarrassed and disappointed at the cake because we had 20 guest and we served bad cake at my moms birthday party.

They initially had us placed at separate tables, but the manager quickly rectified this for us. I had only been for dinner and the brunch menu had a lot of the same overlap of some items. 

The duck debris fries are a MUST GET. they were devoured immediately. The flatbreads are also a great choice! I wish I had stuck to getting some small plates as my entree because the crab Benedict just didn't really do it for me. There was no flavor/spice in the tomato-sherry Holland size and just was a really bland dish unfortunately.

This place has a huge indoor pirate ship structure that our 6 and 4 year old loved- they happily kept themselves occupied for a hour or two while we sat and relaxed and had some cocktails! We noticed a ton of play dates happening with other groups and will do this in the future with our friends!

There is a section with a foosball table and corn hole and another area for old Skool Nintendo games- a couple of the controllers were faulty but neat concept nonetheless- behind the pirate ship there are mini rock climbing walls that are perfectly kid sized- the irony is that we spent money at the Real Rock Wall next door only to have them go as high as the wall here!

Was able to sit at the bar due to a wait for tables but understandable. The bar is made out of pieces of wood that kinda scream Fixer Upper is on the DVR. The vibe of the place was urban and perfect for its location. For apps we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Tuna Crudo, Miso Soup and the Pork Gyoza. 

The Miso was $6 bucks, when I asked my companion was it $6 bucks worthy there was a reply of lacking flavor but the size was equivalent to 2 $3 bowls somewhere else. 
The Brussel Sprouts: Now I confess I hadn't had brussel sprouts since at least 12 and that pushing it but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try them roasted instead of boiled and I am now a fan. The sesame oil was perfect and they were charred just enough to elicit the flavor of the sprouts to be slightly sweet.
Tuna Crudo: My companions loved this dish and advised the truffle oil was slightly overwhelming but delectable.
Pork Gyoza: Always good and great with the left over truffle oil

The perk of sitting at the bar was watching the chefs make the rolls and trying to figure out which one was ours. There is a mirror above the bar and more than once did we find ourselves staring at what was going on. We ordered 4 rolls to share: Fishtown, Old City, J&J and the Real California. The J&J was my favorite the shishito pepper would kick in right at the end for a spicy finish. The Old City looked to be the most popular coming off the bar and it made sense - its a instagramable plate in its own right and has a good flavor combo. I initially ordered the Fishtown and depending on what piece of fish you got on top kinda determined if it worked in my opinion. We decided to try the Real California roll for fun and honestly I could have done without.

Overall I liked it and would try it again. I do wonder if they are going to rotate rolls to keep it fresh.",2018-02-04 22:28:03

I chose the bucatini matriciana and it was a beautiful melding of sweet, spicy and savory tastes..as authentic as it comes. In addition to the pasta, no one does artichokes better (a family recipe with specially-sourced artichokes), and the Supploni al Telefono (ostrich egg-sized fried risotto balls with fresh mozzarella) we're also a special treat.

Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad. Their menu is not as extensive compared to other places, but quality over quantity. 

Before you roll your eyes, their rendition of avocado toast was pretty unique and had a couple ingredients not normally added. The sourdough was toasted a bit too long, it was hard to knife through the charred edges. On top you have a delicious spread of Carpinteria organic avocados that held everything together. Slices of cucumber (could do without), a couple of sprouts (gross), and some feta (yummy) are included. For flavor, they add a sprinkle of pepper and sunflower seeds. I also got an egg for $2.

And pepperloin was as dry as sawdust even with garlic butter. I am done with this place never again. Only went cause I was reliving the old days asking myself it couldn't have changed that much....YES it can and has. This place has gone so far downhill it's not even funny. We ordered stuffed mushrooms which were good. I ordered a $35 pepperloin with white pasta and my husband ordered bacon artichoke white pasta.  Well folks it was disgusting!!!  With a capital D. The white pasta tastes like pasta and if my husband didn't have bacon in his it would have had no taste what so ever. I got the 12 oz pepperloin medium with garlic butter. When I got this $35 steak it was well done no garlic butter and no peppercorns. So I cut into it two times thinking maybe I am missing the pink somewhere... nope well done and the edges were saw dust. Sent it back the waitress brings back the same steak smothered in butter.  R u kidding me!!  How do u make a $35 well done steak go back to medium with butter??  They r ignorant and the food is worse  save your money and go to Max's time out.

The patio was to die for; I didn't know if i wanted to sit inside, at the bar, on the patio or on the balcony (yes balcony!). Our server Justin was amazing. From the first introduction we fell in love with their personality. Great service really makes a good place a great one. Antonio also helped us towards the end of our visit.

We got bottomless mimosas and I swear we never saw the bottom of our glasses.... That was a first! Most places make you buy a bottle and call it ""bottomless"" or give you a glass or two but here you will keep getting that champagne refill until you LEAVE.

Apps:
- Jumbo lump crab deviled eggs
- Black truffle fries
- Filet mignonette brochette (Our FAV! The mushrooms were the best part... seasoned & cooked to perfection wow)
- Pork belly & corn fried oysters (least favorite but it was not bad. I would just recommend the other apps if it's your first time)

Entrees:
- Jump lump crab Benny (our server Justin recommended this for me! I added steak on the side also) 

Cocktails:
- Bottomless mimosas (we had orange juice, cranberry, & pineapple juice. All yummy but the pineapple juice was an all around fav because of how fresh it tasted) 

- Everything's Coming Up Roses: I usually stray away from floral drinks because it's too overwhelming or not blended well but I surprisingly enjoyed this mix. Told Justin to send my compliments to the bartender fr ahah!

I didn't know how the dolsot bibimbap was made without the stone bowl, which usually cooks the rice while your eating, so you can a nice crust around your rice towards the end of your meal. Basically the dolsot bibimbap to go was mimicking that experience with frying the ingredients before serving. At first, I thought the portion size was a bit small, but after eating it, I was surprised how filling it was. The gochujang or hot sauce was mixed in. The food was cooked well and it tasted great. It had a good amount of spice.

The only compaint I had about this place was that it's a bit pricey for my specific order. It was close to $14 for a relatively small rice dish. Maybe next time I may order a dish without the dolsot ($1) and beef ($3) upgrade and see how it is. The vegetable bibimbap seems decently priced at $8.95.",2021-11-23 08:17:09

It was in a paper cup. The biscuit with jam was also disappointing. Generously portioned, it was quite dense and moist but the blueberry and strawberry jam was very bitter, so much so that I needed to get up from my table (because server was so busy) and ask for honey at the counter to sweeten it up a bit.  The cashier gave me a tiny bit of honey, sparingly. Then, you are asked to bus your own table. That's also fine; but don't ask for a 15% or more tip when paying at the counter via the machine.

The real treat was being able to dine in and experience the food fresh out of the kitchen, at the perfect temp. Salads were crisp and fresh, well dressed. Caesar dressing is house made and perfect. Homemade bread is a bit dense for my liking, but I don't like bread all that much. Signature artichoke app was on point, and the sauce/dressing was out of this world. Clams in white wine sauce were on the smaller side, but i would've drank the juice if no one was watching. Branzino special was perfectly cooked and super tasty. But the absolute best was the gnocchi gorgonzola. They make it in house daily. They were fluffy pillowy dumplings. Like everything that you want a gnocchi to be, and rarely is. The cream sauce was buttery and cheesy without being heavy (but that could've been the case because I was already levitating from the taste and texture of the gnocchi itself?). The decor was warm and melodic Italian music played softly. Luigi, the owner and native Italian, visited our table after every dish was served to check on us. He was lovely. Two of his sons joined him and it was nice to see them enjoy a meal, and also to see what they ordered for themselves. Espresso after dinner was perfect, and two small pours of sambuca on the house were the perfect ending. The food was moderately priced but the quality and service were extremely high.

I'm not sure to whom I am applauding--their interior designers, the servers, the chefs, but everyone gets a big high five. This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Nashville. The meal was exceptional from start to finish. 

The service--
We had made a reservation on Resy through their website and we were seated promptly on-time. When we were seated we were brought warm towels to wipe our hands. Our server greeted us and was very accommodating. She was the best! 

The ambiance--
There was a slight Asian flavor to the decor but everything was very modern. Some of the seating had plush booths and some were tables. There was a center bar for people who just came to get drinks. The restrooms were very clean and to our amusement and delight they had  Japanese toilets which had a seat warming feature. 

The food--
Their menu consists of a cold section and a hot section. There aren't appetizers but the menu is mostly small plates and then towards the bottom of the menu the plates get larger. Our server went into the most detail of the menu of any server that I've ever had. It was great. She highlighted her favorite dishes but gave an explanation of how the dishes were prepared so we knew what to expect. We ordered: 
-Spicy crab noodles: buttered noodles with crab meat. My favorite, but apparently also most people's favorite since our server has said that every table will likely have one order of these. 
-Tebasaki gyoza: This dish blew my mind. Instead of the chicken stuffed into a traditional gyoza dumpling, the gyoza is stuffed into the chicken wing. It is deboned except for the end of the wing so you are getting a crispy chicken with the filling of the gyoza in the center. 
-Kinoko: These were different kinds of mushroom with Parmesan. They had such a great earthy flavor and a light broth.
-Broccolini with corn bread and rock shrimp: This dish seemed like an interesting pairing but everything worked together. The sauce for the broccolini was delicious and the rock shrimp had a different seasoning which worked together
-Wedges: This was the one dish I could have done without, but it was still good. The salad was served on skewers with dressing and shaved carrots.

Very understaffed, probably because of Covid so I get it. Everything looked so delicious I couldn't decide. To help me decide I asked if the ham and cheese sandwich came with the cheese melted. The 17 year old surfer at the register said ""yes"". So I chose it over the pastrami. When I receive it, cheese is definitely not melted. I ask the food runner to run it back to melt the cheese real quick, I don't want to pay $15 for ham and a slice of Swiss. I want a restaurant caliber sandwich. He comes back and tells me , ""we can't melt the cheese"". My husband has, in front of him, a pastrami sandwich with MELTED CHEESE. I take the sandwich up front myself and I ask the manager to just stick the silly sandwich under the broiler for me. No biggie. She says she can't. So I tell her I was specifically informed that it would be melted and now I don't want it. Very nicely. She gives me a blank stare. So I ask her to give me a pastrami sandwich instead. Which she does. My mother in law also ordered the ham sandwich, neither of us got the cornichons that are advertised. 
The thing is, as a cook, I know how easy it is to broil a sandwich. 
So. Excellent bread, terrible ham sandwich without anything to make it worth the $$. Beautiful menu. Don't order the ham sandwich. Nice staff who don't care at all, (no water in the jug though we asked twice), and the staff need to be trained on the menu they're selling. Everything is tasty but for that price they should know how to BROIL SOME CHEESE. So now the manager will go home and complain to her partner about the crazy lady who sent back a sandwich because the cheese wasn't melted. Ok. For $15 I get to, (as long as I'm nice) insist on what was advertised. Deal.",2021-09-12 01:22:25

The whole experience was sort of a let down.... While the online ordering process was easy enough, when I arrived there was no marking or indication of where I needed to go to do my pickup and the whole process of waiting and paying for my pickup took over 10 minutes (I showed up a few minutes after their website said my order would of been ready). 

The food was also disappointing. I had ordered a pasta with creamy Alfredo Sauce and there was NO sauce on my dish at all - just oily noodles; which was a shame because the noddles and veggies were cooked well and I was thrilled with their create your own pasta idea! Moreover, the Caesar Salad was suppose to come with crotons and there was no crotons - a small thing, but the salad I got was a pile of lettuce with a weird tasting - super thick cream sauce, it was rather off-putting.  

I think that they need to work on their customer service and perfecting fine details e.g. getting orders correct - I would of been far less disappointed if my pasta would of had sauce on it!

The service was good. A little slow but we weren't in a rush so it worked for us.

We came during happy hour and got two spicy tuna rolls and two spicy salmon rolls (which are $5 each at happy hour prices). It took a while for them to come out. I actually thought she forgot about them. They were just ok. 

My friend got the edamame which she enjoyed. I got a ginger salad. It said it had avocado so I assumed they were just trying to be different by calling it a ginger salad instead of an avocado salad. Most sushi restaurants that I go to have an avocado salad on the menu with ginger dressing and it has at least a half of an avocado on top. This salad came out almost immediately after I ordered it and it was super cold which makes me feel like it's one of those restaurants that pre-makes salads and keeps them in a fridge or cooler. The avocado was so sparse I barely even knew it was in there. Not what I'm used to! To be fair, I assumed it was the avocado salad that I get at other sushi restaurants. 

We split the lobster fried rice because so many people raves about it in the reviews. It was decent. Not amazing. It was kind of egg-y; I felt like that was the dominant flavor. 

The other special rolls I ordered are pretty forgettable. One was a KJ, I believe. That's all I really remember. I don't remember what the other one was even called or what was in either of them. What's not forgettable is the price point of these unforgettable rolls. Their special rolls cost $15 to $21 per roll. ($21? Seriously?) They were falling apart as we tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. The wasabi was more mild than I'm used to. 

The bathrooms are individual rooms for one person at a time. There was different music playing in the bathroom and it felt like a dance party. I was jamming out in there. Lol. 

There is kiosk parking located nearby. Just a short walk will get you there. I'm not sure of any lots. 

This place is great for the atmosphere but I've had wayyyyyy better sushi at a way lower price point. I feel like you are paying for the location more than anything. While I loved the ambiance, I don't really know that it would be worth returning to. I have sushi so infrequently that if I'm in the mood for it, I would rather go somewhere with better sushi and maybe not as awesome of an environment than mediocre, overpriced sushi in a modern, breezy location.

We sat at the bar, i scoured the taps, local stuff new to me. Great. Wine list, i was told was good too. 

A few drinks, food time. I went mud bug almondine, an app. After convincing, with google help, a poboy was a sub, hoagie, torpedo...the better half went chicken poboy.

The food.. I ordered the Philly cheese steak. That's always my go to sandwich to get. The seasoning on the need was amazing. The sandwich was full of mushroom onions and cheese. Best Philly I have had! And their on tap beer is ice cold. Coldest beer I have ever been served.

Atmosphere... It was very lumberjacky. When you pull in onto a horrible busted up parking lot and look at a lovely log cabin style building you are wondering why they dont fix parking lot.

The second disappointment was at the hostess stand. After standing there and being ignored for several minutes I believe it was a busser who came up to help. Being as we did not have reservations, he shook his head and tried to survey the restaurant. When asked what he was doing he replied trying to space tables and account for being short staffed, and then announced a 45 minute wait. No thanks. We all know how hard it is to run a restaurant in normal times and now it's harder. This ship needs a captain to run it efficiently or it will sink. Why would you not have the bar and the outside tables open? Obviously you needed space and to run efficiently.  Why book all available tables, you need to satisfy all customers.

The breakfast sandwich on brioche is pretty big! I really like the flavors, my one complaint is the egg patty is pretty thick and sometimes that's all I would taste.

Yesterday took a friend and her children to Tony's after apple picking.  When we arrived we were told our wait would be 20 min.  At 30 min I asked how much longer.  We were finally taken to our table 45 min after we arrived.

While waiting for our table in the small entry way, we noticed multiple occasions where the hostess desk was left unattended for 5-10 min at a time.  During these times the small entry area filled up with patrons waiting to be welcomed.

When we finally reached our table our waiter came by within a few minutes, took our drink order (all water) and 10 min later they arrived.  At that point the waiter left our table to take care of other tables.  In his absence another wait person came by and told us about the evenings specials and said our waiter would be with us soon that he was running behind. Another 5-10 mins later the second wait person returned and said they would be taking care of our table.  They took our order and after it was requested, brought bread.

We ordered an appetizer of Fried Artichoke Hearts.  Rather than receiving the entire heart, we received overly fried artichoke heart quarters.  Pathetic....not nearly worth the $8 we were charged.

When the food arrived it was disappointing.  The kids food was acceptable.  They had a burger and salad.  My friend had the Teriaki Chicken Kabob and I had the Garlic Chicken.  When my friends dish arrived all that was on the plate was the kabob....no side, no garnish, no nothing.  Definitely not restaurant quality presentation. She commented the taste was ok, but nothing special or worth the long wait.  My garlic chicken was advertised as being pungent, which to my mind meant you'd really taste the garlic.  Not so.  A tasteless, almost overflowing amount of chicken and pasta was served in a bowl that was too small for the portion.  The dish was supposed to have onions, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, chicken and garlic over linguine pasta.  I got lots of pasta, plenty of mushrooms, scarce amounts of onions, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  There was some garlic  but not anywhere near pungent. They also served a slice of garlic bread that was so hard it was inedible.  I was totally disappointed in this meal.

Due to the extremely long wait time for a table, the mediocre service, the poor food quality and the general lack of hospitality I will not be returning to Tony's.  I can't speak for my friend, but as this was her first experience I doubt she'll be returning in the future.",2014-10-19 22:11:13

Southern Fried Chicken on brioche (sandwich): this fried chicken sandwich was one of the most unique ones I have ever eaten, if only it was executed properly.. 
The good: brioche (golden and good crumb, grilled so it was toasty); jalapeño jam (sweet with a nice kick); black pepper bacon (peppery as advertised and extremely crispy)
The ""bad"": the chicken was incredibly crunchy and chicken well seasoned, but unfortunately a bit dry and burnt on some ends. 

I'd still recommend the chicken sandwich but I'd hope this was just an off day and that they don't aways serve burnt fried chicken because all of the other components of the sandwich were fantastic. Another gripe I have is that I ordered 3 spicy versions of the sandwich and none of them were spicy. Didn't go back because we were already on the freeway.

The biggest disappointment for BAP is the food, which is tragic. I love Korean food, and I fancy Bibimbap and korean pancakes. However, both versions at BAP were just a few notes short. The pancakes were dry and thick and fairly bland. The bibimbap, granted we got the regular version (non hot pot), was served almost at cool-room temperature without any close attention to how the flavors and texture coexisted with each other. The Japchae (noodle) was the greatest disappointment as it was served with a larger and too generous portion of white rice without any other sustenance. 

Objectively, the food was underwhelming, but if you take in the whole picture, the small and unassuming quaint place settings, you'd have a good time.

This place only serves bibimbap, pajeon, a soup, and japchae. Truly bare bones menu, with no banchan (side dishes) served. Additionally, there's limited seating -- maybe like 15 people tops? 

But what they make, they make well and cheaply! My stone bowl beef bibimbap set me back ~$8-9, and it was delicious. 

This bibimbap is a little different from others in that the spicy red sauce that usually comes on the side is actually premixed in stone bowl bibimbap. This means it's a little spicier than normal bibimbap. The regular (non stone bowl) bibimbap has plain rice. 

Overall, I'm pleased with the service (the elderly couple that run this place seem so cute!) and I'll be back again. Credit cards are accepted.",2018-03-19 23:48:17

Additionally, the greenery is so well kept and is likely to make guests feel extremely comfortable.

APPS: We got three types of appetizers: the truffle fries, the fig and goat cheese flatbread, and the Brussel sprouts. The truffle fries were so fluffy and light, they were eloquent and tasteful. I could have done without the flatbread. The goat cheese and the fig created a strange texture. I did not personally taste the Brussel sprouts but I heard that ""THESE ARE THE BOMB""

ENTREE: For my entree I got the LA Crawfish grilled cheese with the fries. The grilled cheese did not disappoint. It was super creamy and the remoulade was very smooth.

Located at the heart of Old City near the pier, Tuna Bar is a great upscale Japanese restaurant, perfect for dates. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The place itself looks very classy and modern. Their menu have a large selection, prices are a bit on the higher end but you are getting fresh, qualify fish. Not only is the food delicious but  the presentation is also just as nice. I loved that the rolls comes in a wooden tray. Also they have pretty good green tea that they serve in a steeping pot. Be prepared to spend a good lump sum while you're here.

*LUNCH*
- Tuna Tartare - Fresh tuna and avocado. I love the rick crackers that they serve this dish with

- Gyoza - pretty standard gyoza, though the skin was not as fried and crispy as I've had at other places.

- Broad Street - Salmon is my favorite fish and this roll literally was all I could ever ask for. The salmon was so fresh and the the sauce made the roll. No need for soy sauce or wasabi or any other additional, good as is.

Yes, I would definitely come back again",2021-06-09 00:54:02

There are some board games and cat puzzles if you'd like to spend your time doing something other than petting cats - Say what?

The owners, Nicole and Mike, are absolutely lovely.  Mike has a real passion for the purrfect cup of coffee and Nicole is a cat queen!  They fell in love with the concept of cat cafes when visiting Seattle a few years ago and have been on a mission since to open the purrfect Cat Café! 

Kids need to be 7 to come here - always good to call ahead and double check the current policy though in case there are any changes. 

And if you're looking for the purrfect gift for that special feline in your life, Paws has you covered from funky bow tie collars to cat wine, they've got it all!

All the treats and beverages here are locally sourced - Support local!

The only way to improve would be a larger location.  The cat room itself is quite small in comparison to other cat cafes in town but otherwise this place is MeOw-A-riffic!

Also, while you are here be sure to draw a cat or leave a purrfect note on their chalkboard wall - YES!

I got the beef bibimbop and was disappointed at the quantity and the quality. I got take out and the portion was small. The ingredients didn't even fill to the brim and they even skimped on the rice. 

The dish just tasted ""too homemade"" to me but NOT homemade in a good way. It tasted ""homemade"" like it was made by a cook that had only okay culinary skills (not homemade like your grandma's cooking). It lacked flavor and presentation. The rice was too sticky. The veggies looked limpy and tasted boring (blocky stir-fried cucumbers pieces, carrots not meticulously julienned, spinach just boiled but not seasoned). The beef pieces weren't even restaurant quality, not tender at all. The gochujang was the same stuff you can buy from the Korean super market with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I could probably make the same at home fairly easily using only oil, salt, and sesame seeds as seasoning and no advanced marinades, special sauces, or knife skills.

It didn't taste terrible, but it was underwhelming compared to bibimbop I've had at other Korean restaurants. I don't know about you but I eat out to experience dishes I cannot recreate (or would take significant effort to recreate) at home. For what you get, they should just charge $6 for a plain boxed lunch, not $10!

The cinnamon iced tea is also nothing to rave about. It just tastes like weak homemade generic green tea with cinnamon dumped in. The cinnamon doesn't even compliment the tea! $3 a bottle, too! In case you were wondering, unsweetened. Unsweetened cinnamon tastes disgusting/pointless, at least sweeten your damn tea.

I feel like this place is trying too hard to have that specialty/gourmet mom-and-pop feel, marketed towards boogie hipster patrons but the quality/creativity is just not there. I feel super ripped off!

Don't come here because it ""looks cute"" or because you like ""hole in the wall"" restaurants. Usually hole in the wall restaurants serve brilliant food but this one is not one of them. 

P.S. I put a photo of the food on my Facebook (like I always do with restaurant foods) and my foodie Korean friend said ""This is from BAP? Oh man ouch..."" I feel ashamed. For once no one was jealous of my food pic because it didn't look that good.",2016-12-07 21:27:52

This place was her suggestion a favorite for her but I think she was upset by the experience we did not ask for the manger because we did want to argue  or complain we just wanted to enjoy a meal and catch up and she technically did her job just poorly. I give it two stars because the food was pretty good the service no thank you!!,2016-03-25 13:44:02

The signature drink is a sesame latte, my wife ordered it and at first the flavor was strange. Adding sugar is necessary because the sesame flavor is bitter. We expected this drink to be unique, but would not order it again.

We also ordered an almond croissant that ""looked"" delicious, but was as hard as a brick and we had to throw it in the trash it made a loud thud noise. The barista was rude, I asked her if the baked goods were made in house, she smugly responded, "" I don't bake the items, but a baker does.""

Walk over to Rebar Coffee and Kitchen across the street, order a side of their house made (amazing) sausage patty, then head over to Helena Avenue Bakery and order the Egg & Cheese Biscuit Sandwich. Once you get your sandwich, pry it open, careful not to mess up it's yummy contents and place your Rebar sausage patty inside. Re-wrap and voila!...You have an incredible gourmet, adult take on a childhood favorite! 

I also highly recommend any of their quiches. The crust is legendary! 

Great customer service. Order at the counter and wait for them to call your name or number. Self-serve water, napkins and utensils. Plenty of seating amongst the long farm-style tables and chairs.

I'm really happy to witness the evolution of Helena Avenue Bakery. It started out small, with a very limited menu. Now it is bustling! I love the addition of the glass wall giving eyes to the exhibition bakery. I am excited to try their fresh baked loaves and rolls. It's great to have a local bakery so close to home!",2017-04-22 15:12:34

Read the reviews before dining and thought it'll be worth the experience. Completely wrong. 

Server was somewhat knowledgeable when asking him questions about the food but my boyfriend and I pretty much answered our own questions. 

Cleanliness- the menus were all paper and it looked very unprofessional due to all the wrinkles and sauce spill. The wine glass were very dusty. The spoon for our fried rice had a hair/fuzzy on it.

Food- Sad to say, the lobster fried rice was the best part of our dinner. The wagyu beef and west coast uni was good and kinda what we expected. The king salmon ($9) and otoro ($16) was such a disappointment. Both did not taste like the fish we wanted. The quality and presentation didn't match up to what we wanted. We eat sushi very often so we know what it look like and should taste like. That was not worth the money at all. We also had the chicken and shrimp dumplings, it was okay, very strong shrimp taste. But wasn't hot when it came out. 

Price- Too expensive for bad quality fish.",2018-04-21 02:49:57

We remembered a recommendation for Copper Vine, so we walked over. The renovations done to the building after the former beer bar closed are astonishing. The patio with amble seating and vines is like a little oasis in the busy area of the city. The dining area is open and well lit with airy space and windows. There are long dining tables and two seaters available. We simply sat at the bar where we had the most delightful server tend to us. He was friendly and engaging, and that just added to the experience. We ordered wine and two shareables - the filet mignon brochette and the fig and goat cheese flatbread. Wow, from the delicious wines to the mouth watering snacks, we were so pleased with our experience.

Little Italy

I shall now make a list of things that the Macaroni Grill is:
A good place to wait too long to be seated
A place with friendly wait staff once seated
A place that offers good food albeit overpriced 
Boring and a prime example of what happens when a restaurant stops trying

We went to the Macaroni Grill about two weeks ago for lunch.  I hadn't been there for the better part of a decade.  The place was vacant.  Maybe 4 other tables were full.  We stood at the podium for a good three for four minutes before we were even greeted.  

Once greeted we were sat quickly and orders were taken.  The food was very good (especially the deep fried macaroni balls and the fry appetizer).  Drinks were never empty and our waiter never let us get to low on bread.  

They really are way too expensive now for what they are and that's the deal breaker.  When the Macaroni Grill first opened they offered something that Reno didn't have.  Reno has grown and new restaurants have far surpassed this chain.  They really need to either lower prices or close up shop.

I won't go back.  It was my last visit.  If I'm craving expensive Italian, I will go to a multitude of places that now call Reno home.  If I'm craving less than expensive Italian, I will go to The Olive Garden and bring my own crayons and paper for the table.",2016-07-07 20:25:26

All three were outstanding, but would give slightly lower marks to the salted caramel (usually my fave) as the flavor just didn't seem to pop as much as the other two.

Reading the reviews I was excited to try it. As the reviews mention the egg is perfectly soft. What I found lacking was any flavor. The brioche bread was not as buttery or sweet as others I have had and I was just expecting more.

Chicken sandwich: 4/5
After taking my first bite I was underwhelmed but realized what the problem was. The bacon is too chewy and distracts from the perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside chicken. So I removed the bacon and took my second bite and loved the sandwich. I would order the chicken sandwich with the bacon on the side. I wish the bacon pieces were thinner and crispier.",2022-01-06 05:20:14

You order at the counter (usually after waiting in a line out the door), and their servers bring the food out to your table. Even though the sandwiches look small, they're pretty filling, and the baked egg block is fluffy. The green eggs and ham on brioche is my go-to; it doesn't taste like any old breakfast sandwich because of that delicious green harissa! I didn't like the farmer's market sandwich on brioche because it was really soggy, perhaps from the Swiss chard. 

For a sweeter option, the Elvis is my favorite hefty, rich treat. Who knew that banana bread, peanut butter, bacon, and honey would go so well together? Their baked goods in the display case are also very tempting. The brown butter pecan cookie is pure bliss.

I ordered the mamas trio, chicken parmesan, lasagna bolognese, fettuccine alfredo.

Just because you're taking an order to be delivered don't assume that the place has a table etc, especially if you ask on your menu if we needed utensils, and bread to be included with the order. We also asked for extra alfredo sauce and red sauce. Who made this order??? 
For $35 plus delivery fee and tip. Reallyyy and all smashed together, your cooks and you don't care obviously about people who are not dinning in. Did it ever occur to you maybe someone just got out of the hospital and wanted, what they thought would be a good meal after eating hardly nothing in the hospital and we picked you out of many many restaurants to order from!! We were very wrong. Your cook and food preparer just put the food in like it was a trash can and mixed everything together to save you plastic containerd & to go ware.

I love the atmosphere and decor of Copper Vine. It's much bigger than what it initially looks like outside, but I'm learning during my NOLA visit that there are multiple restaurants that have levels to them. Pretty cool!

We ordered the margherita flatbread and it was not that impressive. It had a good crunch to it but looked dismal. Unlimited mimosas here for like $25. 

I ordered the quiche with crab and it was really tasty - I wish it was bigger!!! The arugula salad on the side was so fresh too. 

The gnocchi was probably the best serving I've ever had - usually it's pretty soggy and hard to get through but this had such good flavor and texture.

The first time, we were very impressed by the quality of the fish and the preparation of our food. The second time, the quality was still very good but it wasn't prepared as well as the first time we visited. Since this restaurant is fairly expensive, we were slightly disappointed. 

The food we ordered included miso soup, tuna tartare, Old City Roll, Fishtown roll, White Tuna Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll. We really enjoyed the tuna tartare and the Old City Roll, although the rock shrimp on Old City Roll were not cooked as tender as the first time we went. The fish in the other rolls was very good quality, but we were not too impressed by the overall rolls themselves. 

Most recently we were here on a Thursday and there was supposedly a happy hour on the lychee martini that featured the drink for $5. We were told when we sat down around 7pm that the happy hour was still going on and we could order the martini with the discounted price, which we did. The martini was delicious, however, when we went to pay the bill, our drinks were listed as full price and the same waitress we had since he beginning of the meal told us that we ordered after the happy hour was over.

All of the bread and desserts are baked onsite via Lost Bread Co. The menu features a lot of great snacks and sandwiches, though not many healthy options. I've tried the cheese curds, wings, fries and italian market panini. All were absolutely delicious!  

The beverages menu offers a lot to drinkers but not much for non-drinkers. I've personally tried their ginger beer, which is on tap (it's great!) and virgin bloody marys (their mix is made in-house and it's delicious!). I'd really love to see some creative NA cocktails, though! For the drinkers, there's a ton of beer, plus some wines, hard seltzers and cocktails. Only a few of the cocktails are made with local spirits (shout out to Philadelphia Distilling and Manatawny Still Works) and it would be cool to see more Philly representation on that list. 

For someone like me, aka, not a kid person, Craft Hall is kind of a hard sell. This place was without a doubt made for families. It's truly a genius concept! On my two visits (so far), there were multiple children's birthday parties. That said, the space is so large that even adults-only groups can likely find some kid-free space near the front bar.

We ordered dumplings, edamame, lobster fried rice, shrimp tempura sushi, and bone-in steak. The dumplings were good, but not as flavorful as the best dumplings I've tasted. The lobster fried rice was the standout. It's a large delicious bowl, with enough lobster to actually taste, and you have plenty to take home at the end. The steak was a perfectly cooked and juicy medium. But it was a fatty piece of steak. I had to trim some of the fat myself, which was slightly annoying. But once the fat was trimmed I was in steak heaven.  Remember, I'm not a fan of sushi but I did enjoy the shrimp tempura sushi. Guess I can like sushi as long as the fish is cooked.

Parking was insane! It seemed like a skating session was ending but people were lingering; eventually I found a spot after about 10 minutes of circling. By the time I made it up to the second floor & found my girls, it was several minutes after 7pm and they already had a table & drinks.

I'll note now that our server was incredibly attentive. Even though the restaurant was packed & very busy, she checked on us frequently. Once I arrived, she was quick to come over & get my drink order. And when another girl arrived, our server noticed almost immediately & again was promptly at our table.

One of my friends ordered the Ybor Egg Rolls to share and they were amazing! I definitely could've made a meal of this appetizer. They were fun twist on the Cuban sandwich flavors we all know - incredibly tasty & generously filled.

I ordered the Brisket Bender Bowl and LOVED it. The mashed potatoes were not overly garlicky and the brisket was super tender & flavorful. I was eating on this for days!

So, yes, Top Shelf is not obviously located, and is slightly more challenging to visit, but they have some really great food. I was drinking Bud Light with dinner on this night (pacing myself), but one of my girls enjoyed a cocktail & another had a sangria. No one was disappointed. This was a great spot to watch the Lightning game with my girlfriends but I doubt we'll wait until hockey season starts again to return!",2021-07-08 23:45:13

One of the most iconic things about Mike's is definitely the location, in beautiful downtown Nashville. With country music blaring and tourists walking around, it kind of almost feels like home! Once I walked into Mike's the place was packed, and the weather, chilly as ever! Seeing as I was only spending a few days here, I had to go big, triple scoop for $5.50!

Here's the flavors I got:

Red Velvet Cake (4/5):

Chunks of red velvet cake, and the color of the ice cream was a dark red! Something out of a Dr. Seuss book almost! What I loved most about it was the fact that the pieces of cake inside the ice cream were delicate and not dry. Actually pretty moist in combination with the ice cream!

Tennessee Fudge (4.5/5):

Come on now, we're in Nashville, I can't NOT get Tennessee Fudge! Almost like cookies and cream, but the pieces of cookie were bigger and tastier! It was rather delicate on the pallet, and definitely fulfilled my needs as a person with a sweet tooth!

Caramel Cone (4.2/5)

Little chunks of caramel lodged into the ice cream along with a good amount of caramels drizzle, this one was definitely flattering! 

Overall, sitting at Mike's and staring out of the window, it kind of reminded me of a scene in movie. Country music playing and tourists walking by and looking at the various amazing places that make Nashville - well, Nashville. Music City, it clearly holds the title for a reason, and everything here screams life and music.",2016-01-14 22:32:31

Our reservation was ready right when we got there and we sat in the upstairs dining room! Not very loud and a great view! Their menu was so hard to pick from! My party ended up sharing a bunch of appetizers since we couldn't choose just a few! 

1. Tuna tartare and caviar- amazing! My favorite appetizer out of all 6. Flavor is amazing and it spreads so easily on the crackers! Love that it comes with avocado on the bottom! 
2. Pork belly and corn fried oysters- loved these so much! Flavor was great and loved that they came with blue cheese crumbles and ranch! They come in an order of 3, but the ones we got were quite small. Taste was amazing though! 
3. Bianca flatbread- so delicious. More on the plain side on the flatbread options, so we decided to add charcuterie! Definitely added flavor to it! It was cheesy and delish! 
4. Bacon wrapped dates- I love seeing dates on a menu, I was excited to see them served at copper vine. They were warm and delicious! The syrup on top really made them worth it! If you don't like dates, I would still try it! The bacon flavor really changes the way you will think about dates! 
5. Burrata and heirloom tomatoes- literally mouth watering. My second favorite thing and maybe even tied with the tuna! The burrata and tomato mixture was just so good. The cheese was so creamy and the tomatoes had so much flavor. It came with crispy pieces of bread that made the whole burrata experience! 
6. Gnocchi Au gratin- this was good but very heavy. When it came out, it looked like baked Mac n cheese! I like that the top was crunchy and the inside was creamy. This app will fill you up fast if you have too much though!

It's been at least 5 years since I've eaten here, and while it was never my favorite it was decent to occasionally very good.  I only went back because it was a lunch date with my little sister and she picked it out (even though I suggested other places, she likes ""italian"" food and wanted to try this)

I realize everyone is cutting back these days, so I wasn't surprised to see they no longer had fresh cut flowers but other than that the interior was as I remembered it.  Still cozy and lovely with the dim lighting and spacious seating.  

The menu looked different from what I remembered, and they were featuring a promotional tapas for 2 menu.  1 tapa (appetizer) and 1 entree pp.  These were generally the cheaper menu items, but still a savings of $2-$6 pp if you were to order an app and entree each.  I think there was a selection of about 6 different items on each section.  They were out of the only entree that appealed to me and would not make a comparable substitution.  I wanted the chicken and mushroom cannelloni but ended up with a grilled chicken breast with angel hair pasta caprese.  My sister chose a creamy rigatoni dish with chicken.  We shared the goat cheese stuffed peppers and the zucchini fritto.  

The portions were large but the food was disgusting.  The zucchini fritto was paperthin slices of zucchini breaded and fried.  There were burned bits and other bits that were doughy and clumped together.  It lacked flavor and was greasy.  The peppers were interesting, tangy pickled peppers stuffed with cream cheese and heated then topped with fried bread crumbs and balsamic glaze drizzle.  I think they would have been much better served cold.  My sisters pasta was a giant bowl of rigatoni in a watery sauce and slices of chicken breast that look like the type of pressed chicken you get in school lunches.  Even with a lot of added parmesean cheese it was very bland.  My dish was a tough black charred chicken breast (again, tasted like formed chicken)  a glob of solidified angel hair pasta with a few cubes of mozzerella all melted together with wilted basil (I'm guessing my dish sat under a heater for a while).  The arugula salad it was served with was mostly spinach, again wilted with a dab of garlicky pesto.  I had literally two bites of food before I pushed my plate away. The chicken was dry and tough and tasted of salt and char, the pasta tasted of salt and old tomatoes.  I did enjoy the warm bread.  

Aside from terrible food, my final gripe is a petty one.  My sister ordered a peach lemonade and I ordered an ""italian soda"" which was soda water plus the same peach syrup in my sister's lemonade.  These beverages were listed together on the menu (no price listed so I assumed they were overpriced).  They were $3 each, but what annoyed me was that I asked for a refill and was told the soda did not have refills, but the lemonade did.  My soda came in a tall narrow glass packed with ice and could not have held more than 4 oz of liquid in all.  My sister's lemonade was a 20oz glass with about 1/4 full of ice.  I could understand if they opened a fresh bottle of pellegrino per soda, but this was just soda water from a soda gun so I don't see why it would cost more for refills?  Or why it wasn't listed separate from the free refill drinks like tea and lemonade?",2012-03-22 02:13:13

The draw for me was a playground combined with a bar.  What could be bad about that?  I can have a beer or two and my 2 year old can burn energy on the pirate ship playground.  

A few problems.  First, the beer wasn't very good (didn't have any food) and until they refine their brewing, they need to offer at least a few other local brewers' offerings.  Second, somebody is going to get hurt.  There is just too much glassware and areas where kids can fall (adults were not even honoring the no glassware on the pirate ship sign).  It really is just a matter of time.  As another parent put it, ""this is my nightmare.""

I wanted to try a new place with great food and service. As always, I read the reviews and pick my spots. So attempting to visit Bar One was not out of the ordinary. Well, as we walked through the festival, we saw a young lady passing out flyers to everyone. To my surprise, as when we got closer, she looked us in our faces, and turned around...mine you, there was no other individuals close to her to pass out the flyers, then us. At this point, I replied that maybe the business that she was representing had an exclusion policy. At that point, an older gentleman standing near her, heard the remark, apologized, and passed us a flyer. 

To my surprise, the flyer was from Bar One! At that point, we continued to walk to the end of the festival, and I was still interested in visiting Bar One. After reaching the end of the festival, we turned around and began to walk back. As we neared the Bar One vicinity, another gentleman was now passing out the flyers. As we approached closer to go near the front of the Bar One, the gentleman did not look at us to give a flyer to either. It was obvious that this second time within a 45 minute span was NOT an accident. We simply didn't fit the identity of their clientele. Point taken.",2017-05-28 23:10:37

Sadly, they didn't have the containers for sundaes, so we weren't able to try their banana split and also no samples available to test different ice cream flavors. The inside wasn't terribly packed with people, but we didn't feel comfortable sticking around once we got our ice cream.

+ PARKING: Since Downtown Nashville was pretty much dead due to COVID-19, it was extremely easy to find STREET PARKING right across the street from Mike's.

+ FOOD: The ice cream is all hand-made here at Mike's and they offer everything from ice cream scoops on a cone to shakes to ice cream sodas. Their flavors aren't really as wacky as I've seen from some artisan ice cream shops, but interesting enough to put a twist on classic flavors.

We went with your classic STRAWBERRY ice cream and a new-to-us TENNESSEE FUDGE ice cream scoop in a cup. The strawberry was so good! This isn't just your basic store-bought strawberry pint variety. The strawberry ice cream at Mike's comes with generous chunks of strawberry and I swear our ice cream took forever to actually melt. But that's maybe because we gobbled up all our ice cream too fast. It was so smooth and amount of ice cream in their scoops is generous! The strawberry paired really well with their Tennessee fudge. The Tennessee fudge is supposedly their best-selling flavor and it's a vanilla-based ice cream with ribbons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chunks mingled in. Not too rich to the point where my teeth ached, but just enough chocolate to satisfy my craving. The bits of fudge were delicious and I liked how we accidently ended up with a neapolitan ice cream combo with our two scoops.

We were also able to snag some Goo Goo Clusters here! (As if we needed more sugar in system)

+ PRICE: Competitive and even borderline cheap for the amount of ice cream they pack in their scoops. Most artisan ice cream shops I've come across would charge the same price for 2/3 the amount of ice cream Mike's gives you. For two scoops of ice cream (large), they charge about $5. What a steal!

Overall: If you're in Downtown Nashville, give this place a try. I highly recommend their ice cream and it'll keep you cool. Classic flavors and offerings with a little modern twist.",2020-10-02 20:46:00

It started a few weeks ago when requested space for a private party with 25 people within a certain budget. Not only did Mike speedily respond with the friendliest invitation and enthusiasm for our event, he kept up that standard of communication every time we emailed asking for this or that small tweak as our final guest count kept wavering and the party's dietary restrictions filtered in. He provided a quick solution at each turn. 

The food and drink menu choices he offered blew me away with the variety and creativity. Terrific balance of regional specialties and nouveau cuisine choices. I was able to make selections to accommodate all of our known food issues among guests while having a spectacular menu. The contract process was smooth and split up into two payments which made spreading out the cost very convenient. Furthermore the contract was very clearly spelled out and perfectly aligned with my own math, no surprises! 

The service itself was unparalleled. Antonio and Dylan meticulously made sure no one's beverage was empty. They accommodated ad-hock special requests (no mushrooms on one, allowing another guest to order something not on the pre-arranged menu) with cheerful professionalism. With each of the 4 courses, it seemed as though we were all magically served each plate at once. They made sure my mom - the guest of honor - felt honored without provoking any fear of a humiliating public fuss over her birthday. These gentlemen have mastered their craft. 

Onto the food! MY LORD AND ALL THE SAINTS IN HEAVEN was the culinary portion of the party beyond. Beyond what? Everything, that's what. Course 1: We started with caprese skewers - perfectly proportioned with just enough balsamic glaze to pop the flavors of the basil, cheese, and perfectly ripe pretty tomatoes. The goat cheese fig flatbread was another masterpiece of balanced flavors and texture. Course 2: The gumbo was flavorful, obviously made with a rich roux, but light enough to reasonably be a mere amuse-bouche leading up to the stars of the show. However my favorite was the arugula sunflower salad. It's bright citrusy front notes perfectly transitioned into the fresh peppery notes and cool texture of the arugula. Course 3: Wild Shrimp and Grits. Utterly swoon worthy. The alternate Herb-roasted wild mushroom pasta served with a sous-vide egg that upped the intensity of the creamy velvety delightful texture was sheer brilliance. The only reason I didn't finish mine was anticipation of Course 4: Bananas Foster Rum Cake. I swear you will never experience it's equal anywhere else. I'm still fantasizing about it a day later. 

This was truly the event of a lifetime. Every detail was thought of. They care the took to elevate my mother's birthday celebration into an elegant yet festive and intimate epic experience my family will remember forever deserves a loud round of applause. I wish I could nominate them for whatever the equivalent of an Oscar would be in their industry. 

The very last touch of the evening was discreetly  presenting me with a substantial card stock version of the personalized menu cards as my party was saying their goodbyes before dispersing home across the country. This extra touch perfectly personifies the care they poured into every detail, making what I'm sure was epic behind the scenes work seem effortless to us.",2021-12-05 16:04:27

As soon as we arrived, we were brought upstairs and seated close to the balcony. The lighting was gorgeous, as was the moody decor in the room. Our server Antonio greeted us promptly and was a delight!

We ask for menu recommendations, and learned that you truly could not go wrong with anything you ordered. We were told that bottomless brunch was available for $25 per person and that each person needed a meal in order to be served. That worked for us because it was exactly what we planned to do. We were brought small carafes of orange juice and cranberry juice and Antonio filled our glasses with champagne.

To eat, we shared the black truffle fries, bacon wrapped dates, crawfish beignets, and bianca flatbread. For our mains,  a friend and I shared the crab benedict and apple fritter french toast. The bacon wrapped dates were incredible, and we were able to add an additional piece to make it 4 instead of the 3 it usually comes with. Others tried the Ancient Grains Salad and the Shakshuka. Everything was a hit! 

We did not feel rushed to leave, and continued to pick at our plates while we chatted and drank our mimosas. Since our table was 6 people, there was an 18% auto-gratuity added to our check with the ability to tip on top.

The Bar in Tuna Bar is on point- I loved my first cocktail- The Picante (a mezcal drink with grapefruit and jalapeno), but the second cocktail was odd- wasabi and cucumber just tasted like someone blended a cucumber roll, and the wasabi chunks at the bottom were weird.

The Tuna in Tuna Bar is on par with Morimoto, Royal Izakaya and and Double Knot. Beware of the specials though, those prices add up! We had a 3 piece fatty tuna special for $21 and 2 piece yellowtail for $20. That's $41 for 5 pieces of fish. Coulda had 12 mediocre takeout rolls for that price, so it's hard to wrap my head around. But it was really good! They also had some fun looking fancy rolls and we tried the Fishtown Roll -with jalapeno and assorted fish wrapped around shrimp tempura which was very good.

We also enjoyed some apps and sides- the bang bang shrimp, brussel sprouts, lobster fried rice (large portion), and the wok fried crudo were all very good. Before we knew it our check was about $100 each. Not sure if there was dessert, since our waiter just brought the check and rushed us out a bit....

The place was busy on a Thursday night, despite it being in a bit of an odd location). The waiters seemed a bit stressed and the area they had to navigate was so narrow they seemed to constantly be excusing themselves or squeezing past each other. Hopefully they'll get into the groove of things as time goes on.

The fries nothing fancy and I was sorely disappointed in the main item. While there was a ton of fish on the plate, the quantity didn't compensate for the lack of flavor. It was missing the seasoning I was seeking and only made me want to find better fish. I will say the cornbread was good and the slaw, with the mustard base, was delicious with a little kick. Just wish the same attention that went into making the slaw went towards seasoning the fish.

- The space is much bigger - triple?
- The prices are surprisingly the same (but of course most locals think the Magazine Street location is outrageously steep).
- The Cochon de Lait is one of the best in the city: meaty pulled pork dressed with a sloppy creole remoulade slaw inside a hollowed out baguette that just barely contains both (see pics)
- The haystack onion rings are also some of New Orleans' best (you gotta dip them in the house-made ranch).

WHERE ITS AT
This location formerly housed ""And Toto Too"", the over-the-top puppy couturier way before the storm. Not too long ago the best coffee shop in the Quarter, ""Addiction"" was here before it was gentrified out. Now it's a po'boy shop competitively positioned next door to over-priced ""Killer Po'Boys"" and across the street from Deanie's which serves equally pricey but insipid po'boys in the cavernous space that back-in-the-day was Holmes's cafeteria.

My party of 4 had a 6pm reservation for Saturday night. Taylor was our server and she was the bomb.com. She recognized my party had a lot of catching up to do and gave us plenty of time to decide on drinks and food without becoming impatient. 

We started with individual 8oz carafes and as the night went on, opted for the bottle of the nectar of the God's aka the Grenache Rose on the menu.  One guest in our party had a couple of Sazeracs followed by some Crying Eagle beers (he's an Eagles fan, so it fits, ha!)

We ordered shareable apps: the charcuterie board (is it a GNO if you didn't have a cheeseboard?), brussel sprouts, and duck fat fries. All yum! For dinner, my gals ordered the margherita flatbread, the burger, and I had the club sandwich. I'll embarrassingly admit that I can't recall how it was because I was *turnt* but, I'm sure it was delicious! 

Service was top notch! In addition to Taylor being our main server, we had other staff bring our food, clear plates, refill waters very promptly. 

Our bill was..well, reflective of a good time. Pro tip: try to convince yourself to start with the bottle instead of ordering individual glasses.. you'll get there eventually, and it'll probably end up saving you a few $$.

My 3 star review is due to frustration. I went yesterday with a group of people, it was the first gorgeous day so I was looking all over for places that were dog friendly so we could sit outside with our pup. On the website it says verbatim:

""Q: CAN I BRING MY DOGGO??

A: Your pup is more than welcome to join you for a pint but they'll need to stay in the outside seating area. Only service doggos are allowed inside.""

I called numerous times to double check but the phone number sends you right to a voicemail box. Regardless I figured since the website explicitly says dogs are allowed we should be okay. So we load everyone up in the car and take the 25 minute drive. When we arrive I go inside first to see how to get to the outdoor area without going through the bar because of the dog. The bouncer asks me if it's a service dog and I said ""no"" and he told me dogs aren't allowed. I explained to him what the website said and how we were just going to sit outside and he tells me ""this is a people establishment"". It was veryyyy frustrating. I understand dogs not being allowed inside and I even understand restaurants and breweries not being dog friendly, but maybe if you're NOT dog friendly, don't say on your website that you are ... anyway so I had to leave everyone there, drive my pup back home the 25 minutes then turn around and come right back. 

Good food, good beer and cool atmosphere but I guess don't believe anything on their website ...",2019-04-07 11:06:24

I would recommend making a reservation though, especially on the weekend. Our reservation was at 8:30 and our table wasn't quite ready yet when we got there so we got a drink at the bar while we waited. Our table was ready about 15 minutes later at 8:45, but it was worth the wait because they seated us on the first level at a little booth with plush velvet, super comfortable!

Side note: do not forget your ID especially on your birthday! I'm embarrassed to say that I made this mistake (I had switched purses, it's a girl thing) so I had to run home to grab it. So it was fine that our table wasn't ready right away. And the bartender was so nice and felt bad that I had to run home he ended up buying my first drink! I believe his name was Mike, super friendly and great bartender. 

There was just two of us and we ordered 5 dishes which was the right amount of food for us. They are tapas style and made for sharing it seems. Our food also came out pretty quick. We were full by the end but not busting at the seams. They bring each dish out as they are ready instead of bringing it all out at once which I like so you're not waiting for a long time to eat. 

We started off with the wedge salad. It was skewers of lettuce with a ginger dressing on top. Fresh and tasty, although maybe a little pricey. 

Next we had the Okonomiyaki which was delicious. It was a crispy savory hashbrown type pancake with sauces and toppings on top. Highly recommend!

Then we had the Tebasaki Gyoza. Do not be fooled by the name, it is not a gyoza. It is actually a deboned chicken wing stuffed with a mixture of shrimp. There is a chili sauce for dipping. This is probably unusual for most people. The outer crust was super crispy which I loved. It had also come out super fresh and hot. A sign it was made to order and hadn't been sitting for a while. My boyfriend was so so about this dish, but I really liked it. So it depends on the person. 

After came the spicy crab noodles which had come highly recommended. It was very saucy and rich. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be although there was a good amount of crab in there. I would recommend mixing it up before you start as all of our crab and stuff had kind of settled towards the bottom. I didn't end up loving this dish as I had thought I would. The flavors were a bit muddled and maybe a little too rich for me. 

Lastly, we had the ikinari steak. It's American skirt steak on a bed of sweet corn and onions with a generous scoop of the miso butter. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and came out on a sizzling skillet. So for those who don't like their meet too rare, it does continue to cook a bit after it comes out. The steak was super tender and had a sauce on top. For me it could have had a little less sauce so the steak could shine, but still delicious nevertheless. It was a little difficult to eat the corn with chopsticks though haha. I could have asked for other utensils, but I didn't want to be ""that person.""

Overall it was a great experience. The decor instead was beautiful, with a mix of mid century furniture and more luxurious touches like the velvet booths. Everyone we encountered was friendly and our server was great, very knowledgeable and nice. Would definitely come back to try the other dishes.",2019-07-20 17:42:35

The prices are even in line with what you should expect from the Fridays/O.G. Big difference is here they give you crayons so you can doodle on the table while you wait on the next round. I don't doodle. I take colouring very seriously. Don't seat me without a minimum of five colours. Joking of course; I bring my own.

The wait staff is friendly and very efficient. They should crayon their name upside down on your butcher paper. If not, ask them to. It's different and fun.

The wine selection appears to be pretty decent, but I'm not really a wine guy. They see me coming and immediately pull the alcohol glasses from the table. They have a killer ice tea, however!

One disadvantage of aging is limited income. It makes dining out a challenge. The Macaroni Grill folks send us email coupons twice a week. Many times a BOGO. It's a great way to try different dishes and not pay full price. 

Personally, I think they have an exceptional Chicken Parm. The Spaghetti is great, too. The meatballs are a bit spicy so I don't order it very often. I absolutely refuse to come here and not split the Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Mrs. E. I think they add some secret concoction to make you crave them. A-D-D-I-C-T-I-N-G!!!!!! 

It's Italian and that means you're paying more. But they provide a gorgeous atmosphere and very hospitable people. John is one of the best and of course Troy, the big dawg whose name is on the door, is happy to meet you, anytime. 11/19",2019-11-27 04:44:12

I recently spent a long weekend in Santa Barbara with my family and close friends that are renting a house in the area for the month.  Helena Avenue Bakery was the first place we went upon arrival and the last place we visited before our drive back, and I think we stopped by once or twice in between as well.

Some of my favorite menu items from all of those visits:
-Avocado Toast
-Turkey Sandwich
-Kale Caesar Salad
-Homemade Potato Chips
-Hummus and BabaGhanoush

We also purchased some fresh sourdough and country seed bread loaves to-go.  (They will slice it if you ask as long as it's not so early that it's too warm out of the oven to do so).  My kids had their donuts but didn't love them... I think they looked better than they tasted.  I also had a fabulous Americano with almond milk.

Shout-out to Lauren who didn't lose her cool as my husband and I visited first thing on a Sunday before our drive back home and kept adding on to our order.  First it was just coffee and bread, then we decided we needed a sandwich and salad for the road, then we ordered donuts, chips, hummus, etc... Thanks Lauren!

The server and the manager could not have been more hospitable and welcoming. Plus, 2 of the 4 people really enjoyed their meal, meanwhile me and the 4th person were left a little disappointed - in which case I think that averages to a 3/5? The important thing to know, they nailed some of the most traditional New Orleans dishes, so read on and come by if you're in the mood for red fish or etouffee!

The hits: red fish and crawfish etouffee. Husband and best friend split these dishes and raved about them through the rest of our trip. I tried both as someone who is not big on seafood and liked the red fish too. The sides served with the dishes came out cold, but not super important when the main dishes were so good.

The misses: short rib and turkey po-boys. I love salty foods and so when my friend said his short rib po boy was really salty I assumed he was sensitive to saltiness. No way - this was like drinking salty broth that had a mound of salt added to it. The short rib was so tender and juicy, which actually made the problem worse because salty juices flowed into your mouth each bite. My turkey po boy bread was pretty stale - I acknowledge we came close to closing time but the staleness took away from the sandwich and beyond the bread, I didn't think the turkey po boy was anything special. I did see the potential in the short rib though - that meat was so well cooked outside of the saltiness.

The specialty mule we ordered tasted pretty bland. Almost like it was made with sugar free ginger beer where it lacks that ""bite."" Or maybe it has just gotten watered down. 

Bottom line I really like the environment and staff was so great - I think it's worth visiting for the seafood and just reading through reviews to navigate your order.",2019-10-28 19:27:24

The food came very quickly and even though at first glance, it looked very little, it was actually quite filling. There was a good ratio of vegetable to rice and the sauce was definitely a good kick of flavour. The staff was very nice. 

The only downside was that it was pretty expensive for just one bowl of rice. I know it was a bit cheaper than other places that serve bibimbap by around ~$1-2 but there were no side dishes served at this place, which I thought made the price not as worth it even if it was cheaper by a bit.

XFUJl1jY6XTdABHjSpZdKA,Ygtgx1jujypOQcxUB5T9yg,YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,2.0,0,0,0,"NO WAY is this a 4+ Star restaurant.  Five of us with a reservation on a Saturday night.  It was 6pm we were on the early side they weren't slammed yet.  Appetizers took forever. Crawfish beignet were fine a little stringy, considerable filler.  The carrots were fine too. Black truffle fries were crap.  Heavily doubt that the fires were made in house.  It would legitimately would have been better to doordash fries from McDonalds or Wendys to get a better quality fry with ""truffle"" oil on them.  

We got three salads that were fine, but WHY o WHY did they think it was OK to drop the entree's on the table about 90 seconds after the salads arrived.  That is a cardinal sin of table serving. Stacking freshly prepared food in front of a diner and forcing them to choose: 1) let something get stale or cold, 2) make a fuss and ask them to take it back (it's just going to sit under a heat lamp) if you make them cook it fresh, then wait 30 minutes while the rest of your party eats uncomfortably.  TWO of us had salads before our entree and be both had hot food crowding out or place setting with a full salad sitting in front of us. 

The Gulf Fish Almondine was truly weird and worse for it.  Fish almondine should be cooked in a pan with a butter sauce -- or broiled or baked -- with a garnish of almonds.  I understand artistic riffs on this that can still be excellent.  But if you promote yourself as a seafood town because you're next to the ocean, why would you create a fish almondine that has a HARD, THICK batter that totally overpowers a delicate protein like fish?  It made no sense and the crust really took away from a nice piece of fish.  It says ""champagne cream sauce""  Delicate, right?  NOWHERE on the menu does it say that this dish with a classic name was not going to be prepared classically and have an unacceptably thick breading on it.  

honestly, if they hadn't rushed the entrees on top of the salad or at LEAST apologized, I would have gone another star.  But we did everything right -- made a rez, waited patiently when things were slow, didn't raise hell with awful service errors -- and they did too many things wrong.",2021-11-20 14:54:09

Ordered the green eggs and ham and it was actually quite filling. The square egg was fluffy and soft. Brioche bun was delicious and has a slight crisp which I loved.

The nice surprise was actually the sourdough bread with olive. It was about $10 (or $12 I can't remember). It's actually sour but not to the point that you get a bitter aftertaste. It's so clearly hand-made since the air bubbles inside are uneven. The bread has a nice crisp on the outside and it's very soft on the inside. Also quite chewy!

This restaurant, like much of St. Louis is going for a classic elegance. Unfortunately, this place falls far short and is extremely average. Everything from the decorations (imagine faux finish walls that change colors every 5 feet, perhaps trying to mimic the colorful facades of an Italian village but really just invoking a circus tent) to the humdrum (and very pricey) wine list shoots for the stars but like the Challenger barely makes it into the stratosphere. In fact I might go so far as to say if you're looking for Italian you'd be better served at the Olive Garden, where they at least offer fresh ground pepper or cheese for your entrees and salads.

My meal was plain Jane. I was looking for something light and healthy. Almost everything on the menu was advertised as served under a beure blanc sauce or a cream based sauce. Therefore I chose a seafood pasta with tomato sauce. Expecting some hearty prawns and delicious fresh vegetables, instead I got a mash of overcooked spaghetti with pasty sauce that tasted like a reduction of Chef Boyardee. My boyfriend had the house special, a $25 risotto that tasted like Uncle Ben's, but worse. 

Thankfully, the evening was not a complete waste as I boxed up my spaghetti, brought it home, added some wine, vegetables and fresh parmesan cheese substantially improving the meal. Perhaps before you consider eating here, you should think about cooking for yourself or going to the Olive Garden.",2011-02-07 00:37:24

We had Purchased the gift card for Costco so it's like having a 20% discount. Macaroni Grill is a bit expensive, however the food quality has a high standard. 

When we arrived, it was kind of strange because the place was deserted. The waitress/hostess that greeted us was very friendly and sat us immediately. She was friendly and professional. The only concern I have is that she wore an extreme amount of perfume. It made me gag when she came by the table to ask us for drinks. Also, when she brought the bread and olive oil, the bottom of the bread was rockhard. The top was soft however we could not cut through the bottom without a saw. Our server care of this immediately. It was kind of hard to taste the bread with the perfume wafting around us. 

The price has definitely increased as the bottle of wine was quoted at $48. I remember just before Covid being here and the bottle is $32. So I asked for a wine list. She said they did not have one but she knew everything about the wines. Luckily I had an old picture of the wine menu and showed it to her. She went to check the prices and then quoted me $38 for a bottle and apologized. It is somewhat difficult to not have the ability to look at the list of wines and their prices. Especially when you were quoted $16 more than the last time you visited.

What we ordered:

Drinks: went with a bottle of wine. My wife likes sweeter wines so I ordered a bottle of Reisling (Chateau St. Michelle) 

Lamb Shank 
Steak and mash
Grilled asparagus 

The food is extremely good. The lamb shank pulled apart with a fork. The steak was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. My wife really loved the style of mashed potatoes. For a side of asparagus, it seemed a bit small. But it was definitely cooked nicely.

I do hope the waitress reads this review and adjust her perfume. With a sidenote, if you wear the same perfume over and over, sometimes you get desensitized to the smell and you have to apply more so you can smell it. Overtime this builds up and the result is suffocating for others.

Try something else, even if you're from above the Mason Dixon line and feel obligated to try anything with ""red velvet"" in the name. I hear that can take you to dark, dark places...

I'm going to be contrary now and state that nothing red velvet-flavored is all that special except for red velvet cake. 

The texture of the ice cream was quite good. I got two scoops on a chocolate chip cone, which actually seems to be a rolled, dense cookie instead of a traditional ice cream cone. Cool.

I'm going to be contrary AGAIN and state that I was hoping the chocolate chip cone would be a traditional waffle cone with chocolate chips. How awesome would that be?

I appreciated that the cookie cone remained structurally intact. They'd put a plastic guard around the cone to keep melted ice cream for getting all over your hands. It seems that they'd factored in that Mike's is a heavy tourist draw and that people would be walking around while eating their ice cream.

I'm going to be contrary AGAIN and AGAIN and say that I appreciated all the tourist-driven innovations but Mike's was not worth $6 for a two-scoop ice cream cone. It felt a bit like extortion, especially when phenomenal places in NYC, SF and Boston charge less for three scoops. I typically abandon my sense of value when it comes to ice cream and I still felt offended.

The pricing would not stop me from coming back to Mike's on subsequent trips to Nashvegas. It's quite good and so conveniently located that it's hard for me to say no. Mike's is great for that very specific ice cream craving that comes when you're indulging in tourism in a party atmosphere in a hot city. It more than does the trick and far exceeds the quality of most places that exist to satisfy that need. If you're looking for real quality though, I hear it's best to wait for Jeni's.",2014-05-08 19:56:11

Do book a reservation. We were glad to have one as the restaurant filled up completely within a half hour of our arrival. Servers seemed to be a little stressed and we had to flag our server down a couple times when we needed something after our initial order.

I typically stick with wine or vodka martinis when I have sushi, but after tasting my friend's cocktail I ordered the same. It was a mezcal drink with lime and jalapeño syrup that was absolutely delicious. My friend later ordered a gin martini with wasabi - the taste was really fresh and interesting but the wasabi wasn't mixed in well and she encountered a few larger nuggets which made the drink a little weird. 

We ordered several plates and highlights for me were the lobster fried rice, crispy rock shrimp, fishtown roll and one of the specials of the day, some fresh yellowtail, which was absolutely incredible. 

If there is dessert on the menu, we wouldn't know, because our check was dropped without us even asking for it. Not exactly the warm vibe I'm expecting when spending upwards of $100/person.

Although we passed on their drink specials, we did order their $6 dumplings and a spicy salmon roll. As for drinks, we both ordered off of the cocktail list. She got the Shiso Picate which comes with mezcal and jalapeño and I got the Winston's Heat with gin, wasabi and cucumber. We both loved our drinks - so much so that we were happy to get a second round!

First off the ambiance was so romantic and cute! The tables have a candle light and there were Christmas lights around. Super cute! We were seated right away and given menus. Our waitress was one of the best waitress ever!! She refilled my water on point, gave us more bread and olive oil without even us asking for more! After we got our food, she came over to check on us. Great service! I read some of the previous reviews didn't have the same great service we had so I was very grateful.

As far as for the food itself- totally 5 stars as well!! The duck pate was delicious, rich and flavorful. The fried beef tips were tender and flavorful all on its own that I didn't even need the dipping sauce. I ordered the Lamb Tagine which was a great choice! The lamb had some really fatty parts but the meat was so tender, it was practically falling off the bones! The sauce and vegetables just bought the whole thing together! My boyfriend got the lobster pasta which was rich, creamy and also had good flavor. There were big chunks of lobsters in the pasta as well!

I ordered a large fries and an order of clam strips.  Their fries are usually so amazing that I won't pass them up.  Crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle.  They are french fry heaven.  I'd been thinking of branching out and trying something different, so I ordered the clam strips which were on the appetizer menu.

When I placed the order, the man at the counter asked me if they were the appetizers and I said yes.  He told me he'd ring it up as a platter and that would save me a little money.

And THAT was my mistake.  I should have said, ""no thanks,"" because that platter didn't save me any money at all.

I live a short 5 min from the store.  When I got home, I opened the container to find the fries sitting on top of a salad.  Let's forget that I didn't order salad.  Salads are cold.  French fries are hot.  Dumping hot fries on a cold salad does what to those two foods?  It turns the salad into slimy, limp, warm slop.  It also made their normally crispy fries WET and limp.

As if that weren't bad enough, the clam strips weren't strips. They looked like overcooked little balls and they were all over the fries and the salad.  All of this was in a styrofoam container that was all wet inside from the steam build up.

That entire box was $9.25 + tax of inedible crap and went right in the trash.  

Fine.  Lesson learned.  Next time I want fries, I'll order from the appetizer menu.  And I'll pass on the clam ""strips"" and stick with the two items I know are fantastic: the cheesesteaks and the burgers.

Last year, when restaurants could not have dine-in services, we took a chance and ordered our holiday dinner from Sunset 44 Bistro and we were blown away by the delicious food we took home!  Additionally, the person I spoke to on the phone when placing my order was very pleasant and personable and sometimes, the little things can really make or break the experience. 

On Friday night, I decided to make reservations here.  We were able to get a table for 6PM.  Parking was a bit tricky but the parking lots by the building actually has signs stating that apartments and restaurant patrons are authorized to park there.  When we got in, we were seated immediately.  Our waitress, whose name escapes me at the moment was very attentive and pleasant.

We started out with some drinks.  I had a glass of cabernet and my husband had a beer.  Then we ordered some smoked trout to start.  We have had their smoked trout before during another curb-side order occasion and we both enjoyed it.  Their lavoush are so crisp and perfect to go with the smoked trout.

For my main, I ordered a filet mignon medium rare serviced over mashed potato, green beans and some marchand de vin.  It was simply amazing!  The filet was 6 oz but I could not eat the entire thing. Maybe because I also saved a little bit of room for dessert?  Speaking of dessert, I completed our meal with not one but 2 scoops of their homemade peach ice cream served with some whipped cream, sliced peaches and fresh berries. Yum!  

I was already impressed with Sunset 44 Bistro before actually being able to dine here but our dine-in visit only solidified my love for this wonderful establishment.

He said it ""would be a while"" in an incredibly rude tone of voice after I told him the name for the order and that it was an online order. The next customer that came in for an online order was told to ""get in line!"" In an extremely rude tone of voice. He then told the single customer in line that he does not serve ""invisible customers"" before those in line at the store. He repeated this multiple times aggressively to the customer and to another staff member. (It should be noted I placed the online order 15 minutes before walking in and I still waited 15 minutes past the time it was supposed to be ready.) When another customer came in to order through the line he at one point asked her to lower her mask to place her order (he was not masked). She was clearly uncomfortable with this request. Eventually he did ask me again what the order name was and I told him, he proceeded to roll his eyes. At this time he had still not started making my order and it was only made eventually when another employee returned from lunch. At no point did any customer including myself do or say anything to incite his hostility - he was clearly angry to begin with and did not want to make any online orders. All in all it was an extremely unpleasant experience that took three times as long as it should have.

I'd originally planned to go to one of the newer spots but I've been here many times and knew they wouldn't disappoint me. I wish the rest of the city was like Chinatown that place is always jumping it feels like NYC. 

Service 4.5/5
The counter lady was all business but the two people in front of me were elderly and I thought she could have been a little gentler with their cake box. I'd a feeling there was an actual cake inside and the man commented to me that ""this is a peaceful place,"" right before she slammed his cake box on the counter. Now he epitomized customer loyalty but I could see (though he didn't say it) he didn't feel appreciated by the counter lady. A loyal customer is special and should be treated accordingly. 

Ambiance 3/5
I've been here before it's not peaceful. But I enjoyed the people watching. There are usually senior citizens sitting together watching the news in Chinese with a cup of coffee or tea it's lovely to see them. And even better b/c the scent of coffee wafting through the cafe/bakery smelled divine. I didn't order it though b/c I'm a habitual insomniac so no caffeine for me after 2pm.

Egg tart 3/5
Though it was delicious it was way too sweet for me and i love sweets. The tart crust was perfect but the egg custard was too sweet. I won't order it again although it was very creamy and otherwise cooked perfectly.

Rainbow cake 5/5
Not too sweet - it was perfect and just the right amount of frosting. The sponge cake was moist and had the right texture. I basically have the pallet of a little kid so if i see rainbow sprinkles i say yes please.

I wound up getting the burger and fries combo which is always pretty good here. Mind you I just said I wasn't that hungry and barely finished my food. My wife ordered the sauteed mushroom melt and hers was so big, we could have split that instead. 

Overall, I will definitely just stick to Thursday mostly because as much as I love the kids play area, I could see my daughter was overwhelmed by the amount of kids and didn't have as much fun which is half the reason we come, but that's nothing the business can control.

uB1jgqWzKygs-OVaaVRtag,hzEHbzC49hFmFIZxMY47JQ,tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg,4.0,7,0,4,"TGP has two stand-out features: Ambience (Read date night!) and rare ingredients. 

Compared to other haute cuisine restaurants, there are few of this grandeur. It is mid-century, dimly lit, with grand emerald green velvet seats and walls of the same color. It's going to give date night spots in town a run for the money. The vibe is upscale with house lounge music (loud and could be toned down). Plus, the serving ware is gorgeous. The dish added to the beauty of the dish. (I dunno how I felt about wooden chopsticks, though. It's definitely more practical, but did take away from the elegance). So just for the ambience TGP deserves more than 5 stars. 

TGP has a well curated menu. There is plenty to choose from, although vegetarian options maybe limited. They use fine quality ingredients like Jidori chicken, and mushrooms too fancy to google (kidding!). Also, there isn't sushi, ramen or yakitori for dinner. The portions are small, sharing size, but given Japanese cuisine is all about clean light and bright flavors, those elements alone will satisfy your appetite. The menu is divided into Cold and Hot; within the hot, light to heavy dishes.

The Sunomono: To dumb it down-fancy poke. To elevate it- fresh, cooling, and edible flowers. The moonfish is gorgeous and the coolness from the cucumber ironically punches through. 

Tebasaki gyoza: You haven't had chicken wings like this before. The inside is filled with shrimp. I don't know where the croissant is, in the filling or the crumb coat, but either way, stuffed wing like no other. Delicious, light, juicy and crunchy with an element of surprise. The sweet chile sauce seemed like the regular kind, I couldn't tell if it was house-made. 

Ikinari steak: Don't let the size fool you. It is rich and a very heavy dish. Comes out in a sizzling skillet. A huge dollop of miso brown butter, looks like gold and feels as rich, makes the steak outstanding. The skirt steak is cooked to perfection-  medium rare, tender juicy and a delicious char and asian flavor. The caramelized onions and corn really compliment the richness from the butter and sauce. Great fusion. 

Fried Tempura Chocolate Cake: I am not a big fan of the chewiness in mochi, so I went with the extreme opposite: texture bomb! This is a molten chocolate cake fried in tempura batter with dulce de leche sauce, with a side of ice cream, topped with sauteed puffed rice. So you have the ooey goeey, the crispy, crunchy, hot cold, solid and liquid.  Decadent, much? Most definitely. 
In spite of the multiple textures, it felt one note- very sweet. I wish they had some salt or citrus to cut the richness. 

Granted, I have not had enough Japanese food of this kind to compare so I may not be the best judge. I think the food is delicious and of high quality, but I just wasn't wowed by the flavors. It was an elevation of the quality and ingredients of the familiar asian flavors.

They have midday and lunch offerings too which would be great to try out. Prices are comparable, portions depending on the item maybe on the smaller side. 

The service is great. We actually went with the recommendations of our host who told us about the dishes. There is ample seating. 

The reason I was a little annoyed, I picked the wrong premier parking garage downtown (222 parking is the closest to TGP) and by the time I walked over to catch the midday menu, with ten minutes to spare till dinner at 5pm I couldn't order off it. So although the midday is till 5 it isn't. But I agree that's me being pesky. 

Nonetheless, next time. TGP is a great addition to downtown. The upscale Japanese food makes it very unique. And it is a very promising restaurant.",2018-11-21 19:59:46

This place is still fairly new, and right now, it's being talked about by a lot! My friends and I wanted to try this spot during the Mardi Gras week and see what it's all about. 

The place looks great! Just right on Poydras, this place has a pretty fair selection of wines to try and food and snacks to munch on! The place inside was packed, and for some reason, their upstairs rooms were not open that day, so we had to sit outside during the night. It was fairly cold, and disappointingly, there were no lights outside and no heaters. However, the outside looked great and the soft chairs were pretty comfortable to sit on and relax. A lot of us ordered different wines and mixed drinks. We also ordered Herb Roasted mushroom pasta, Short rib, Wagyu Burger, Duck Fat Fries, 3 Pork Bellies, and a Smoked Salmon. 

First off, I could appreciate the selection of wines they had to offer, not bad at all. They also had a ""Flight"" option where you can try a small amount of 3 different wines. What shocked me was that these wines were sort of expensive. The server that brought out the ""Flights"" for my friends got a lot of the wines mixed up and was confused on who ordered what, sort of disappointing. As for the food, most of it was pretty lackluster, but not bad. The Duck Fat fries were $8 and it was nothing more but fries with a little cheese on top. EASY pass. We ordered 3 orders of the Pork Belly, but the dishes were inconsistent. My dish in particular was surrounded by a sauce while the other 2 didn't. I didn't know what the dish was supposed to look like. The Pasta was overcooked and lacked some flavour. The short ribs were nothing more that just shirt ribs to be honest. Lacking in flavour and just pretty underwhelming. If the burger did not have the Wagyu name in it, I would've just thought it was a regular burger, which it pretty much is, again, underwhelming. And finally.. that SALMON was $16!! The salmon was TINY and it came with about 5 pieces of small toast to share. Again, pretty standard, yet , EXPENSIVE.

Overall, this place isn't bad if you wanna come has some wines and snacks to eat and have some cheese plates, however, you're gonna spend a good bit. Nothing impressive for my first trip, I don't think this place would come across my mind again unless someone suggested.",2019-03-12 04:45:02

It was just past 7am when I walked in. There was one couple seated, but the kitchen was teeming with staff baking away! What a cool sight!

Though there only appeared to be a few dedicated parking spaces, I had no trouble finding a spot close by.

It was so quiet - I think because it's so new.  We were the only ones in there from 9:30PM on.  The staff and service were fantastic.  Our waiter, Brion, was attentive to our needs and quick to provide recommendations (which turned out incredible!).  Ken Sze, the owner/executive chef also came out towards the end of our meal to make sure we were happy and satisfied.  We chatted with him on our way out and he was very pleasant!  

Onto the food!  We had a number of appetizers.  We tried the scallop crudo on recommendation and this was one of the best dishes of the night.  This MELTS in your mouth.  You must have this.  We also had the pork gyoza, creamy rock shrimp, mai fried rice, and wagyu beef egg rolls.  All were delicious and would highly recommend.  The wagyu beef egg rolls were on special but I asked that they put it on the full menu when it is released!

That night they where running a special on ""FISH BOWLS"" which in my opinion is just watered down flavored liq in a cheap plastic bowl that is just the most annoying thing to walk around with. But if you are a freshman at W.C.U. and or a chick that wants to get ""Wild"" on a sugar high, its something that you might enjoy. 
So onto the food. I started off with there Fried Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella which had to be some of the best Ive ever had. I assumed that the ""Buffalo"" was for the fact that there where pretty large. Come to find out they where made with Buffalo milk. Main course was Doc's Signature Burger, nothing out of the ordinary just a delicious burger with fries .

These chain restaurants must all have the same consulting company because they all have the same routine going on.  Elaborate theme oriented exterior that tries to be ""fun"", brightly colored laminated menus, ridiculous themed interiors, nearly identical websites, signature appetizers, and terrible food.  

Jimmy Buffet's foray (cash  grab) into the restaurant racket boasts cheeseburgers.  They are not bad, but in the end the industrial nature of the restaurant cancels out the positives.  My burger was juicy and cooked as I requested but did not come with what the menu said it would come with: jalapenos, sour cream, and pepper jack cheese.  Instead I received some sort of chemically altered dairy slab, No sour cream, and pickles.  

The food was just not discussion worthy.  

Our server must  have been playing hide  and seek.  Annoying.

The interior is pathetic for all but individuals below the age of 20.  The bar has a fake straw roof to give the impression you are on the beach.  Only you never feel like you are on the beach.

My server explained that dressed po'boys come with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayonnaise while undressed po'boys contain only the meat or seafood filling on the bread.

After a proper indoctrination to po'boys, I settled on the grilled shrimp remi from the dressed up menu. The sandwich featured grilled jumbo gulf shrimp, fried green tomatoes, remoulade, and lettuce. I'm not a fan of dressing, so I ordered the remoulade on the side and I found the sandwich tasty and delicious without it.

I called ahead to find out if there was valet at the restaurant in which I was told yes there is. This was great bc we didn't have to pay for uber etc. so when we arrive to the valet stand there is no one in sight and a line of cars parked on the street. Essentially no where legally for us to park to wait for the valet. When we see the valet run up I got out to hand him my keys hoping he knows better than I where we can park our car and he can take it from there. He snaps at us he's swamped and that we need to legally park and to pay a $12 fee for the valet before he can help us. I understand he is working alone on a Saturday night but the attitude was unnecessary. We ended up parking in a garage right down the street and The green pheasant validated it, I feel for the guy but he could have been more pleasant and apologetic. Two people working the stand could probably solve the problem. Then when I arrive my friends I'm meeting are waiting at the bar explained we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. They'd been waiting at least ten minutes bc of the valet situation and we let the hostess know we are all there and she forgot about us. We reminded her promptly but we didn't feel like we got a warm welcome. Everything was exponentially better once we were seated and welcomed by our waitress Lauren, who goes by L2. She was warm and informative. All the food we ordered was delicious. If I were to rate this place based on the food and Lauren's service alone it would be 5+stars! I definitely would recommend this place to friends but I would tell them either uber or skip the valet all together and park in the garage and have the restaurant validate the parking.

I tend to be drawn to the more unusual ones that you don't most other places.  Some flavors are better than others, but really I think that's a personal preference issue.  So far my favorite is the banana pudding ice cream that I had maybe a year ago.  Yesterday I opted for the key lime pie based on the Yelp reviews, and while it was ok, it wasn't anywhere near my favorite.  I walked away thinking I should have tried the red velvet.  But, that's the risk you take unless you continually order the same flavor.  And, with so many options, where's the fun in that?

Tremendous wine list by the glass with draft wine at the ideal temperature for red or white. The bartender was full of great suggestions and led me to a fantastic Cabernet blend by Italics and a surprisingly smooth and drinkable Petit Syrah. 

Definitely set up to promote conversation with large tall top tables and a comfortable bar area complete  lots of lush plants to make it feel more intimate. Appropriate lighting and volume level to ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION AND NOT BE ON YOUR PHONE ALL NIGHT. Imagine that ;)

The food was reasonably priced and pretty tasty and actually came out quickly (even though they warned us of long ticket times in advance due to a computer glitch). We got the goat cheese and fig flat bread and the deviled eggs along with the tomato soup. The tomato soup was by far my favorite - acidic with just a hint of creaminess to even it out and a ton of garlic. With a slab of bread, it would have been heaven on a slightly chilly night. The deviled eggs had great mustardy flavor, but not the best value on the menu for $8 for 3 - there was supposed to be some crab as well but it was pretty minimal. The flatbread was tasty as well - nice thin yeasty crust with a bunch of goat cheese and a fig drizzle but I would have liked a little bit more accoutrement on top (Maybe some veg, arugula, fig pieces?) even though I enjoyed every last bite.

Walking in, there's a ton of seating on cozy couches or regular high top tables. What's unique about this place is that it has an indoor playground, so it is kid and adult friendly!

They don't do table service so you have to order everything at the bar, but there is a large food menu with the usual bar fare (pizza, sandwiches, fries) with about 10 beers, 5 wines, 5 cocktails and a cider choice. 

The beers and ciders were pretty good, and the food was fairly average. Our group ordered fries, pizzas and some pulled pork sandwiches - nothing stood out too much. I did enjoy my unfiltered cider, which was a tad too sweet but still good.

It's a great place to go for a casual hangout for multiple people, and a unique spot where you can bring your kids and still have a beer.",2019-04-13 14:55:33

We thought there was table service, but immediately saw about a dozen signs saying otherwise. The next thing we noticed was the size of this place. It is HUGE! You could easily have a wedding here. 

After looking around for a minute, we noticed the kids play area, which is mostly why we decided to come here. Upon further investigation, we realized it was more suited for older kids, but it was still a good mix of things. Climbing structures, slides, a pirate ship, games and swings. 

We walked over to the bar and ordered some food. I got the BBQ wings and a cheeseburger, the wife got a tuna melt and we got the kiddo a burger. We walked around the play area a bit while we waited, and in probably 15 min or so, the food was already at our table. 

I'm jumping right into the food here because we all know that's the most important part. The wings were good. Really good. Super crispy, hot and with just a little sauce, the way I love them. The French fries that came with the kid's burger were also hot and crispy with just enough salt. If we had just gotten those 2 things, this place would have been an easy 5 stars, but that was not the case. 

The burgers were very well done, thin, unseasoned and were most definitely frozen prior to our arrival. Sorry, but throwing on a bunch of lettuce, a LOT of mayo and 5 pickles, PLUS a pickle on the side, does not mask the taste of a hockey puck. Also, the pickles are bread and butter pickles I believe. No one likes those. My wife, who loves pickles, actually spit hers out. Later after we had finished eating, I also saw a man at another table spit a chunk of his pickle out as well. It was a sad day for pickles. 

The tuna melt, which my wife barely touched was not great either. The tuna, even though it was flavorful, was cold, the bread was soggy and someone just threw on a piece of cheese, put the whole thing under the broiler for a second and by the time it reached the table, the cheese was already room temperature. There was also a lot of relish on top of the whole thing, which made it prettier, but didn't help overall. 

This place is good for a quick bite with kids in tow. I would not recommend coming here if you're looking for a nice dinner. Have a beer, have some fried food, let the kids run around and you'll be more than satisfied.",2020-02-06 00:46:11

While I was trying to figure out what to order the girl at the counter gave me some suggestions as I didn't know what I wanted to order.

It was SO delicious! I don't know why I never had tried this earlier. The toast had the perfect amount of cheese and honey. The ricotta tasted so fresh probably was the best I've ever had.

The soup surprised me. It had a nice amount of cheese along with good flavor in the broth. My expectations suddenly were raised. 

The sandwich was huge. It was overloaded with chicken and cheese and had a great Cajun bite to it. Most importantly it was juicy. Grilled chicken sandwiches often dry out. This one was perfect.

It's very cabin, woodsey oriented. There are some animal heads on the walls, and a real stuffed bear as you enter. There are too many tv's to count. The waitresses are wearing short shorts and low cut tops, just as I or anyone would expect, but not so much as to embarrass me or themselves. I'm glad I went, because now I know. I would have given 5 stars except they were out of the first two items I tried to order. We had a great waitress named Ina. She was so nice and proficient. All waitresses should take a lesson from Ina.  My friend Karie ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla which she had once before and loved that. My husband Tony wanted fish and chips, but they were out of them so he got a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and mustard. It comes with onion-but he doesn't like it. I ordered fish and chips when Tony did. My next choice was the breaded Tenderloin...nope-our of that too. (third times a charm) ok-6 bone in wings and fries. Here it comes!! My 6....sigh... I got boneless wings?? Ok, why call them wings?? Folks in food land everywhere,,, here's some news form me me to you; There's no such thing as boneless wings. It's little chunks of chicken, breaded and deep fried!! That's why people like me order bone in chicken wings. I was offered some actual wings to go, free of charge. Ina is the best, but I wouldn't do that. I should have spoke up instantly if it was a really big deal to me. I'm sure we will come back and if we do we will ask for Ijna.",2020-09-15 19:44:09

The one who served me got my ice cream, left me to wait at the register a bit to serve someone else, and then asked me how it was despite the fact that it was visibly untouched; she was a tad busy. I used to think understaffed businesses just had owners who were being cheap, but in the COVID era who knows.

I might have thought that my flavor choices of chocolate raspberry truffle and mint white chocolate oreo were unique, but I was bemused to read someone else's review where they ordered the same combination. These must be winning flavors. I actually liked the truffle even better than my mint chip but both were abundant in complexity. It was a mild winter day, but I did consider their large selection of specialty hot chocolates as well. They didn't seem to have much in the way of non-dairy frozen desserts, but their beverage selection offered multiple alternative milks so at least there's something if you need. I guess because they're open late downtown they see themselves as a bit of a convenience store as they had Tylenol and a few other random things for sale at the register.

It wasn't quite so good that I would rule out ever trying another dessert in Nashville, but their flavor selection is more than the basics and it is good.",2022-01-15 03:27:53

I am not a huge fan of po-boys because I'd rather order a seafood platter but we were definitely in for a treat.  Visited here for a bachelorette weekend dinner and everyone had a great food experience. Our server was amazing. It was Labor Day & Southern Decadence weekend, so every restaurant was packed but she was ""on point.""  
Our table appreciated the excellent customer service throughout our entire dinner and also enjoyed the great energy at the restaurant. The GM stopped by our table and checked in on us which I personally appreciated.  Fries were hot, ALL of our po-boy sandwiches were flavorful and filling, their fried pickles and sauce were worth having again and best of all, we got our separate checks in a timely fashion at the end of our dinner.

HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and can't wait to return when I revisit NOLA. :)",2019-09-25 15:48:16
